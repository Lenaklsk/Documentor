                "What kind of image did you have as a 24-year-old of the GDR or of Germany at that time?\n How did that come about?\n Yes, difficult. So you have to say, I came for the first time, I had the feeling of being free.\n In the GDR?\n Yes, that sounds a bit contradictory, but free from any financial worries.\n I felt really welcome there.\n And I just say that it has to do with the fact that the German kindergarten system\n works on the basis of German, German-Bundeskindergarten laws.\n If you know them, you take care of them, you get along with the kindergarten friends\n excellently. If you disregard them, no matter how old you are,\n no matter what education you have, you are not their friend.\n And that's why I think we should see it that way,\n that if we compare it with the general society,\n for example our basic law, everything is regulated there.\n And in the group where I was, the topic was education aspects,\n of course education participation of people with a gender background. Everything is regulated there. And in the group where I was, the topic was education aspects,\n of course education participation of people with a migration background was the topic\n that I then tried to thematize, but also the financing.\n You had negotiations with CSU-Lern about migration policy?\n Yes, that was necessary. That was, yes, that was, that was, now we have to avoid it.\n Yes, that was a little bit avoidable.\n So, a new episode of Jung & Naiv. We are at the Reichstag. Where exactly? We are on the third floor of the Reichstag building.\n And who are you?\n I am Karamba Diaby. I am a member of the Bundestag and of the SPD. My electorate is Halle an der Saale. So now we are in the Bundestag. Was there a vote today?\n Today there were at least four votes.\n One was about the family gathering and the search for family members of subsidized refugees.\n And we voted on that today.\n What else?\n We had several votes overall over the course of the time.\n We also had votes on the topic of Bundeswehr use.\n So today it wasn't yesterday.\n And then there were individual amendments, amendments from the opposition,\n which we also voted on.\n So that was several votes.\n I just realized,\n we were talking about party financing today.\n That too.\n We had that at the beginning today.\n And of course,\n the parties are working with increased\n need for means due to all the digitalization We work with increased demand for digitalisation and communication.\n All these opportunities have become more expensive.\n The parties have then realised that there is a deficit in the area of party funding. and that they can do their job properly, that they can really do constitutional work,\n which gives them the opportunity to get involved in social education.\n It is important that the parties can work properly.\n Did you agree to all of this today?\n I have agreed to all the proposals that were there today.\n No, I did not agree to the opposition's changes, because I think that what the government has agreed to as a proposal to\n support the opposition is a compromise between the CDU and the SPD.\n I agreed to this proposal and rejected it by the opposition parties.\n Have you ever not voted with your faction or coalition?\n This hasn't happened yet, but in the last election period, for example,\n when the asylum law was being intensified, when we were looking for the exclusion of the family\n and especially for children, unaccompanied minors, so that they can not see their families.\n I had rejected that.\n You were also always in the federal parliament?\n I have once, I don't remember exactly, but it's all in memory.\n There are many, many laws.\n I only once did not share the government opinion.\n Since when do you sit in the Bundestag?\n I've been in the German Bundestag since 2013.\n That was my first election period from 2013 to 2017.\n And now I'm in the second election period.\n Did you dream, after you...\n I don't know if you graduated, but after you left school,\n that you would sit in the German Bundestag at some point?\n No, that's not true.

No, you can't.\n So they assigned you.\n They told me, we have a chemistry course for you.\n Originally I was actually allowed to study electronics.\n During the language course, I was told that we don't have a chemistry or electronics degree for you.\n You know little about the social planning industry, but I can tell you about it.\n And then they said that we don't have any place for you in the electronics area.\n As a solidarity scholarship, that's what we were called.\n But we have chemistry.\n I said thank you.\n I am grateful that you have a place to study for me,\n that you offer me something in the field of natural sciences.\n I take it with gratitude and then I studied chemistry.\n Although there was really electronic planned, but I also\n liked to do chemistry and later as a diploma chemist and later\n promoted in the field of geo-ecology.\n I hated chemistry in school back then.

I won't do that.\n But then I accepted.\n How did it go after the promotion?\n After the promotion, I was at the university.\n I was working there as a permanent employee.\n Before that, I was also a student.\n I got a job for a short time.\n Then I left the university because I no longer had a job.\n I then started working as a interpreter, several African languages and French\n and then I also got very involved in the field of education.\n I did extracurricular educational offers in schools.\n You have to put that into context, that was the beginning of the 90s, there was all the unrest, all the violence, such as racism in everyday life.\n I have also been promoting educational programs in schools,\n at the teachers' and further education centers, at the teachers' and teachers' centers.\n And then I worked at a club at some point,\n which took up this topic.\n I have been working with educators for almost 15 years,\n I have been doing intercultural education,\n and also different topics in schools,\n with teachers, with many multipliers.\n And at some point I also engaged in the city council in Halle,\n as a volunteer for the SPD-Fraktion in the environmental committee\n and in the education committee.\n And yes, I was then mainly a volunteer for the education workers,\n then I changed to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the the state of Saxony as a representative.\n I was appointed there and from there I was elected for the German Bundestag in 1932.\n You said you joined the SPD.

That was all things that the SPD has passed through in this coalition.\n And I think that we have to make people clear. That was originally the question.\n We have to make people clear that we are doing politics for everyone.\n That means we are there to find solutions.\n We have made this clear in many, many places in the coalition agreement.\n For example, free education.

Yes, in Germany it is unfortunately still to be found that the success in the field of education is very dependent on the money of the parents.\n And my approach is that where I engage and get involved is that we succeed in the field of education to mobilize more investments.\n It can't just be about money, right?\n No, it's not just about money, it's also about staff.\n But it's not possible without money.\n If I talk about the school's renovation in all social areas,\n then I'm also talking about money to finance it.\n And we need tax money for that, which is also invested.\n And that's why we said that the surplus that we currently have in the field of finance,\n this surplus has to flow into investments,\n and we are doing that right now with 11 billion euros for this election period.\n But that's maybe a drop from a hot stone.\n We need more teachers and the countries alone cannot do that.\n And that's why this access to children from certain social classes can only be ensured if the conditions of access are the same everywhere.\n I am talking about BAf\u00f6G, which we have reformed and will reform.\n So that more young people have access.\n We have scholarships that are there, which may not be known to everyone and are called upon.\n There are also considerations to be optimized.\n We have free education, free access to education in the area of \u200b\u200bKita, school, university and education.\n If we implement this now, it is also a contribution to the justice of chance.\n Because if someone in the area of the kindergarten no longer pays money,\n what is left can be used elsewhere by the family.\n In this respect, I think that the lifting of the cooperation ban,\n i.e. the ban on cooperation between the federal government and the state, is a contribution.\n Free of cost is a contribution. More teachers is a contribution.\n And by the way, I also think that more teachers in the immigration background is also a contribution.\n Because in Germany we know that the classrooms are usually very colorful, but the teachers' rooms are not.\n In this respect, I think that in a population of 23% of people with immigration history, it is already too much to think about how the intercultural opening can also take a step in the area of school.\n And of course we are trying to do that within the SPD.\n We need more teachers. How can you make the payment more attractive.\n That is important, but I think the problem is somewhere else.\n The teaching profession as such, I know many teachers in my environment,\n I know that it needs to be even more valuable.\n The quality of being a teacher has to be upgraded.\n Education is not the only thing,\n the social position of the teacher.\n I mean, if we have school social work,\n which I call school social work,\n if we have full-time schools,\n that the teacher is relieved of other tasks,\n then many more people will be engaged\n in the area of teaching.\n And if we succeed in discussing all these topics in the International Council of Education,\n it cannot be that if I have federal states that employ teachers,\n that they are more attractive to go there.\n I train teachers in Sachsen-Anhalt.\n If they are not employed, they go to Bavaria and are employed.\n There are inequalities that lead to theavaria and they are The issue of the definitive lifting of the cooperation ban is a very difficult issue with the CDU and CSU.\n But we are talking about discussing the whole thing in a cooperative way with the countries.\n The CDU and CSU have moved on, by the way.\n Our demand is not new, that the federal government is also engaged in education permanently.\n This is not new."

I have a new guest. You've never been here before. Who are you?\n My name is Clemens Fuest. I'm the president of the IFO Institute.\n What is the IFO Institute? The Info Institute is an economic research institute that does research on economic and political issues,\n that promotes young scientists, that does political consultations, that brings research results to the public and does service, as we say.\n That means we prepare data, for example we do company surveys and then prepare the data for the public.\n But aren't there enough institutes? Why is all this important? Why do we need you?\n It's a good question. The IFO Institute is special, among other things, because we do company surveys that no one else does. We ask 10,000 companies every month how their current business situation is and what they expect for the next six months.\n This is important because we would like to know how the economy is doing in this situation.\n It is very important when 10,000 companies say what they expect for the next six months. And because of this broad basis, because so many companies are\n involved, the IFO index is the most important conjucting indicator in Germany, maybe even in Europe.\n And that is important because politics wants to understand in which direction the conjuction is going.\n And many who are otherwise involved in the business world are interested in it.\n The data can also be used to understand other questions, for example, how a business tax change affects the behavior of companies, the investment behavior of companies.\n We are currently studying this.\n For example, you can show, if a municipality increases its business tax, how companies change their investment plans.\n Do they revise them or not? Or how do companies react to certain events in their expectations?\n These expectations are important because they may then change their investment plans afterwards, decide on a position, etc.\n Are the companies always honest when they are asked?\n Because I can imagine that if a municipality increases its business tax, then they are of course always against it.\n Yes, they are always against it, but we don't ask the companies whether they are for or against\n an increase in business tax, but we always ask them, what are your investment plans?\n Have you decided to invest more now or have you revised it down?\n We always ask that and in the background everything possible happens and when the companies answer,\n they usually\n don't know what we will measure with it later. The main purpose is not to see how\n changes in your municipality affect your expectations, but the main purpose is how they develop\n in general and how changes in the economic environment affect your expectations.\n So I think that they actually give that very accurately.\n You can also see that the expectations, as we say,\n have a pretty strong power of expression for the course of the economy.\n And if the companies always say the wrong thing, then that wouldn't be the case.\n At least on average they already say what's going on.\n If you now say you're asking 10,000 companies,\n the question arises, why not 100? Why not all?\n We would love to ask all of them. We actually want as many as possible, because we want to have a complete understanding of the German economy.\n But to bring the companies to answer questions, we ask quite a few questions, that's not that easy.\n We write them down and say, here, take part.\n We have to offer them something.\n What do they get for it?\n We tell them, you get the evaluation for your industry.\n If you take part, you get an extra evaluation from us, for example, about your industry.\n Then you know how the conduct in your industry is.\n The others who don't take part don't get it.\n Exactly, the others who don't participate don't get it? Exactly, the others who don't participate don't get it.\n So the index, the results are in the newspaper,\n but not the industry results.\n And that's how companies tried to\n get people to participate."

One of its unique contributions is its monthly company surveys, where it asks 10,000 companies about their current business situation and expectations for the next six months. The IFO index derived from these surveys is the most important conjunctural indicator in Germany and possibly Europe, as it provides valuable insights into the overall direction of the economy. The broad basis of data from so many companies allows for a comprehensive understanding of economic trends and how they may be influenced by various factors, such as changes in business taxes or economic events. The expectations of companies are also significant because they can influence investment plans and other business decisions, making them an important indicator of future economic trends. The companies' responses are believed to be accurate, as they are not asked about their opinions on specific policies but rather about their investment plans and expectations. The IFO Institute's role is to provide this valuable data and analysis to policymakers, businesses, and the public, helping to inform decision-making and promote economic understanding.",

They have completely different interests.\n And here and there they are also aligned. No, not at all. They have completely different interests.\n Here and there they are also aligned.

So from the beginning you actually set up these company surveys\n because you had the idea from the beginning, okay, if we want to know how the economy is doing,\n how the economy is working, then we have to know what's happening in the company.\n Your predecessor was Hans Werner Sinn, right?\n Mm-hmm.\n Is the business running differently now than under him?\n Yes, that's necessarily the case. Not just because I'm here now, that's one reason.\n So every person is different, but because times are changing too. Yes, that is necessarily the case. Not only because I am here now, that is one reason.\n Every person is different, but because times are changing.\n That's why new topics are coming up, new demands are coming up, science is working differently and that's why things like that are changing.\n Give me examples.

That means two things.\n One, we work with data with which economic research has worked less before,\n for example data from companies, telephone companies or credit card providers,\n transaction data from banks. In this data you can see certain developments in other ways than in data of official statistics, let's say. For example, you can see certain developments in other ways than in the data of official statistics.\n For example, on telephone data you can look at how actually pedestrians move in a city and out of the city.\n We did a study with it about a road use fee in Munich to get rid of the traffic jams.\n We examined such a city mouth. Then of course you have to\n know how vendors move. But there is no official statistics on this. So we have\n taken the telephone data, of course anonymized everything and used it. Or we work\n with payment service providers to understand how it was actually in the corona crisis,\n where did the people buy in. And what you see, it's not surprising, is that the exports have been stored from the city centers to the periphery. It's called the donut effect.\n So, so to speak, the people, of course, when we were in the home office, we went to the pizzeria around the corner\n or something else. And you can only see that in this kind of data. And in order to do this\n research, you have to work with companies, you have to bring the companies to\n give the data. And that's one thing. The other thing is, you have to work with companies, you have to bring the company to give the data.\n And that's one thing. The other thing is that you have to use different methods,\n because these are very, very large data sets. You have to go differently, you need\n different training, different equipment. There are different legal questions. Data protection\n must be strictly respected. So these are just two examples of things that have changed.\n Is there still such a potato market department?\n Hans-Werner Senette likes to talk about the potato market and explain the economy to us.\n Yes, sometimes it is helpful to take relatively simple examples.\n This potato market is always ridiculed.\n Yes, it's okay. It's also a matter of taste, how you represent things.\n But sometimes it's easy to take the market for cabbage or potatoes or something like that\n just to explain something. Or to explain to everyone, even to non-specialists,\n how certain things work. Everyone does that differently.\n IFO is in Munich, right? Why not Munich?\n Yes, why Munich? Well, after the Second World War, quite a few new foundations took place.\n And at various points one thought about where it would be good to found economic research institutes. And the IFO has its roots in the Bavarian State Office for Statistics.\n We no longer had the big center, Berlin, and so institutes have developed in different regions.\n And the IFO has developed in Munich.\n How do you finance yourselves? Where does the money come from? We are members of the Leibniz Community and that means that from our basic equipment,\n that is about 60% to 70% of our funds, depending on how you count,\n comes every half of the country and federal government, so the Free State of Bavaria and federal government.\n We get the money and are evaluated every seven years by the Leibniz community.\n There is a commission of independent scientists who look at what the IFO Institute does,\n how the scientific performance is, how it works with the funding of young scientists?\n What about gender balance?

That is something different than if the Minister of Finance could take over\n and say, hello IFO, take care of it, otherwise you will not be financed.\n I think most of the ministers of finance would not do that.\n But that they can't do it is nice.\n Otherwise I wouldn't do this job either.\n Is it 100% from tax?\n No, that is our basic financing. Then there are third parties. So we take research orders from the European Commission, from the\n federal ministries, from state ministries, from foundations, from the DFG, i.e. from\n research and funding organizations. And our strategy is that we want to finance ourselves as broadly as possible so that we are independent of anyone.\n And sometimes such funds are also quality certificates. For example, if you have funds from the German Research Community, you don't get them easily if you're not really good at science.\n So you should have funds from the German Research Community. But we also do surveys for associations, for all kinds of associations.\n All kinds of associations?\n So we have to find out that this is a reasonable question.\n Give me an example where you say, for this association we are not doing anything.\n Yes, I don't know whether you would exclude certain associations or certain branches.\n There are certain branches that are in a slant. For example the cigarette industry, many say no to what we have nothing to do with.\n I can't remember that the cigarette industry would have approached us. I wouldn't exclude it right away, but of course you would ask about it. Or in the image coal industry or something.\n Yes, or coal industry, for example, I wouldn't have a problem making a report for them now.\n However, important, we also tell all the people who come to us, our research is always\n result-based. So we don't make reports that are already clear beforehand what should come out.\n And we publish everything. You can't come to us and say, okay, make a report, but that may then disappear\n in a drawer. This is also an agreement in the Leibniz community,\n under the Leibniz Institutes.

Or one thesis would be that if we lower the gas tax,\n then the price will decrease by less than the gas tax reduction.\n That would be a thesis.\n And there are studies that say, right, 30% flow into the pockets of the mineral oil companies.\n And because you test such things, because they are hypotheses that can be falsified, I would say that this is a science.\n There are also scientists, but scientists don't do that. There are other definitions of science. So, it's actually a science of the mind, we know it's sociology, it observes the society, the market, the economic situation and explains afterwards what happened.\n Well, slowly.

I mean, there are always demands from students these days that the economics study should be more pluralistic. There are different schools. Yes, I always try to understand what that is exactly. Maybe that's why you need it, I don't know.\n I think that means that you shouldn't just learn what we now call mainstream theory,\n similar to medicine. Some say, okay, there is school medicine, but there is also homeopathy and mental health and so on.\n But the VWL usually teaches neoclassical neoclassics, if you put it that way.\n Yes, that's I think...\n There are other schools of thought.\n Yes, the question is again, what is neoclassics?\n So very strongly Keynesian economic theory is taught in Makro, for example, not only neoclassics.\n Neoclassics already takes up a central space, but the question is where do you start?\n I think to understand economic theory it is important and good to actually start with the mainstream.\n This probably applies to many fields, but that cannot be the end.\n That is the beginning.\n Exactly.\n That is the beginning, that cannot be the end,, but I don't know an economist who believes honestly or who works like that.\n Maybe the center of neoclassical theory is the market model with offers and requests.\n There are offers and requests and where they meet, the price is formed and if something changes in the world, the price immediately adapts and the markets\n function. I don't think an economist believes that the world looks like that. The good thing is,\n I think it was Karl Christian von Weizs\u00e4cker who once wrote in a book that his father,\n who was a physicist, once asked him, say, why don't economists always make models?\n And then Karl Christian von Weizs\u00e4cker said, he answered, to understand why they are wrong.\n And it's similar with the neoclassics.\n So there is also now in relation to economic policy, so not only to understand how the economy works, but how to evaluate it all.\n There is the neoclassics, the first main principle of welfare theory, which says that every competitive balance is a welfare optimum.\n That means the markets lead to an optimal state.\n That is one of the foundations of modern welfare economics. But that is not the end,\n but that is the beginning of thinking about it. You think about it, under what circumstances is that wrong?\n And then you come to the theory of market failure, with which you spend most of your time.\n Then you say, okay, if there are externalities, that is, if the individual company maximizes its profits,\n or the individual actor can now harm others without being taken into account, then the market does not work.\n Then this profit maximization does not lead to the optimum and then one of the prerequisites of this main sentence is lost.\n But that's why this main sentence is so important, because you have to know, if you want to understand why it doesn't always apply,\n then you know where to look, namely for these prerequisites.\n And you also know where you don't have to look for things that don't belong to these prerequisites.\n I'm just wondering if there are other sciences that don't always apply.\n Or is that only in economics?\n I think that applies to almost all sciences, in every science,\n that statements depend on conditions.\n On boundary conditions.\n So also in physics, when you say, okay, if I\n change certain things in the environment of an object, say,\n if I supply electricity and look at a body that is warming, in the form of electricity supply, then of course it only applies under certain conditions."

These are also economic problems, but they are different.\n And because these problems that they have are no longer so existential, they don't have to be as hard as people today.\n And he says, the economists will no longer be so important. He says, the economic problems are being relativized. And if we look at the world today, we have to say that in our countries it has partly taken place.\n A minority, if at all, is fighting for mere existence.\n If we think about our everyday life, most of us have no worries whether we have something to eat tomorrow or have a roof over our heads.\n Good, we are one of the richest countries in the world.\n Exactly. Most of world. Exactly.\n A billion people would see that.\n Exactly, but in all of Europe and the USA,\n so in a large part of the world, it is like that.\n That is at least for a part of the world\n what he said.\n I thought it was a visionary article.\n And yes, that's also Keynes.\n He was very...\n At the beginning of the 30s, people worked 55 hours a week, I remember.\n Today, I'd say, still 40.\n I don't think that was foreseen, either.\n That we still work that much.\n He doesn't say how long he imagines working hours, but he does say that life is not so shaped by work.\n And that's one of the developments.

We only work 40 hours, not even 55. That's still a lot, of course.\n And he talks a lot about the fact that the economic problem is one of them is to fill our days with meaning.\n And for many people, work is much more than a bread purchase today.\n We talk a lot about young people today looking for meaningful work,\n maybe not necessarily one that is paid a lot or where you don't get jobless, like me,\n but that you want to do something meaningful or that you want to make yourself real.\n And that is of course not the fight for existence that shaped the working life and the economic life in the 1930s.\n How far are we from the 20-hour week, for example?\n Well, there are people today who think it's reality, who only work half-day.\n But for everyone?\n The fewest. Yes, I'm not so sure if we can get there.\n To be honest, we have a wide spectrum today.\n There are a lot of people who still work 55 hours a week, not because they have to, but because they want to.\n That means our work is, I think, now going beyond self-realization for many people.\n It is what Keynes described.\n I think many people work a lot, although they shouldn't, but could work much less.\n Then there are certainly more people who already have to work the 40 hours,\n because they just don't get around anymore. And I'm afraid that will still be a certain time\n to stay. So I can't see there will still be a certain time to stay.\n So I can't see the 20-hour week right now.\n But that could be the goal.\n So social progress, that you only work half the time with the same salary.\n Yes, I think the goal should be that people have the freedom to work 20 hours if they want.\n But people don't have the freedom to work 80 hours a week.\n There are working hours.\n If you are self-employed, you can work 80 hours a week. No problem. Could be. I don't want to, but most people can do that.\n Or many people can do that. You can also have a second job and so on.\n I mean, you shouldn't tell people how much work they have to work. But of course we also wish for a world in which productivity is so high\n that you don't have to work 80 hours for your life. And it would be nice if you didn't have to work 40\n hours, but only 30. You might be able to do that today, but in the end,\n decisions about working hours are also decisions about consumer wishes. And whoever has the desire to consume more and\n maybe not so much interest in leisure, works more. But self-determined, that's the important thing.\n Could I come to the ifo institute and say, Clemens, calculate or look at how we\n come to a 20-hour week for the general population?\n Yes, you can definitely do that. Whether we then calculate is a second question,\n whether we want to and whether we find it interesting.\n That would always be something interesting.\n Yes, how interesting would this question really be? So what would happen if we all worked 20 hours a week?\n It would probably turn out that we don't have enough staff in the hospitals anymore. The question is who\n offers all the things that we then have, that we want to have.

Capitalism is an economy in which capital accumulation plays a role.\n And market economy can be done without capital accumulation.\n In the lecture, the example that is always taken is that of a prison camp.\n Everyone gets a ration of bread and cigarettes a day and they can then exchange.\n It is a exchange economy, but an economy without production.\n It is a market economy, but not a capitalist economy.\n That's capital accumulation. You're very naive. No foreign currency.\n Yes, exactly. Capital accumulation is that you save and, for example, do not consume money,\n but decide to buy a machine.\n And then you have capital, this machine is there, it is still there tomorrow,\n with it you can produce something and with it you can generate goods.\n So you use resources today to generate goods at a later time. That's capital.\n Why does the capitalist do that?\n Why do you do that? The capitalist does that to make profits, the economist would say,\n to produce things and later to be able to sell them. And you do it mainly because the productivity\n increases, because we don't have to work so hard. The best example is the mechanization of agriculture. For centuries, people worked mostly in agriculture.\n You had to stand in the field all day long and work hard to mow the corn and to feed yourself. work. And today you take a tractor, that's capital. A farmer who has a tractor,\n that's a capitalist in the sense that someone is the one who uses capital and\n today he is doing what hundreds of people used to have to do with hard work.

It would be challenging to maintain the current level of services with fewer working hours.\n2. Attraction of certain professions: While some professions might be more attractive due to reduced working hours, it would not be enough to maintain the current workforce in various industries.\n3. Economic implications: A 20-hour work week would require significant adjustments to the economy, leading to fewer hospitals, schools, and other essential services. It would also mean fewer people working in factories, chemical industries, and other sectors, leading to a potential labor shortage.\n4.

And that is the\n great strength of capital use, not of capitalism, but of capital use, that one creates prosperity.\n Do you see yourself as a representative of market economy or capitalism?\n I see myself as a student of market economy and capitalism. I am interested in how the whole thing works. In addition, I am convinced that if we ask ourselves what creates prosperity and freedom,\n then I say that it is generated by market economy and capitalism.\n However, capitalism and market economy not in any form, but under certain conditions, as I mentioned earlier.\n For example, that competition prevails. In a monopoly, in monopoly capitalism,\n you still live better than in no capitalism. But it's better. So capitalism,\n market economy must go together, especially with competition. That is important.\n Is capitalism the ultimate plus ultra for a society?\n Yes, capitalism has many weaknesses, just like democracy, but it is the best form of economy we know.\n And the one that generates the greatest prosperity for the largest number of people.\n And in this respect it is the non plus ultra.\n Did you have anything to do with ecology in your studies?\n Well, with ecology...\n That you are explained how our economies destroy the planet.\n The economists would say with externalities.\n That's the topic of ecology and environmental destruction.\n This is a central topic in the study.\n If you can use resources without paying for something,\n if you can raise other costs and you do not include them in your calculation yourself, then there is a problem.\n And that is a central issue.\n In the welfare economy, I just described it, you start with this main sentence,\n yes, market economy will lead to the best results, provided there are no externalities.\n Yes, what if there are externalities now?\n Yes, then you need regulation, then there are different possibilities, regulation, taxes, bans, bans.\n You have to organize the whole thing in such a way that this overuse of this robbery doesn't work.\n And there are then various classic examples that are already being discussed in the study.\n It starts with the tragedy of the Almende, that comes from the Middle Ages. There was the idea that the forest and field belong to everyone.\n And that led to a destruction of the world. Because if something belongs to everyone, then it comes to overuse.\n So the individual uses these alments, drives his cattle on it until it's possible, before the neighbor drives his cattle on the meadow and best of all cuts off the forest immediately away because the neighbor will cut it off tomorrow.\n And that leads to natural destruction and then the market economy comes in again.\n If you privatize the forest and if you privatize the meadow, then the problem is solved.\n That doesn't solve every problem, but the problem is solved.\n I ask this because today there was a report in the Tagesschau that our Ministry of the Environment wants to create a plan for the circular economy. What do you think about that?\n Yes, as always, it depends on how you do it. So circular economy is good insofar as we have the garbage problem, we have the problem of plastic pollution of the sea. And I think that's a classic example of this tragedy of the\n almanac now only transferred to the oceans. So we destroy our life's foundations when\n everyone throws their plastic bottles into the river. And this microplastic is what you find\n in all kinds of fish today. It is a huge environmental problem and circular economy is the goal to prevent it.\n To be able to collect these substances, recycle them.\n We know it from paper.\n I think it's particularly serious in this example. that there is actually pollution of the sea and it penetrates all living things and makes us sick."

Is that right? Yes, that's not very precisely formulated.\n What does that mean? The consumption changes.\n That's right. We shouldn't throw our plastic bottles into the garbage\n and we shouldn't throw the stuff into the rivers,\n as it happens in many countries in a large scale.\n If we keep doing that, it will go wrong.\n So if we change consumption, it means that we...\n Less consumption, you mean, right?\n Yes, I think we have to collect the plastic bottles first. So we don't need less consumption for that.\n We can drink the coke bottle five times empty, we can't throw it into the water.\n Robert, your capitalism has not yet managed to solve the garbage problem.\n Yes, because you let people dump garbage fall into the rivers.\n Yes, but I think the market should solve that then, right?\n No, the prediction of the economic theory is that the market does not solve exactly that.\n If we have an al-menda problem, if we have an important resource that belongs to no one,\n that no one protects, that is used by everyone without any notice.\n But the company that produces the waste, the waste then belongs to the company.\n No, the waste does not belong to the company. If I buy a coke bottle, it belongs to me.\n Then you are responsible for the waste.\n Yes, exactly. Then you might be responsible for the garbage as a person.\n But we have the experience that not all, but many people are, that they do not take costs that they\n increase others as important as costs that they themselves have to bear.\n And that's why we say, for example, the first step was the introduction of the\n garbage bottle, but it was not a market solution, but it was often prescribed that\n one said, okay, garbage have to use plastic bottles.\n If you say, okay, if I throw the bottle in the trash now, then I lose 50 cents,\n then I already have costs. Then more people will be worried that bottles will be reused.\n And with plastic it is just the case that the waste disposal in this case has to be organized in such a way\n that plastic bottles are not simply thrown away, but that they are recycled. That systems are organized in such a way.\n Ultimately, it is the same as prohibiting the introduction of pollutants into the air,\n that the environment is in other ways under stress.\n That is actually an old topic and that is an area in which one needs state regulation.\n It's not just about the individual who has a coke bottle,\n but also companies or producers who destroy the environment.\n It's the same problem.\n It's their garbage that we're picking up.\n Yes, or it's their environmental pollution and their environmental pollution.\n And that's the role of the state. There are laws for that, the emission protection law and so on,\n that ensure that this does not happen anymore.\n So the state is currently still failing, the states.\n Because that still happens.\n Exactly, but many environmental problems have been addressed.\n The environmental conditions have improved in many respects,\n but many very big environmental problems, and especially global problems, are unsolved.\n And with the global problems, the difficulty is that the individual country has relatively little incentive to do something.\n Because it's the same again. If the individual country prevents plastic bottles from being thrown into the sea,\n then the individual country has relatively little of it if everyone else continues.\n That means you have to either agree on it or you have to come to an agreement with each country or better, you have to come to a joint agreement that this will not continue."

Problems like CO2 emissions, species protection, plastic, waste in the oceans,\n these are the biggest environmental problems, because the more actors involved,\n the more difficult it is to find an agreement.\n Is a circular economy combined with capitalism?\n Yes, definitely.\n So it is already a reality today that many things are being recycled.\n It has nothing to do with capitalism or not capitalism, but it is a question of how to organize capitalism.\n You can imagine that you have a social order in which there is no protection of property, but others can steal something.\n You also need a state that prevents this, because otherwise there is disturbance.\n And it is the same here. You need environmental laws, up to the environmental laws, environmental protection laws can accept this form,\n that you prescribe a circular economy recycling in certain areas, then it works.\n Back to the studies, did you learn why we have to grow? Why does economic growth need it?\n Yes, we didn't really deal with it that much in the studies.\n That's one of the laws of capitalism. No, that's not a law of capitalism, that you have to grow.\n But growth scepticism has begun in the broad mass with these Club of Rome reports in the 70s.\n Capitalism doesn't need growth, capitalism also works without growth.\n You can imagine an economy in which you only receive the capital stock and nothing else develops.\n The wealth does not increase, the production does not increase, it just stays the same.\n It is theoretically possible.\n However, we make the experience that the economy has been growing since the industrial revolution, the economy is growing. In this respect, we have capitalism here at the moment, which is connected to ongoing growth.\n But growth can have different sources. It can result from capital accumulation, it can arise through population growth,\n and it is created today, especially by the growth of knowledge. Capitalism goes without growth.\n There is this idea that capitalism would necessarily need growth, but that is a misunderstanding.\n Capitalism theoretically goes without growth.\n Marx had no right to do that.\n Without growth.\n Good.\n You just said that we grow from industrialization.\n At the same time we are spoiling the grow from industrialization, at the same time we destroy the planet from industrialization.\n So it is clear that economic growth and the destruction of the planet go hand in hand.\n Isabel Schnabel said recently that eternal growth is still possible. Does that look like that?\n Yes, I see it that way.\n On a limited planet. Exactly, on a limited planet. Many people claim that permanent growth is not possible.\n The mistake in thinking is to believe that growth is directly dependent on finite resources.\n But that is not the case.\n The most important factor in growth today is knowledge.\n Knowledge, human creativity, has no limits as far as we can see it today.\n We see, for example, that if we look at the CO2 emissions, that in Germany the CO2 emissions\n per unit of gross domestic product has halved since 1990. So the economy has\n grown more and more and per unit of economic growth the CO2 emissions have halved.\n The energy efficiency has improved.\n Yes, exactly. Energy efficiency has improved.\n You also know the rebound effect.\n Yes, but the rebound effect would say that the CO2 emissions are increasing.\n But it hasn't increased.\n Worldwide already.\n Yes, worldwide already, but not in Germany.\n That simply shows that Germany has grown without ...\n But you can't just think about the not in Germany.

Environmental laws and regulations play a crucial role in implementing a circular economy, as they provide the framework for recycling and reducing emissions.\nThe speaker also mentions that growth is not a requirement of capitalism and that the economy can function without it.

It is possible.\n Now the question is how universal this is and the other question is whether this is enough.\n Does the CO2 emissions go down fast enough to prevent certain consequences, but it is simply an empirical fact that an economy can grow without\n constantly emitting CO2 or without emitting other pollutants. Economic growth\n depends above all on knowledge and of course that doesn't mean that if we continue like this\n with this earth that it won't go wrong anyway. Of course, knowledge is necessary for economic growth,\n but we are still making the experience that yes,\n so far the CO2 emissions and other environmental\n burdens have still been taken over with increasing\n worldwide output.\n We are currently consuming three earths per year.\n Yes, I don't know exactly what three earths per year is.\n The burden of the ecosystem, what the ecosystem can withstand.\n And we consume three earths.\n Earth Overshoot Day is every year and it's getting closer and closer.\n We only have one earth, so after a third of the year the world would end.\n That can't be meant.\n Probably it's meant that we consume three times as many resources as would be sustainable.\n So how permissible, how it grows. That's probably meant.\n You can say that.\n Yes, okay, I understand that. So we are currently not sustainable with our economy. That's for sure.\n So we've grown too big. not sustainable. That means we have to produce what we produce today with less environmental\n burden and less natural resources. No, I don't know.\n But that's when we want to be climate neutral, which we all have to be,\n then you can only do economic growth without climate pollution. Exactly. There are renewable resources and non-renewable ones.\n With CO2 we have to permanently come to climate neutrality, otherwise the temperature will continue to rise.\n Now you can say, well, then it will continue to rise, that's just the way it is.\n But if we have the idea to stop climate change, then we have to go from CO2 to zero.\n And there are good reasons to say that you can do that. It will sometimes also, so we may not always have to, the question is what does climate neutrality mean?\n CO2 is absorbed here. And you can also sequester CO2 and so on.\n That means you can also get CO2 out of the atmosphere.\n So we have to get to a sustainable state there too.\n We can only blow so much into the atmosphere as we can get it out again.\n And that's a big challenge. So I don't want to talk too much about it.\n But this idea that it's a natural law that we're damned to go to the underground,\n or that we should stop growing and couldn't survive otherwise, I think that's wrong.\n In addition, you can't even classify that.\n Because growth is not something that any government thinks out and classifies, but we all with our actions ensure that there is growth or not.\n But because we all want to participate in medical progress, we all want to participate in culture, many of us want to go on vacation and so on. Through our consumption, through our wishes, we ensure that growth takes place. And if we don't pay attention,\n it leads to, if we organize it wrong, it leads to the temperature\n increasing more and more and more CO2 enters the atmosphere and so on."

We haven't stopped that nowadays.\n In some countries, yes. In Germany, I just said that.\n We managed to become a little more efficient.\n Yes, but the CO2 intensity has decreased. We agree on that.\n But we have to get to zero.\n Exactly, you just have to keep decreasing until you get to zero.\n But how is that supposed to work?\n Yes, the energy transition is exactly this project.\n So through the use of renewable energies,\n through the use of hydrogen and so on.\n I wanted to come to that right away.\n Yes, that's the idea.\n I'm not saying that this is not a challenge,\n but even if we, I'll say,\n reduce our consumption now, that would not solve the basic problem.\n That we, without blowing more CO2 into the atmosphere,\n we would not blow more into it than we take out,\n we would not solve the problem, but we would have to reach it at a lower level of consumption.\n And it is relatively easy to demand from a consumption level like in Germany that you should go down.\n That won't work either, but we have to see that there is still a rest of the world that has a much lower level of well-being.\n They will not play a part anyway.\n That's why it's so important that we solve things in a different way.\n But a lower level of well-being will help with the challenge, right?\n help with the challenge, right? No, that would only help if it really led to a resource-saving economy and it doesn't do that in terms of experience, but\n countries that have a lower level of prosperity, if we don't go back, I would say,\n to a subsistence economy, then it is the case that poorer countries, poorer areas,\n use more resources, which burden the environment more than countries with a higher level of well-being.\n This simply has to do with the fact that people have other priorities.\n If they have a higher well-being, then they pay more attention to the environment.\n I didn't quite understand it yet. You mean, whether we can get the consumption of fossil energy is open to get to zero and at the same time you say that there is eternal growth. How does that fit together?\n Growth depends on the growth of knowledge and human creativity. That is the real narrow-gauge factor and I don't think that's limited. When we talk about economic growth, we're not talking about knowledge growth, but about economic growth.\n The GDP doesn't calculate how much knowledge I've gained this week or this year.\n No, but the GDP is growing. It's a consequence of the accumulation of knowledge.\n We don't accumulate capital today, we accumulate knowledge.\n We can deal with digital technologies today.\n We have new solutions in medicine.\n This has nothing to do with resource consumption or with accumulation of capital primarily,\n but it has something to do with knowledge. How intelligently we use capital or resources.\n This has something to do with knowledge."

No, no, no No. That's good for the economy.\n No, I mean...\n Destruction is good for the economy.\n No, what you're describing says that BIP is not necessarily equal to the level of well-being that is achieved.\n Although if something breaks down, you have to repair it.\n If you repair it, you have a higher well-being than if you don't repair it.\n That's right.

The gross domestic product rises and the species protection improves because certain fish no longer die out and so on.\n That means you need resources for environmental protection.\n I think that to do this against each other leads to the fact that you can't get any further.\n So if you stand up and say you have to be poor so that you can't go on. If you stand up and say, you have to be poor\n so that we can save the earth,\n then most people will say,\n then I don't want to save the earth.\n You have to tell people,\n I'll show you how you can connect prosperity\n and a future for yourself with environmental protection.\n Then you can move on.\n Otherwise most people will decide\n to take care of themselves first.\n The more wealthy your country is, the better it is for the people?\n Overall yes.

Furthermore, reforestation can lead to the growth of various forest-dependent industries, such as tourism and forest-based manufacturing.\nFrom an environmental perspective, reforestation can help improve biodiversity by providing habitats for various plant and animal species. It can also help mitigate the effects of urbanization and land-use change, which can lead to the loss of natural habitats and the degradation of ecosystems.

That's just not true.\n Yes, that's true overall.\n That doesn't mean that if you move from a very high level to a higher one,\n that's not necessarily true, but overall it's true.\n You are also a advocate for privatization in our health system.\n There is also a nice example.\n The USA have a private health system. There is also a nice example. The USA have a private health system\n and Spain, for example, does not. The Spaniards spend $2,300 per head\n on health care and are 83.5 years old on average. The Americans are $10,000 per person\n and, as I said, are five years younger. I am not a supporter of the American health system.\n But you want more privat of the American health system.\n But you want more privatization in our health system.\n You could read that everywhere.\n I believe that privatization in the health system and the American health system are two different things.\n The American health systems are complicated.\n The American health system has the main mistake that not all people are health insured.\n But that has nothing to do with the question of whether it is now privately organized or not.\n Your argument should be that privately organized is better and more efficient, which obviously is not true.\n No, it's not that easy. Private organizations, in all the things I've written, I've always said that you have to organize a health system in such a way that all people have access to health care.\n But you can organize that in different ways."

Private organizations, in all the things I've written, I've always said that you have to organize a health system in such a way that all people have access to health care.\n But you can organize that in different ways. You can a basic standard of performance and say, okay, everyone is insured and now you have private providers that offer this health service.\n Or you have state hospitals, for example, or state medical practices that offer it.\n And for example, we have a very, very strongly privately organized health system from the provider's side.\n Most of the medical practices are privately profit-oriented.\n We have a steady health system, for example in NHS.\n Now you can think about which health system you would like to have.\n If people ask now, would you rather live in the UK in a state health system or in Germany?\n Why do you say the UK? We can also take Denmark or Sweden or Spain. Yes, or Denmark or Sweden. I don't know the systems there very well. I know the British system\n well. I don't think it's that bad. I don't think it's that bad. But you have to be clear,\n the question is what is privately organized in a health system. And I believe that the British\n health system is not optimal or does not working as I would imagine it would.\n Why? Because there is no provider competition. There must be competition among providers.\n In Germany we are a middleman between privately organized and publicly organized.\n Why should health be made a profit? Why should there be a market? Yes, because the market ensures that you pay attention to\n reasonably dealing with scarce resources.\n That doesn't happen in America. There is only a market.\n Yes, America has other problems. America also has the American health system\n has strengths. But it leads to the fact that you deal well with scarce resources and it also leads to the fact that you tend to do what the customers want.\n Now you have a special problem in the health system and that is that the markets only work partially.\n When you go to the doctor, the doctor usually determines what you need.\n You yourself just want to be healthy, but you don't know how to get healthy.\n The doctor determines his own demand.\n I tell the baker whether I want the bun or not.\n But the doctor tells me what product he is selling me and I have to trust the doctor.\n It's a different market and that leads to challenges.\n But that doesn't change the fact that you have to see that reasonable incentives are in place here\n and that resources have to be used as much as possible.\n Now, for example, in Germany it has been organized in such a way that you have to tell the hospitals,\n because resources were wasted, that one introduced fall-sales.\n That's just an example now. So that you react to incentives and you give the providers\n fall-sales when you say they have the right incentives, so halfway the right\n incentives to deal with the system reasonably. So I think the health care system\n is an area in which you can't get along so along with these partial categories that you like to operate with,\n private or state-owned, but these are all systems that are highly regulated\n and where you ensure that certain incentives are there or not by a certain market design.\n If I organize it like this, there is a case file, the doctor gets a certain payment.\n If he takes me in as a patient, then he will take me in rather than in a system in which he gets nothing.\n But in which he is an official.\n And there he sits, organized statically, and I am an official as a doctor, could organize me like that.\n And my salary is what it is, no matter how many patients I treat.\n That would be a typical state system that you like.

I think in many areas the question is not private or state-owned, but more how do you regulate it.\n I don't think this decision is private or state-owned.\n We see that with infrastructure supply.\n Today we have digital infrastructure, if you think about it.\n Today we have in many areas expansion of digital infrastructure through private, but with state regulation.\n And there is always the question of how does the whole thing work together?\n So what allows, for example, companies to take on a fee for network management?\n What access do various competitors have to these networks.\n It's not really about the question, is it state or private.\n Good example. We have private telecoms, Vodafone and so on, who are currently building the fiber optic networks.\n We are in the children's shoes. In Sweden, the state does it.\n In Stockholm, they have now managed to get 100% of all households to have gas.\n Exactly, I think it has nothing to do with private state, but with the question of how the approval process is running.\n If you now extend the approval process, if you ...\n That has nothing to do with whether Telekom can earn money with it in my village or not?\n And then decides?\n I don't think that has anything to do with it, at least not primarily.\n It's much more lucrative for Telekom to put it here in the big city, in the main street,\n where you know you have 2,000, 3,000 customers here than in a village where there are three customers.\n Yes, but that has also been recognized for a long time.\n Not by whom?\n Yes, but you can regulate that by saying, okay, if the state wants to have a line there,\n then it can, for example, increase that and say, okay, you offer a subsidy,\n then put the thing there for me.

So if we look at how we have organized energy changes so far\n or so in recent years, then one has said yes, a wind farm is to be built and now\n we are doing an escalation process and whoever wants the least subsidy will put the thing there.\n And that is basically the right procedure.\n The problem, the key factor is the planning procedure.\n And there you might even have to go more in the direction of market mechanisms.\n For example, if you say we want to set up wind turbines in a community,\n then you might have to offer the community that it gets compensation.\n If it doesn't get compensation, there is a huge resistance.\n Then the community says, why should we let the wind turbines be set up?\n I think you have to operate more with it, so that people are compensated.\n And then you say, okay, if you allow it, then you the money, it offers something.

So just a regulation that simply says no one is allowed to imitate CO2 anymore, that probably doesn't work.\n Because the question would be, if such a law were to come, how would you adjust to it?

And we want to\n get it done in a way that CO2 is first saved there, where the costs are higher here than in other areas and we want to get it economically so that CO2 is first saved where the costs are the lowest.\n And we can only do that if there is a price. Therefore, the CO2 price is so important.\n We are lucky in Europe that we have a CO2 emission certificate trading system\n and in principle limit quantities.\n Unfortunately, there are two important sectors, traffic and buildings, not yet included.\n But the goal should actually be to get these two sectors in.\n And then you would say, if you want to emit CO2 this year,\n then you pay 100 euros per unit, per ton of CO2 or whatever.\n And that's the market price for these certificates. And all companies,\n if you find that it only costs 80 euros to reduce CO2 in your company, then you reduce it.\n And then those who say, no, that costs me 150 euros to reduce it, they buy the certificates.\n And then the market ensures that CO2 is saved there, where it is the cheapest. And over time more and more certificates are taken from the market.\n That means the price of certificates is rising and CO2 is reduced in more and more places and in the end you are at zero.\n So you have to have a mechanism that works immediately.\n And just making regulations is not a good idea?\n I mean, we could also take another example,\n a fire extinguisher.\n That's a fire extinguisher ban.\n Exactly.\n That's also against it.\n That's not good, because\n if we have a certificate trade like that,\n then the price just rises.\n Why should I prescribe someone\n if they want a fire extinguisher or not?\n It's also superfluous. But you always say that these prices are a kind of motivation from the outside.\n You disturb people, it causes negative emotions, attitudes.\n What causes negative emotions?

A ban is not a motivation for something.\n I would see it differently. A price annoys me less than a ban.\n At a price I can say, okay, it will be expensive for me, but if I really need it, I can still do it.\n If I don't have a charging station nearby, I can buy another\n burner.

This approach allows companies to reduce CO2 emissions where it is economically feasible for them to do so, while those that find it more costly to reduce emissions can purchase certificates to cover their emissions. The price of certificates rises over time as more CO2 is reduced, incentivizing further reductions. Fuest also argues that a price is less disruptive and less likely to cause negative emotions compared to regulations, such as bans.",

But maybe there are people who can't do it or\n they just like to drive with the combustion engine. They like that. And why should you now\n dictatorially decide you can't do that if we can achieve the climate goals differently?\n Yes, but there is little to be done in traffic policy and that is where road traffic,\n individual mobility, is the problem. We have to get to zero. We can't sell 2040 burners if we want to be climate neutral.\n It all works by itself if we include road traffic in the CO2 trade. Certificate trade is indispensable, it works. Only if we don't do it,\n then we have a problem. Because the CO2 price is increasing more and more and the petrol price is getting\n more and more expensive. That's how it is. But that's not true either. In the last 30 years, the petrol price has\n increased more and more and we still have more and more oil consumption. Because the car traffic is not in the CO2\n certificate trade, that's exactly the mistake. Yes, but the price has still risen, even without CO2 tax.\n And yet the consumption is not so ...\n When does the consumption go down?\n I don't know when the consumption goes down, but probably relatively quickly,\n when it becomes significantly more expensive.\n We are now seeing, by the way, a good experiment now,\n so I dare, this is for households,\n that actually people drive less, if it becomes very expensive.\n And the price would rise relatively quickly.\n It is indisputable, the amount is given.\n But if I were to say to the young Clemens in 1990,\n that the petrol price is a quarter of what it costs today,\n and he would have said, today it costs this and that much,\n do you think we consume less oil or more?\n Then you would probably have said, well,\n purely economically less.\n And that's not the case. Again, that's just mandatory. If you have the certificates, you are not allowed to sell\n gasoline anymore. The price would rise very quickly.\n But the certificates only ensure that the price rises.\n No, the certificate amount is limited. So everyone who consumes one liter of gasoline\n needs a corresponding certificate. And since the amount is limited, the demand is definitely decreasing.\n The question is, how much is still driven by burners and how much is used in the industry,\n how much is used in households on CO2.\n That would shift.\n But that is the charm of the certificate trade.\n It guarantees that we achieve the climate goals, if we really keep up the trade of certificates.\n Do you think that the regulations, as you just mentioned, would strengthen our competitiveness?\n No, they weaken it, because they make climate protection more expensive than it really has to be. It gets more expensive.\n You want to do it more expensive with the CO2 tax. I want to ensure competition and innovation by the companies to think of something.\n Forget about innovation. Just now about the mechanism.\n We have to bring down the CO2 price, the CO2 emissions.\n And the certificate trading ensures that this happens where the costs are the lowest.\n And as a result, it is the way that guarantees the highest competitiveness.\n If we intervene with bans, then this means that we avoid CO2 where it is very expensive.\n We just go in with bans.\n I understand.\n Can't we do both?\n CO2 price, just as you want it, and still the prescription from 2045 is over with CO2 emissions.\n How do you get there?"

And that's what the certificate trade achieves, that we save where it is most affordable.\n What would it mean if Germany were the first industrial country in the world to be climate neutral?\n For our competitiveness.

So the question is, what is competitiveness? How should you do that? I'm trying to stay in your thoughts. Wouldn't that be the most blatant advantage of all time in terms of competition if we learned that in the first place?\n First of all, if I decide to use a resource that I can use, that others can use, not to use anymore.\n Let's imagine that we would say nobody works anymore.\n The resource is energy, we just replace it with clean energy. Yes, exactly, but we don't use the fossil energy anymore. We're giving it up.\n It's as if we would say, we won't use the two hours between 4 and 6 pm anymore.\n We don't like it, we shouldn't work on it. We're giving up on this resource.\n And all the others can use the two it. We are setting a limit.\n If everyone would set it up, then the environment would benefit.\n And then it would be nice.

By the way,\n like all other countries will understand that, okay, the Germans start in 2045,\n we a little later. They know exactly, okay, there is a German market and the world\n is oriented towards climate neutrality, then all companies will anticipate this and will direct appropriate research and development.\n Our companies will also direct themselves to this. It is often said that we have to become climate neutral because electric cars will soon and know that in China only electric cars are being asked on this market, then they build electric cars completely independent of what happens to us.\n But they don't have to be convinced if they know that this is the law.\n Yes, again.\n But why convince someone if you can make the that our market is not the decisive factor.\n It is decisive what happens in China.\n We already had a few CEOs in the show and they also said that innovation is created through regulations, through bans.\n That was the case in the 70s in Germany.

Of course not.\n Isn't the European market also crucial for China?\n Yes, it is also important.\n But for the German companies it is crucial, as far as their activities in China are concerned,\n their expectations about the Chinese legislation, not about ours.\n It has nothing to do with it.\n But wouldn't the German exports, which would then be climate neutral,\n also have a market advantage in China?\n No, they wouldn't be climate neutral if the German exporters didn't believe that these products are not being asked in China.\n Apart from that, the most is being produced for the Chinese produced in China.

Our resources are simply limited and we have to think about where we can put them.\n We could do it like this and say, we put in a lot of resources, but it doesn't come down to money.

And to do something about it, there are different suggestions.\n For example, here from the DEW in Berlin, rent shopping.\n So that you offer tenants to acquire their family, their property.\n People who may not get a boutique from the bank,\n that they can then acquire real estate through their rent.\n So to ensure more property in the wide.\n I think that's a good idea. You're against the wealth tax?\n What do you think of the White House's plan?\n There's currently a minimum wage tax for super rich people,\n a so-called billionaire minimum income tax.\n It's not about a wealth tax, it's about an income tax.\n You have to say that wealth wealth taxes, it's not a country...\n It's both. It's about households with an income of more than $100 million,\n who then have to pay at least 20% of their income.\n I'm not sure if that's really researched.\n The problem is...\n The Washington Post. I think they've done that quite well.\n Yes, so minimum income tax means that you...\n Yes, that's the title, but it works like this.\n You have to have at least 100 million dollars of wealth and then you have to pay at least 20% income tax.\n I don't think the tax is complicated between 2010 and 2018 super rich people like Elon Musk paid an average of 8.2% taxes on their income.\n And that's less than a teacher or a teacher.\n Yes, you have to be careful with these numbers. These people have companies in the USA.\n And the companies make profits and they are now paid to these people. But of course, taxes are paid on the corporate level.\n So to put it briefly, in the US tax system, the problem is not that there is no wealth tax,\n but that there are large gaps in income taxation.\n You should start with that.\n So you can in the USA relatively easily, if you count value increases,\n so I don't say you buy a company and sell it later,\n then you can do that without paying taxes.\n And so the problem of those who are screaming for an estate tax is that an estate tax is a new tax,\n it is not available in the USA, to implement something like that is incredibly difficult, the rich are running away.\n The problem actually leads to the fact that you have to pay the income tax first.\n The Americans can run anywhere they want, Clemens. The American state doesn't care. If you are an American citizen. You have to pay the income tax first. The Americans can go anywhere they want, Clemens.\n The American state doesn't care. If you are an American citizen, you have to pay taxes.\n You can also give up the citizenship and then you don't pay taxes anymore.\n Or you can organize it so that you don't pay them.\n They don't follow you around the world.\n Yes, but it's relatively easy. You can also give it to some vehicles.\n It's not worth it. They should first repair the income tax.\n That's much easier.\n If I raise an income tax that leaves big gaps, then I don't have to wonder if the income inequality increases.\n The intelligent step would be to repair the income tax. The problem is that you can't mobilize it so well politically.\n If you mess with the wealth tax, the blood pressure increases faster among people.\n But I'm afraid that politicians who demand something like this know that it won't happen because the practical problems are too big.\n What you have to do is look at the income tax and drive it in reasonably and stop gaps.\n You can collect a lot more. There is no state in the world that has an income tax as its main source of income.\n That's not possible. And that has to do with the fact that income taxes are cumbersome to raise.\n You have to evaluate the rest of the wealth. That leads to big problems.\n And really rich people can easily avoid the tax.\n And we all pay the income tax. Income taxation is well established.\n But there are huge gaps and you have to work on these gaps first."

If not with an asset tax or app store tax.\n I think we have to start with the income tax in all countries.\n Now in Germany.\n Exactly, in Germany too. In Germany we also have to start with the income tax. I don't want to redistribute the wealth, that's not my goal.\n I think it's a goal to open wide groups of people to access wealth. But to introduce a wealth tax would harm Germany, because those who have US wealth will then be deported.\n Would redistributing be harmful?\n We distribute a lot, that's part of the social market.\n But obviously not enough if the concentration of assets continues to increase.\n When it comes to redistributing, it depends a little on how you do it.\n If you want to redistribute, I have to control the ground and the soil more, but not introduce a net capital tax, because a lot of capital is mobile.\n You have to set up in the ground and the soil and the ground and the ground is not particularly highly controlled with us.\n I recently wrote a post about it with colleagues, in which I describe how to change the tax so that it is more fair.\n So an example, if you bought a rental house here in Berlin 10 years ago,\n then that is now maybe the double value.\n You can sell it again, you have earned a million, let's say.\n Do you know how high the income tax is that you pay for it?\n Tell me. Zero?\n Yes.\n So, nice. So that's our tax system. Why do we need an\n income tax if we have such gaps? We don't need that. We have to align our own tax,\n our income tax system in such a way that there is fair taxation. And I think if you want to\n introduce an income tax, I'm not a friend, but if you want to do that without causing greater\n economic damage, without capital flight, then you have to take\n real estate. Then we have to introduce a dual estate tax,\n then you have to tax the ground and soil more. You will be very much anger and bitterness\n on the body, but if you want to do that, if you want to redistribute assets,\n then you should take the real estate wealth, because it cannot deviate.\n You don't want to redistribute wealth at all. You have nothing against our wealth inequality.\n You have nothing against it if it gets even worse.\n I don't think that's our main problem, that we redistribute wealth now.\n Is that a problem? The concentration of wealth. I think that concentration of wealth will become a problem if it leads to high inequality of income.\n But that is not the case in Germany.\n We have to go back to income.\n Yes, it is about income. What do you have from it?\n 50% of the wealth is inherited. It doesn't matter what the income is.\n No, it doesn't matter what the income is. No, it doesn't matter at all. Let's take a person who lives in Munich, in a Rheinhaus.\n They have an income of one million, because the Rheinhaus costs one million.\n If someone lives in Kiel in a Rheinhaus, they have an income of 300,000.\n Most of the income is inherited by inheritance.\n No, just take this comparison.\n The income is important.

Then you can do something like that, like a butcher or a butcher, whatever,\n and you have the skills, great, then you can certainly do management tasks.\n But as a minister of justice, you simply have to have access to our law, to the system,\n also a bit of background knowledge.\n And which university?\n Erst in G\u00f6ttingen.\n That was back then, that was the beginning of the 70s,\n that was of course a huge university, it is still huge today, but since I'm from Westfalia, not too far away, but of course from home,\n I didn't live at home, thank God, that was also very important, my older sister was already there, so I went there quickly.\n And afterwards I studied and took an exam in Bielefeld, the university was was new.

The former Minister of Justice, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, played a significant role in these changes during her tenure in the cabinet with Angela Merkel. She was instrumental in addressing the legal gaps that emerged after the abolition of Paragraph 175. Despite the initial resistance from the Union, she worked with Merkel to pass laws that recognized same-sex partnerships and provided them with legal protections. During their time in office, they visited cities in eastern Germany to understand the situation and identify the need for new laws.

And there it was said, yes, if the Asian mafia groups or other mafioso structures or organized criminal structures meet in the apartments,\n so they always meet in private apartments, and then you can't stop there and then you can't act and then something can happen.\n And then you, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, are responsible for it when someone dies.\n That was the situation in the battle.\n It's a bit like the Trump thing, where Trump said to a judge,\n if a terrorist attack happens to us, it's your fault.\n Exactly. Then I was the Madam No or security risk.\n You were a security risk.\n I was a security risk in the eyes of some of the CSU,\n also in the ministerial offices in Bavaria.\n And this debate was there in society, but not so overwhelming.\n It was not comparable to the refugee debate 2015.\n But it was an issue.\n And of course, Mr. Kanter was then Minister of the Interior.\n You don't remember him that much today.\n But that was really the law and order man and wanted this profile.\n Is he comparable to Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re?\n I would say Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re is rational, thoughtful, everything.\n So not comparable.\n Really?\n No, he wasn't comparable to Kantor.\n He has a different understanding of the office.\n Kantor was irrational and not thoughtful. Kanter was very convinced.\n He said that what he wanted could only be the right thing.\n And that should be done.\n And he did it.\n And afterwards, you know, in the CDU,\n his career ended a bit sad.\n Because he had to give away all these explanations\n why there might be financial incorrect uses of money,\n then there were alleged liabilities and so on.\n So that was, and he still had to put himself in a procedure.\n But nobody thought of that at the time.\n In any case, my party friends, partly a group that said,\n we can't refuse it, we have to participate.\n We have to find a rule that allows it.\n Of course strictly legal, with control and everything.\n So, monitoring in-house.\n So-called run-ins.\n And I said, bingo, no, not with me.\n There is a limit exceeded.\n Which one?\n There is a limit exceeded, that according to my firm conviction, as the basic law also foresaw it at that time,\n in private rooms, not when I'm sitting in a pub or in my office or something,\n but in private rooms I have to have four walls, eight or ten walls, where I'm really just a private person, where I can live out myself,\n where the state does not secretly introduce a curfew,\n i.e."

She believed that the state should not secretly introduce a curfew into private spaces, and that individuals should have the right to live out themselves in their homes without constant surveillance. This debate put her at odds with some in the CSU and the Ministry of the Interior, who saw the need for such monitoring to combat organized crime. The debate was not as overwhelming as the refugee debate of 2015, but it was still an issue in society. As a result of her opposition, Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger was labeled a security risk by some, and her political career suffered. Her stance on this issue was not popular with all members of her party, and some believed that she had to participate and find a way to allow for monitoring while maintaining strict legal controls. Ultimately, the debate led to the implementation of so-called run-ins, or monitoring in private homes, but Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger refused to support this measure. The consequences of this debate were significant for her political career",

She was involved in creating targeted projects, such as meeting points for drug addicts, to provide them with sterile syringes and controlled disposal. She believed that this approach would reduce the annoyance for the police and allow them to focus on more important matters. She also mentioned that there were models like Vendi, which followed a similar approach. However, she did not support a full criminal law reform with the motto of everything being legalized. She acknowledged that the Greens wanted more, but she did not see Germany being ready for such a regulation at the time. She also mentioned that there was a big debate about the release of marijuana among young people during that period.",

In September 2014, the Houthis took the president and his cabinet into custody, and the president declared a retreat, which needed to be approved by the parliament according to the constitution. However, due to the young and naive nature of the Houthis, they did not gather the parliament to accept the retreat, leading to a power vacuum. The former president, who had the majority in parliament, fled to Aden, but the militias loyal to him and the Houthis, who saw him as a legitimate president until the parliament confirmed his resignation, became angry and formed militias, leading to the division of the government. The South Yemen, which was a separate state from North Yemen until 1990, became a significant factor in the power struggle as the militias sought to follow the president to",

There are already hundreds of people,\n there are no official numbers in the war, there are no numbers that are authentic.\n There are many civilians who have been injured, killed, and so on.\n We also have the concern that there will be a use of land at some point.

I have relatives who are Houthis, I have to introduce them to you.\n I also have some friends who are Houthis. The North of Yemen is very divided.\n You have probably heard of the Sun Sunnis and Shiites. In Yemen we also have this problem, but in the light version.\n For example in Iraq, in Lebanon, the Sunnis don't pray with the Shiites,\n and vice versa, they don't marry each other.\n You can see in the family, someone is Sunni and someone is Shiite.\n It's a unique, in Yemen.\n But still I have many friends, many people have been arrested by the police.\n Thank God I am not as important as these people.\n There have been tortures, people have been people who have already disappeared,\n and so on and so forth.\n Of course my family in Berlin is very worried,\n also very worried.\n And as I said,\n you would like to get out as soon as possible\n before it gets really dirty.\n That's understandable, but\n where is the army of Jem?\n There must be an army that fights against it.\n That's a very sad story.\n I forgot that there are an army.\n Oh oh.\n Yes.

What does it look?\n What does economic policy do in Europe?\n I have now read, we have once again saved the ass of a country.\n We want, we want.\n IWF, I read today, has saved Ukraine.\n How is that?\n Well, IWF plans to support Ukraine with a help loan.\n That means Ukraine gets money from the international cash register,\n which countries like Germany and all other countries in the world have also paid for.\n This money is lent to Ukraine as a loan,\n in the hope that Ukraine can continue to finance the business,\n can keep the state alive and then at some point,\n that is also part of the plan,\n if the country is healthy, this money with interest, as it always is, is repaid to the IMF.\n So we earn with money, like Greece?\n Yes, not directly, because it's not about our national banks, but the IMF.\n It's just IMF, not Troika?\n There are no Troika yet.\n Not yet?\n Not yet. It is also planned that other countries can contribute to this. The IMF gives 15-18 billion dollars, not euros.\n And then a few billion will be added.\n The USA, Japan.\n So that there should be 27 in total.\n Why does Ukraine need the money?\n Do they have such high debts? 200%?\n No, not at all.\n The debts are not the problem.\n The debts are actually relatively low, around 40%.\n Lower than in Germany.\n So half as much as Germany, roughly. Only the problem is that, like almost every country, what the state takes in is not enough to finance everything that is to be financed.\n Now also a little war, possibly.\n And the capital markets, the banks, do not lend the country any more money, because you don't know how it will go on.\n And that's why someone has to jump in and fill this gap.\n And in that case it is the EWF.\n But that has nothing to do with the fact that they want to go to Europe, EU,\n and maybe want to have the Euro. They have to have at least 60% of the state debt.\n Yes, the Euro. I don't even know if they want to have it.\n It would be totally crazy if they got the Euro. So, again, a problem case.\n It has something to do with it indirectly, because Ukraine is already the third program now.\n They have already asked for loans twice.\n Both times the program was cancelled because the deposits were not held.\n Actually, you didn't want to make any more money available, but now the West is so strongly engaged.\n When you say we support you, there is a momentum to say, well, then we have to let that cost us something.\n What conditions are being set there? You say 16, 18 million dollars are given there.\n Two years.\n What for? Is there a saying, we help you or we help you with conditions?\n Yes, as always with the IWF, there are conditions that are laid out,\n they are also fixed in the memorandum of understanding,\n so a loan contract, a loan agreement. And it includes structural reforms, labor market, legislation, corruption fight, transparency,\n it includes short-term cuts, it includes above all...\n Austerity or what?\n Yes, exactly.

You can't save the country.\n But Ukraine has a state deficit of about 10%.\n So the gap between a country and a state deficit...\n Somehow you have to make sure that you can't just live on pump for a long time.\n But you get there and then you're right, of course.\n You can try to shorten everything, then the economy goes worse,\n then you take in less and the hole gets bigger and bigger.\n That's why it comes down to the right balance.\n But that a country can't go on like it has been before,\n when it's just 10% in the weeds, I think that's also clear.

The IMF finances the Ukrainian government.\n The Ukrainian government has liabilities, has to match old bills. Whether this will come out of the pot exactly, you can't say at the end.\n But the fact is that Ukraine will possibly pay part of its bills to Russia, to Gazprom.\n And it can only do that because it gets money somewhere.\n And one source of money is of course the West.\n It's like if I ask my parents, I need a little money, they give me money money and I get a little more drugs. The interesting thing is that these IWF programs have to be decided by the IWF,\n an institution in Washington.\n Is that a democratic organization?\n No, the richest countries have the most voting rights,\n but there are 180 countries that are members and they decide who gets loans and who doesn't\n and under what conditions.\n Of course, Russia is also involved.\n And it will be exciting now, because this loan has to what conditions.

These conditions were likely a result of Ukraine's dependence on Russia for its energy needs and Russia's strategic interests in maintaining influence in the region.\nHowever, at some point, Russia decided to end these special conditions and demanded that Ukraine pay the global market price for natural gas. This led to tension between the two countries and was a factor in the Orange Revolution, which was in part driven by public opposition to the government's decision to raise natural gas prices.\nThe IMF's involvement in financing Ukraine's gas bills came about as a result of Ukraine's financial instability and its inability to pay its gas bills to Russia. The IMF provided loans to Ukraine to help it meet its financial obligations, including its gas bills to Russia. This meant that part of the money the IMF provided went to Russia to pay for natural gas.

The fear is that the aid might be used to save certain entities or individuals, such as oligarchs, who bought Ukrainian securities, banks, state loans, or other loans. These entities or individuals might have benefited from the aid, while the average citizens of Ukraine might not have seen any significant improvement in their living conditions. The interview also mentions the potential involvement of European and American banks in the country, which might also benefit from the aid. However, it is noted that the situation is complicated and requires careful consideration of who has where and what money. The interview also mentions the possibility of a state bankruptcy, which could lead to significant economic instability and potentially negative consequences for various entities and individuals.",

But if I eat too little carbohydrates,\n then the body says, I need replacement, I need something else.\n And then you often get a hot hunger and you simply put sweets in you.\n It's not a drug, but it's the effect of the change.\n Yvonne says, especially in Colorado, marijuana was legalized.\n Not only did the rate of violence and criminal statistics drop,\n the huge economy is also spilling masses of taxes into the household accounts.\n Do you see a change in Germany?\n We had a change in Germany, but only for the medical sector.\n Great for the economy, bad for the health.\n That's why there is no change in my view and the view of the federal government.\n And the very last one, it came by e-mail from Boris.\n Unlike in the other European countries,\n in Germany, advertising for cigarettes is still made publicly,\n although there has been a EU law for this for years.\n How can the tobacco lobby in Germany do without the laws?\n Why is there still advertising for tobacco that is considered a drug of entry?\n I think that's a great question, because last week I publicly demanded that the outside advertising, the poster advertising in the, Bulgaria hasn't done it yet, but we are the one, the other.\n We should be an example, we should finally implement this convention, which we have also signed.\n And this is also part of the poster advertising ban.\n And the question was a little bit, why does it take so long?\n The drug officer needs more hay within the federal government.\n And that's why I'm not saying anything publicly anymore.\n I'll say something again when I've reached the goal.\n Thank you, Marlene Mortler.

Game theory is an instrument to analyze strategic interaction.\n So if what I do, what I optimally do, is not only dependent on my environment in general, or what concerns me,\n but also what others in the market do, in other companies.\n So if what is optimal for me depends on what the other company does.\n As a monopolist I don't have to be afraid of that.\n I know that if I set the price, so many people will buy from me.\n But if I'm in a, yes, if I'm in complete competition,\n then I don't care because I know what price I can sell something at, I sell as much as\n is useful for me.

Do they\n now also come out with a new product now?\n Do they sell a lot now? Do they sell little now? Depending on the market price, it is very\n different and I want to behave differently myself. So to investigate that, you need\n game theory and that was totally exciting. So totally exciting for competition questions. And then\n you can also apply it to many things. And the next thing that came up was to think about how to design games.\n Now we come to contract theory.

How do I regulate sensibly?\n Do I privatize or do I leave companies state-owned?\n It's all a question of how I design a market.\n For this, contract theory plays an important role.\n And to analyze that, I need the game theory.\n So one led to another and there were different topics.\n As I said, there was a lot of competition at first.\n I was very busy with that at the beginning.\n And then there were also these questions about optimal\n organization of institutions, and then the wall fell.\n Then you thought about how markets were developed.\n What went wrong before?\n What do you have to do now to make\n flourishing markets develop?\n And all these questions played a huge role there.\n There was no market in the GDR?\n No, there was no market.\n I can always ask my parents, have often gone to the market.\n Yes, maybe they went to a market and bought vegetables there. But there was a planned economy.\n It was decided by a government how much and from what is produced.\n And that was either what the people wanted or not.\n A planned market or what?\n No, it was not a market in the sense that you said,\n oh, the people come, they want what we have,\n should I produce more of it?\n If that was not in the plan.

Is that fundamentally bad? The question is simply which system works in the sense that resources are used efficiently\n and for that it is important to find out what people want.\n And who makes the effort to find that out?

Additionally, game theory played a crucial role in contract theory and the design of markets. It helped economists understand how to design games, such as licensing markets, and regulate them effectively.

I think I should add at this point\n that I always talk about game theory and that may seem a bit alien to some.\n That should by no means mean that it is about playing.\n That is simply the expression that has been incorporated,\n because the first investigations into such strategic interactions\n actually existed on the subject of playing.\n So they just investigated chess.\n In fact, such social games, that's how it started,\n such things were investigated.\n It was then also applied to completely different areas.\n Warcraft, for example,\n is a strategic game.\n Who moves when?\n We could now think of an example\n from Putin,\n what kind of game is being played here.\n That was an application.\n And then it was later used as an instrument to analyze strategic interactions on markets.\n But that doesn't mean that markets are a game in the sense that funny games are played there.\n No, it's just the question of strategic interaction.\n Game theory is the instrument for that.\n J\u00fcrgen, game implicitly for me, there are winners and losers.\n No, that doesn't have to mean that.\n You would win a game.\n The market owners also want to win or produce wins.\n So there are zero-sum games and there are games that are not zero-sum games.\n In chess, it is actually like that.\n Either one can win or the other, or there is a remi.\n But market economy, economy is actually something where we can all win.\n So it's not like when the entrepreneur sells something, the buyer loses.\n In the most favorable case, both win.\n The entrepreneur earns something because he sold something that I like as a customer\n and I'm happy to get the product.\n So we both won something.\n So, economy doesn't mean zero-sum game, but actually we want to interact to create something, to create added value, to make everyone stand out better in the end.\n But if you say market economy means we can all win, that also means we can all lose.\n Yes, because we're doing the wrong thing, I'm sure.\n Shouldn't we eliminate the fact that we can lose or that we lose in\n community? Yes, by setting the right rules. So that you can only win.\n So that you definitely have incentives to behave in a way that you don't lose. Now we have to\n think about it, in what situation do we all losing now and why should we prevent that?\n So environmental damage, for example, that's exactly a situation where you actually have to be careful\n how you set the rules so that we don't lose, because that's a classic example\n where individual behavior is harmful, not only for me, so for me little,\n when I pollute the environment, I feel it myself, but in general everyone feels something.\n And if we all do that, we all lose.\n That means that this is exactly a situation where I need appropriate rules so that I can avoid the negative externalities,\n negative effects for the other generators, where I can avoid that as much as possible.\n But with the climate we are all losing now for decades. Exactly, because we are doing things that\n will actually harm us all in the long term. Then the market game there has no sense\n or it doesn't work. Of course, exactly, that's exactly the point.\n So if you think about when markets work well, then when I have a competition,\n when I don't have such externalities and when I don't have asymmetrical information.\n Micro, one, my lecture every autumn, that's exactly what it's about.\n We talk about the market and that it produces great results and then it says yes, but be careful."

It helps to understand the behavior of market participants and the potential outcomes of their actions.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that game theory does not imply that markets are a game in the sense of a fun or competitive activity.

Exactly, because we are doing things that\n will actually harm us all in the long term. Then the market game there has no sense\n or it doesn't work. Of course, exactly, that's exactly the point.\n So if you think about when markets work well, then when I have a competition,\n when I don't have such externalities and when I don't have asymmetrical information.\n Micro, one, my lecture every autumn, that's exactly what it's about.\n We talk about the market and that it produces great results and then it says yes, but be careful. What do I need for it and when does it not work?\n And these are exactly the three points.\n In the moment when I don't have a full competition,\n the market doesn't work well, I have to do something.\n In the moment when I have externalities.\n And there are positives and negatives.\n I'll just say that.\n And if I have asymmetrical information, I also have a problem.\n You with your foreign? Okay, I also have a problem. You and your stranger.\n Okay, okay, okay. Good. So, yes.\n Three after that.\n Positives and negatives.

Air pollution.\n Air pollution, exactly. So all emissions, if you will, that others find unpleasant,\n but which they have to suffer with, then I have a problem. Then I have to see how I can solve that.\n I also have positive externalities. For example, when I come up with something great,\n an innovation, another topic that I am very much concerned with. if I come up with something great, an innovation, another topic that I am very much concerned with,\n if I come up with something great, new,\n then I can use it, but then others also have something to do with it.\n If I pass on this information.\n If I pass on the patent.\n Yes, exactly.\n Now we can talk about why the patent still needs it,\n why it makes sense.\n But someone who invents a new song, they don't just sing it themselves.\n If it's really good, they sing it to others and they're happy about it.\n A positive externality.\n So that would be a case where the market doesn't work well.\n In one case because you do too much of something, too much pollution in the environment.\n In the other case because you do too little of something.\n People invent too little if they don't get compensation for it,\n so that the others also find it great and learn something from it.\n And that's where it needs to start again.\n That's why we subsidize innovations and research and development,\n universities. We subsidize that to give even more incentives to do that,\n because we have so much of it in total and the individual\n doesn't have so much of it for himself that he makes enough of it.\n Where does it need, in which social areas, no market? Where can't there be a game?\n I think with a lot of interpersonal interactions, I would think it's problematic\n if we think about a market. A market breaks relationships. Let's think.

So we should actually talk about why we want to have state-owned companies in some cases\n or want to have state violence in some cases.\n Or state-owned basic care.\n I don't see that we need a competition for the fire department now, that there are many efficiency gains. Well, there are probably, you can do it better or faster, but I don't think a competing fire department would be so good at this point.\n I think that was the idea. In every smaller, larger city there is a fire department and there was also a hospital.\n We have now partly privatized the hospitals.\n They are now also part of a competition and have to earn money and have to make profits.\n We can do that at the fire department too.\n If the fire department in the neighboring city is faster at the fire than the own, then it just sets itself through.

What is economy? That is the\n handling of scarce resources. And we as a society have to think about\n what we have in resources, we can only spend that once.\n So we can spend the money only once.

Monika points out that if the market were functioning efficiently, there would be a small hospital nearby for every community, even in areas with fewer residents. But the question is whether society is willing to pay for these hospitals and the associated costs. She suggests that the society must consider what it is willing to afford in terms of individual services and what it might have to cut back on to accommodate the additional costs.\n\nMonika also mentions that the society can increase its revenue side to pay for healthcare services.

This is a fiction by an actor who acts rationally and maximizes his benefits.\n Yes.\n Good.\n People like Hans Werner assume that we are all like that.\n I don't know if he assumes that.\n That's fiction at first.\n That's something you can work well with in models.\n And then there is the question of how far you can go with such models.\n I said two things.\n You work in models with fiction?\n Yes, there are many fictions.\n And a model doesn't need to be realistic at all points if it makes good predictions.\n We want to work with models and models are then useful or good if they make good predictions.\n That's what we're concerned with with the economy. We want to analyze topics and say what's going on in this situation,\n because we want to know what will happen if we now introduce a certain political measure,\n increase taxes, lower taxes, introduce interest rates, something like that.\n And then we want to say, what will change?\n So that means we want to understand as citizens how a certain market works,\n a certain situation, and what happens if we change something.\n We need or we like to work with models for this,\n if they help us to make this prediction good. In such models we like to work with the\n homo economicus. Now the two things again, rationally and maximizing profit.\n Rational, we'll get to that in a moment. Maximizing profit does not mean maximizing money,\n does not mean maximizing income or profit or anything else. In companies,\n typically, it is not a bad assumption,\n although they also make a lot of mistakes.\n They don't always maximize their profit, but at least that's their goal.\n For people, maximizing their money is not the right assumption.\n Maximize their benefits, yes.\n So maximizing money would also mean,\n I only think about my own profit or my own income, I don't care what happens around me.\n I work all the time.\n For many people it's not like they tick, but they may only work so much that they what my neighbor is doing, what my children are doing, what the environment is doing.\n Maximize use. I think the fewest people would say, no, I don't maximize my use.\n That would be... So use is ultimately tautological.\n So use is where I'm good at. There may be people who are masochistic and like to hurt themselves.\n But then they do it again because they have use for it.\n So you would think that's not the problem with the model.\n The problem with the model is probably rationality.\n Are people all so rational?\n What does reason mean?\n They are limited in that. On the one hand, because they have limited capacity to go through things,\n they don't have as much time as they want, to look at everything carefully.\n What are the best options? What is the best price, to make the decision reasonably.\n Even if you are overwhelmed by the situation,\n I want to look for an insurance,\n what is the best insurance, it is super complicated.\n Moving around on the Internet now, the situation is very complicated,\n it is also difficult for you, the companies do not help you.\n So that means that at this point many people do not behave this point. And that has to be taken into account.\n Nowadays, models are being used to make behavioral economic considerations."

And that has to be taken into account.\n Nowadays, models are being used to make behavioral economic considerations.\n And the important thing now is to understand exactly in which situations I have to take this into account,\n that people don't necessarily behave so rationally, that they, for example,\n don't think about the future, have preferences, where they say today, tomorrow I'll start,\n I'll stop smoking, but today again the last one and then tomorrow again and so on. All\n these things happen. In which situation is this important? Do I have to consider this? In which situation is it not important?\n By the way, this is an important research area we do in Munich. It is a major topic where we ask ourselves exactly such questions.\n When can I work with the Homo economicus and come to good predictions and where do I not come to good predictions?\n Because people actually behave differently, are not so rational.\n Have you ever met a homo economicus?\n One single one.\n They don't normally behave like that.\n I think many people try to make reasonable decisions,\n but as I said, they are not always able to do so.\n For different reasons.\n But that doesn't necessarily mean that we can't start with the model.\n Yes, but if you say that, it doesn't really exist.\n Yes, again, the point is that we want to use these models to be able to predict something,\n to say that we are now leading a different policy, what will change then?\n And that should be a good prediction as much as possible.\n You can also work with simplified models if the assumption I make is not the decisive one.\n I can also analyze a market and say that it has two companies or it has five companies or it has ten companies.\n If the result is not dependent on whether there are three or four, then it doesn't matter whether I write three or four in there. So the question is,\n is that a clear assumption? If I take that assumption and if everything changes,\n then it is not a good assumption, then I should not make the assumption. But there are\n enough situations where that assumption is one that one can work with quite well and comes to\n reasonably reasonable conclusions,\n then I don't have to complicate life.\n The bad thing is, as soon as I say that people are not so rational,\n I have to have an idea of what form they are not rational in.\n What exactly is different for them?\n And if I think about insurance and see people overestimate small risks.\n The risk that their suitcase will be stolen.\n Close travel insurance.\n Complete nonsense if you calculate it rationally.\n Many people do that because they overestimate it.\n It's a great business model for the insurance companies that offer it.\n It would be a clever idea to take into account that people behave like that.\n Has Monika Schnitzer ever felt the invisible hand of the market?\n The invisible hand of the market.\n That's another metaphor for the economy. Yes, again, the idea is that people behave in their own sense, maximizing profit, maximizing profit,\n they don't care about what everyone else is doing.\n And how by a miracle it comes to a nice market result, where the goods are offered\n that I want to have and the companies make profits because the people buy it and\n no one has taken care of it.

In these cases, economists should use behavioral economic models that take into account these irrationalities. For instance, when analyzing insurance markets, economists should consider the overestimation of small risks and use models that account for this behavior. Additionally, economists can use models that consider bounded rationality, which acknowledges that individuals have limited capacity to process information and make decisions based on incomplete or uncertain information.

Many NGOs want that.\n What does that mean?\n That they simply have to pay their debts\n so that they no longer have to pay back parts of their entire annual economic income\n to us, to the World Bank, to the IMF?\n So in fact, there will probably be no way to get past that.\n What basically speaks against it?\n How do you ensure that such countries pay back their debts\n if they have taken up debts?\n By making it clear to them that if they don't pay back their debts,\n they won't get any more loans in the future.\n So ultimately, well, no, the army doesn't.\n I don't think that's what you do anymore.\n What you do is you work with reputation.\n You say if you don't pay your debts back, you won't get any more loans in the future.\n And then the worry is so great that you pay your debts back.\n If you just give up debt by saying debt cut, then you would say,\n okay, then that could be a bad example.\n Oh, I can afford it, I don't pay my debts back\n and then I get credits again later.\n So you're always afraid of this loss of reputation,\n that you're not tough and, accordingly,\n you may no longer keep up with it in the future.\n In fact, history shows that there have been countries\n that have gone bankrupt,\n who have not served their debts\n and then have received credits again later.

Should private believers give something away? Should the states give something away?\n So you always have to think carefully about who comes together there.\n Parisian club, Londoner club, are they private believers, are they state believers?\n Who should be asked be paid for it.\n But in Zurich there were always debt conferences, right?\n Yes, of course.\n Before the big wars.\n Yes, exactly.\n Not only then, but also in other places, when there were bigger crises and then some countries\n ...\n So, now we're talking about the climate.\n We have that now, the huge crisis.\n And that comes from the FDP side, we can't spend that much money on the climate, Monika.\n I think to myself, what's against that?\n In the end, money is artificial and in the end we could cut off the debt with a snap, as you said, that has happened historically over and over again.\n Because the emissions are real, in contrast to the money."

They are at the back of climate change.\n Yes, quite sure.\n But which parts, for example industries, we are an industrial country.\n Which industries in Germany will need help in the future with the transformation and which will not need help because they can either transform themselves or have no chance anyway?\n I don't want to judge who has no chance, but there are certainly some who are particularly in demand.\n I can name a few examples.

They have to invest now so that they can produce their steel with hydrogen, for example.\n Big investments.\n Do we have to transform the steel industry at any price? Or can't we say at some point, it's going to be too expensive, we'll let them die and then we'll get our steel from America or China?\n Because they'll also produce green at some point.\n So currently that is certainly the big discussion.\n Do we want to have all of this here with us?\n Yes, what do you say?\n Do we have to save and transform all the industries that we have now?\n No, certainly not. I don't think that makes sense.\n The question is which one you want to have,\n which one you find strategically important, so that you say, okay, you are dependent on it.\n I think steel is perhaps not as strong as computer chips. So maybe you want to focus more on the fact that you have these technologies here,\n also on site, simply because you want to have the technological know-how to\n not depend on others. But again, it is always a question of the geopolitical situation.\n We are now rising from coal, we are rising out of nuclear power and are currently still\n dependent on gas supplies. If we are not sure that they will also come, that we have\n options to avoid them, then we may have made wrong decisions. Maybe we\n didn't think about it smart enough. So with the car industry, do we need it soon?\n I mean,\n we have to make sure that we have significantly many, many millions of fewer cars on the\n streets. That means we have to massively restrict individual traffic. Do we still need the car industry?\n I think we will still have the car industry, but it has to transform massively. So first of all, we won't have the combustion engine anymore.\n And that means that it will be produced differently.\n Of course, this affects a lot of suppliers.\n We need a little the smartphone to the wheels.\n The car will no longer be sold because it has this great combustion engine or the great leather seats,\n but because the software in the car is so good.\n And that's what will make the value of the car in the future.\n But then I'm afraid that we'll soon be driving Apple and Samsung,\n because they are so far, miles away from software\n compared to our German car industry.\n Yes.\n That's a...\n That's the big fear now, right?\n A real concern.\n You should really be careful of that and make sure\n that you develop the cars yourself so that you can do that. I think that's something that has\n found far too little attention in the industry in recent years, but where you can see so gradually\n that you have to wake up and you have to wake up awake.

That was exactly\n the problem in recent years, that the automotive industry could always trust\n that the requirements would not be so harsh. They have made up their minds.\n That Germany also uses the EU to make it not so bad. And that's why we're so far behind in the end.\n Because you could get away with it for so long, it won't be that bad.\n Yes, the car industry wrote down the requirements itself. It has been\n reported that in Brussels the federal government then agreed on the requirements with the car industry.\n Yes, but that shows how dangerous it is when you be so strongly dependent on one industry as a country.\n That's something we've been saying for a long time. I was also long in the expert commission\n for research and innovation. We have always addressed the topic again and again. It is always called\n innovation from us comes so strongly from the automotive industry and that's true. They have an\n incredible level for research and development.\n But it's just the case that you're so incredibly dependent on this one industry,\n also when it comes to jobs.\n I mean, why are we so dependent? Because there are so many employees.\n And that's why we as a country have always focused very strongly on\n whether the automotive industry is doing well, then Germany is doing well too.\n And that's dangerous because you become so dependent on it.\n You also become dependent on export countries, like China.\n Why are we so good? Because the automobile industry exported so much to China.\n That's why we are now very dependent on China.\n If things are going well there, we are fine. If things are not going well there, we are not fine.\n And if there is political persecution, then we suddenly have concerns, oh, maybe things won't be so good for us anymore.\n So that all speaks very much for the fact that you have to be better diversified, that you should not make yourself too dependent on a branch.\n We are on the subject of innovation. Robert Habeck said today in a press conference that whoever wants to say say goodbye to economic growth want to say goodbye to innovation.\n Is this logic true?\n Well, now you have to think about what growth means and what innovation means.\n Innovation means that you always think of something new, you develop something new, a new product, new technology. That doesn't necessarily have to mean growth. You can also replace old things.\n That's exactly why some don't push for innovation, because they just think they're replacing their old product.\n So the automotive industry again as a very nice example.\n Why didn't they push an electric motor forward?\n Because they would have replaced it with a combustion engine. They wouldn't have sold more cars,\n they would have sold only other cars. That's why they didn't do that.

The industry is also facing the reality that combustion engines will become obsolete due to the superiority of alternative technologies and the increasing stringency of emission regulations. The industry is investing heavily in research and development to transition to electric vehicles and other sustainable technologies.

And now Tesla comes in and\n now you've suddenly seen, now, now there is a competition, we might have to work hard.\n So innovation is driven strongly by competition. If I know that with this innovation I can\n increase market share, I can acquire market share at all, I can get into the market.\n Tesla has seen that, I get into the market, then I have a strong incentive and then it can also lead to growth in the end.\n But Habeck didn't say no innovation without competition,\n but no innovation without growth. That's wrong.\n So I don't know exactly how he came up with that, but I wouldn't think about it that way.\n I would think that with innovations you can also generate growth in the end.\n Exactly, that's exactly the opposite. Innovation can enable growth.\n Yes, I would guess.\n And growth-based, not innovation.\n Without me hearing that from him, but that he means that you set resources free with growth\n in order to be able to invest in innovations again.\n That would be my assumption.\n The companies of politics have been trying to explain this for years and decades.\n And then the company taxes have been lowered over the last years and decades.\n The investments in innovation have not increased, but the dividends.\n Yes, that has also been proven. I think I told Achim last time.\n Where does innovation come from? We have constant growth.\n Yes, that's why I wouldn't have presented this context now, but I would have said that we need competition for this innovation we need competition. I think that's what we really need.\n Because if I don't have a competition, I don't have a big incentive to improve my products.\n I asked because you gave an interview last year online,\n you were asked, Ms Schnitzer, will we get the climate crisis under control through innovation?\n And you just said yes.\n Yes, yes, I think so too.\n Yes, I think so too. That means innovations are a possibility of how I can get the climate crisis under control through improved products and improved technologies. So different examples. to generate energy.\n We already have the phenomenon that renewable energies,\n in the sense of electricity, wind power or solar cells,\n that the innovations have led to the fact that it has become more and more affordable.\n We have had a cost reduction of 90% in recent years.\n This means that we have made technology better and better.\n We had learning effects.\n By rebuilding things over and over again,\n you learn to make things better every time.\n This means that we have had enormous cost reductions.\n And that will help us a lot\n if we roll out this technology even more now,\n hopefully with appropriate improved approval procedures, that we will benefit very much from it.\n But I also think of innovation that brings completely new technologies to market maturity at some point.\n So market maturity still needs a little.

That is, now things have to be driven out.\n Yes, and then you don't need, for example, as you said in your interview, maybe we have to ban a few things or, as you say, regulate them so that these innovations come faster, so that companies are forced to get there faster,\n where we want that? So now we think again about wind power. We now need\n the possibility that they were built faster, that we display the area and that we then\n shorten the planning and approval process so that it does not take six years, eight years until such a thing is in place, but that this happens in a much shorter time.\n Do regulations and bans play a role in your idea when you talk about innovation? Regulation, as I said, always sets the framework. Insofar as I am encouraging, if I say I will forbid something,\n then I will create an incentive to invent something else.\n We are now forbidding the nuclear industry, we are forbidding the coal industry,\n we will soon forbid the combustion engine industry.\n More or less in the way we make the requirements.\n Will that be done by itself? By the way we make the requirements. So it will be done by itself.\n By the way, it also applies to coal.\n I don't need to ban coal.\n I don't have to set the CO2 price high enough.\n Then they will rise by themselves at some point.\n Yes, these are exactly the regulations that ensure that the incentives are there.\n But then I still have to get it implemented.\n Then I have to be able to build the wind turbine, which I would like to build.\n Otherwise, bans, FCKW, let's think of that when we\n banned spray cans or refrigerators or something like that. Yes, a new technology has\n been found in a short time with which all this has been done.\n Are bans not the driver of innovation? Because then the architects or the engineers\n become creative through a ban or a restriction.\n So a ban or simply a high price. A ban is an infinitely high price.\n But we can't use the CO2 price everywhere in the climate crisis. We can't\n stand with the CO2 price out of the climate catastrophe.\n No, not because of that, because at some points it will lead to very high social\n violations and then we have to think about how we deal with it. So in that respect,\n you now have to vote on the individual instrument.\n We were already at the car industry, because today also oligopoly, you are a competition specialist.\n Robert Haberger has just mentioned oligopoly.\n He thinks it's stupid.\n Oligopoly doesn't have to be a damage to a business.\n Is there oligopoly in Germany?\n Is the automotive industry in Germany an oligopoly?\n Yes, of course.\n Why?\n Oligopoly simply means we have a few companies, not quite many, not just one.\n One would be a monopoly, if there are 15, it would be an oligopoly.\n If there are 15, it would be an oligopoly, exactly.

In Germany I have a few less automobile companies.\n In Europe I have a few more.\n I have a few more worldwide.\n Although I have only a few in Germany,\n they are still in competition.\n We experienced that quite strongly in the years\n when, for example, Japanese automobiles\n came to Germany very cheaply and then suddenly mixed up the market.\n And that was also experienced in the United States,\n how General Motors suddenly had to develop massively when foreign competition came in.\n So in that respect, the number of companies in their own country is not the decisive factor,\n but also at that point how many international competitions there are.\n But is there really an oligopoly in the car industry if there are a lot of foreign car manufacturers\n that also sell here? Do the German car manufacturers now make so much market?\n In their own segment, yes. So, as I said, it depends on which area we are talking about now.\n Are we talking about small cars, are we talking about luxury limousines?\n In the area of \u200b\u200bluxury limousines, there may not be as many providers.\n They are probably playing a very important role there.\n So the question is always, can they dominate the market on their own?\n No, they can't. They do look at what the others are doing. Nevertheless, we cannot talk about a complete competition.\n Certainly not. But they are under competition.\n I looked it up again.

That would be an oligopoly.\n Does that have to be broken down?\n Does that have to be broken down?\n Yes.\n In the sense of ...\n Monopoly, oligopoly are stupid for people like you who are in competition.\n So we have to get rid of that, right?\n So now, as I said, you have to think again about why there are larger units\n and how to ensure that there is still competition.\n So even if there are only a few companies, they can still compete.\n That depends on the possibilities.\n How easy it is to switch from one to the other, that plays a much bigger role.\n So, for example, if I am a mobile radio provider,\n if the other offers me better conditions, I can easily switch to it if the other person offers me better conditions.\n In two years, yes.\n Then I would have a strong competition. But if I can't do that because I've been bound for two years, then of course I don't have a strong competition.\n Do we have to break up the mobile radio oligopoly in Germany?\n We have to make sure that there is has it, just through such contract conditions.\n But why don't you want to break it down?\n What do I want to break it down into?\n That it no longer only has three mobile phone providers, but 30."

While they are under competition, they cannot be considered to have complete competition due to their market dominance. However, the competition between them is significant, and they keep an eye on each other's offerings. The ease of switching from one provider to another plays a crucial role in maintaining competition. If a customer can easily switch to a competitor offering better conditions, then the competition is stronger. Conversely, if customers are bound to a provider for an extended period, then the competition is weaker.

                "So even if there are only a few companies, they can still compete.\n That depends on the possibilities.\n How easy it is to switch from one to the other, that plays a much bigger role.\n So, for example, if I am a mobile radio provider,\n if the other offers me better conditions, I can easily switch to it if the other person offers me better conditions.\n In two years, yes.\n Then I would have a strong competition. But if I can't do that because I've been bound for two years, then of course I don't have a strong competition.\n Do we have to break up the mobile radio oligopoly in Germany?\n We have to make sure that there is has it, just through such contract conditions.\n But why don't you want to break it down?\n What do I want to break it down into?\n That it no longer only has three mobile phone providers, but 30.\n That doesn't necessarily have to be useful, because the question is, as I said, how efficient can they work? So again, the point is, what does the technology look like?\n Is it sensible that only one person does it, because it is then much more efficient,\n because I have scale effects, one would say, because it is practically cheaper\n to simply produce a lot of pieces, or is it sensible,\n or can I do it just as well in a very small framework?\n Depending on the situation, I would like to design the companies in different sizes,\n but still want to ensure that they are in competition.\n So it's not a problem because there are only three providers, as long as they don't disagree.\n So as long as I can prevent them from...\n They will keep it a secret, we will never know.\n Yes, you should look very closely at it and you can do a lot. But that is of course exactly the topic that you look at it very closely and you can do a lot, but that's exactly the topic, that you look at it and then make sure that it is easy to change.\n That would definitely be for competition.\n But if they secretly agree, Monika, that we have the prices all the same and the rates are the same all the time small. It doesn't matter if I can change now or not.\n Yes, if they are doing a competition under the influence of the environment, then it is so.\n Yes, that's right.\n Then we have to break up.\n If that gives the technology here, so if that doesn't increase the costs much,\n then that could be useful.\n So especially with large companies, with monopolies,\n that's exactly a topic that you really have to address.\n Now you have to ask yourself at this point, there are some markets\n that are more or less monopolistic.\n Let's think of Google Search, that's more or less between a monopoly market.\n Other providers, Amazon. We are moving towards monopoly. The question is, why is that the case\n and how can you deal with it? Why is that the case?\n At this point we also have a strong, so we don't just have the technology that,\n if I have achieved a certain size,\n that I can produce much more efficiently than the others.\n I also have the strong network effects.\n So when I think of Facebook, we think of something like that.\n I want to go to a provider when there are my friends.\n I don't want to be divided over many different systems.\n In the end, everyone wants to be with one system because everyone is their friend.\n That means I have these network effects that ultimately make it easier for one company is getting bigger and bigger, that markets are falling, you could say,\n and I have two, but it's actually even better\n if there are even more of my friends in one network,\n then ultimately they all gather together.\n That would be a classic, we would say, natural monopoly, it is ultimately perhaps even efficient that there is only one of these companies, but that does not mean that it is good.\n And then you would have had the approach earlier, so earlier you would have thought about such natural monopolies, then the state pays attention to it and the fact that the prices are not too high or we regulate it. Or we break it down. Yes, exactly. And at that point\n you have to think about what you are breaking down, at which intersection you are breaking down.\n And at this point you may want to prevent the monopoly power from being transferred from one market to another market.\n So Google, for example, let's go back to the example of Google, a search."

            "reference_answer": "\nMonika Schnitzer discusses the debate on whether to break up the monopolies of mobile radio providers in Germany. She argues that even if there are only a few providers, competition can still exist if it is easy to switch from one to the other. However, she also acknowledges that if there are contractual obligations preventing the switch, then competition is weakened. Schnitzer suggests that the focus should be on ensuring that it is easy to change providers, which would promote competition.\nShe also discusses the topic of natural monopolies, using examples like Google Search and Facebook. According to her, these companies have achieved a certain size that allows them to produce more efficiently than their competitors due to economies of scale. Additionally, they have strong network effects, making it easier for users to stay within one system due to the presence of their friends or contacts. Schnitzer argues that these natural monopolies can ultimately lead to markets falling and the concentration of power in one company, which can be inefficient and potentially harmful to consumers. She suggests that the state could intervene by regulating prices or breaking up the monopolies, but also notes the importance of considering the intersection at which the monopoly power is being broken down",

And at that point\n you have to think about what you are breaking down, at which intersection you are breaking down.\n And at this point you may want to prevent the monopoly power from being transferred from one market to another market.\n So Google, for example, let's go back to the example of Google, a search.\n The problem is that the search has now become a gatekeeper.\n So everyone is looking for something and through this search they then reach a company. And a company that now does advertising wants to place its advertising on this search engine.\n And that's why Google is not just a monopolist for search, but also a monopolist for advertising.\n And now we have practically transferred monopoly power from one market to another market and we want to prevent that.\n So it would make sense to separate the search from the advertising market, from the other activities that Google does.\n That means there would be a defeat, indeed, make sense. And you could also imagine that in other markets. a But I still want to reach my old friends. I might go to a new provider now,\n it's not called Facebook, it's called something else. But I still want to reach the others.\n And you can make sure that you create interoperability. So by going to\n another provider, but still reaching my old friends. By setting up interfaces.\n So I make the statement that there are interfaces that I can still reach the old friends,\n then I have the chance to have a competition and at the same time to still maintain these network effects, which led to the monopoly.\n You have now fled a bit. I wanted to talk about the oligopoly in Germany, it's not just about the mobile telecom market. You have pledged for nothing. What about the electricity market?\n E.ON, NBW, RWE and Vattenfall control 80% of the electricity market. Is that an oligopoly?\n You can't even say that it's an oligopoly. Actually, they are already regional monopolies.\n So we have to break it down.\n Now we are actually at exactly one such point where you ask yourself,\n why are the monopolies in their markets and what is the decisive factor there?\n The decisive factor at this point is, what do they produce?\n Is it sensible that one company produces it?\n Could more produce it?\n Yes.\n What about the line network?\n We may not need five different networks.\n That is exactly the reason why such things were typically made state-owned in the past.\n Then they said, well, you only need one network,\n by the way, like the telephone network.\n The decisive factor was really the limiting factor,\n which you only wanted to have once, the network.\n And then the offer on this network.\n So these networks, there is no reason to move power networks five times,\n so that either one or the other network.\n I just want that once.\n The production, which can take place in competition, who produces electricity, that doesn't have to be a monopolist, there is no reason at all.\n And the offering, the selling of this electricity as a provider, as a service provider. There can also be quite a few. So the\n only thing to decide is the network. There doesn't necessarily have to be three or four different\n networks. There is one network. This network must be regulated. Who has access to this network?\n Under what conditions can I transport my electricity from the plant to the customer via this network.\n This requires the corresponding regulation, which we also have.\n But otherwise I can have different providers that produce electricity\n and different providers that bring the electricity to the customer.\n I didn't understand if you want to destroy our regional monopolists or our electricity market oligopoly?\n That's not something I've thought about, to be honest.\n But that's a problem, isn't it?\n How much competition we have there.\n Yes.

Who knows?\n Let's see.\n You have a few minutes left to google your questions or to give the questions to Hans, because after this there will be questions from the audience.\n I'm on the last line now.\n And you are a specialist in innovation economics, besides competition policy.\n We have already talked about innovations in climate change.\n Other points are vaccines.\n Robert Halberg was still there last year for the patent release, global patent release for vaccines.\n Today he no longer needs it, after he talked to the pharmaceutical companies that are affected by it.\n How do you deal with it?\n Because the federal government is one of the few governments in the world that says no to this, that protects its pharmaceutical industry.\n And the argument is, Monika, if we give away the patents, there will be no more innovation.\n Is that scientifically sustainable?\n Yes, of course it is sustainable.\n So first of all, you ask yourself, what is there something like patents? I explained at the beginning what the great thing about innovation is,\n that knowledge produces what many can use,\n so what is useful for many.\n But if I invent something new and everyone uses it,\n then it is not clear that I will get my costs back.\n If I develop a drug and everyone can produce it and I can no longer earn money with it,\n then I would not want to develop this drug.\n Unless I get the order for it, that's another possibility.\n Of course, you can also give incentives by saying,\n I write down a price for who develops say, I'll write a price tag for whoever develops the drug.\n That would be another variant. But typically the variant we have is that we say there is a patent for it.\n For a certain time I have the monopoly on this drug and that gives me the chance to get money back.\n The point is, there are a lot of things being developed, only a few of them are successful, only a few are coming to market maturity, so that I can actually introduce the product, that it really works and I can sell it.\n And the few then also have to finance the development costs for all the other drugs.\n Now I can say that in this very special case I have developed a drug that is incredibly important and that should be used very widely very quickly.\n The problem we had at that point was not whether the others could now license it\n and use this knowledge, but whether the others had the capacity, the production capacity.\n That was the limiting factor at the beginning. And for that ...\n That's there now. There are 120 locations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, where they could\n start immediately.\n Exactly, but that's what it was about at the beginning, when a lot was discussed about this patent protection.\n Should you just give the patent away?\n That's still a topic. So the point at this point is now, to what license fees are the patents provided?\n It's not about license fees, the federal government wants that.\n Because then you can still earn money. There is a patent exemption.\n And we're talking about a drug with an example here,\n which you couldn't have developed if you hadn't received hundreds of millions of euros from the state.\n Yes, so that you also get money from the state for it, that's exactly what it is.\n And then the state doesn't get anything back? Except taxes on the company's profits?\n Well, I think the state has actually received a lot of money back at this point.\n Let's take another look at it."

They also have pharmaceutical companies.\n So the point is always how many production capacities I have.\n I would like to see the numbers first.\n There are now 120.\n Yes, and then they can also produce.\n Without patents.\n But the patents will be made available. They will then be made available against license fees.\n Yes, so that BioNTech and Co. can make more money.\n But we are talking about a global pandemic and we want it to end as soon as possible.\n And this is about social health. You said yourself in the Zeitinterview that if the state spends a lot of money on research, it is also useful to direct this money to areas that are particularly important for society.\n But that's exactly what happened. This money went into areas so that the patents have been developed. Yes, we are back to capitalism. The state socializes the investment and the profits are privatized.\n The state benefits from the private profits at this point,\n because the companies pay taxes.\n So again, Mainz, commercial taxes,\n they don't know where to go with their money.\n Suddenly Rheinland-Pfalz becomes a net payer in the financial balance,\n because this one country takes so much money.\n Yes, there are a few winners, of course.\n But the majority of the world's population suffers from the fact that we don't release the patents.\n No, it suffers from the fact that not enough is produced.\n Because the patents are not released.\n I don't see that yet.\n As I said, the incentives to do this are there.\n I don't see that this is due to the patents yet.\n I don't know what license fees are provided,\n but that they are provided ...\n But maybe no African factory,\n where it can be produced immediately,\n can't afford the licenses, because they would cost something.\n No, I think the problem is more, so again, we talked about it all the time at the beginning.\n The problem is that production is not that easy, that you need a lot of know-how\n and that it is not so easy to transfer. So even if I just give someone the patent,\n I still don't have the know-how with which to actually drive this production.\n But that's exactly what I need the cooperation between the companies for.\n What I also need the support for.\n And that then ensures that I can also produce in the end.\n So just giving patents freely, saying here I give you the patent, use it without me having the appropriate support, that does not lead to the appropriate production.\n But why did there, for example, there is a patent exemption for AIDS drugs, AIDS drugs. Why is there still innovation?\n If you say patents prevent innovation.\n You said scientifically, is that sustainable?\n If you give patents away, then it harms the ability to innovate.\n The question is what that does to the innovation incentives, if I have to assume that.\n I invest a lot and in the end I can't make any more income with it.\n But they have already made income."

I can imagine that this is the relationship.\n Okay, so I'm not a Keynesian, I'm not interested in dealing with it every day. Good. Annika S. wants to know if there are parallels between the game theory and Adam Smith's theory of the invisible hand of the market.\n You already talked about that earlier. My question is, was that actually a theory by Smith or was it more of a side note that only appears once in the World of Nations, the invisible hand of the market?\n So actually, is that something that made history?\n People are constantly talking about whether that played such a big role in his work.\n That's something for the Adam Smith apologists.\n I once read that it actually only appeared in one half-sentence and then it became self-sufficient.\n Interestingly, you can find any half-sentence on any topic at Adam Smith.\n You can talk about any topic and he has already said something about it.\n But it's a difference whether it's a half-sentence or a theory behind it.\n Or whether there is a theory that only needs a half-sentence.\n As always, Radioactive Stardust wants to know\n if more competition can prevent the climate catastrophe\n or if the climate catastrophe didn't arise because of the competition as we know it?\n Now you have to ask yourself, competition between whom?\n We had already discussed it earlier, what is the solution to the climate disaster?\n That we use too many resources that are harmful to the climate. And that was of course favorable,\n that there was competition,\n because of course competition\n makes you even better\n if you keep up with the corresponding profit maximization.\n So that means that it may use too many of these resources.\n That a state would not do this without competition\n is not to be said, because now let's take a look at China, let's take a look at Russia,\n they have exactly the same climate problems. But they are in the global competition.\n Yes, but that has nothing to do with it at this point. They also have climate problems\n without being in competition. They have also produced with resources,\n with fossil energy carriers,\n which are climate-damaging.\n So I would not necessarily\n refer to the competition.\n I think the idea behind it is that\n the kind of, I'll call it now,\n capitalist competition that we know\n means the effectiveness of winning, i.e the maximization of profits by reducing costs.\n This means that I don't care about the costs of production.\n We know this at least from the early days of capitalism,\n where the costs and the burdens of production, also the exploitation of resources,\n were not calculated, but they were left to the free play of force. I think that's what's behind it.\n It's just the problem in general that you haven't taken into account the negative effects at all.\n And that's because you haven't created any rules\n to make them available. So you didn't give them a price. You were allowed to pollute the\n environment as much as you wanted. You didn't regulate that. You didn't say who pollutes the water\n has to pay a price for it, who releases emissions into the environment has to pay a price for it.\n The nuclear power plant runs for 40 years and generates costs, million years or more, for the storage and maintenance of the radiation."

            "reference_answer": "\nThe Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance, and the Chancellor's Office are the key decision-makers in economic policies in Germany. They discuss and determine economic policies, including those related to Keynes' theory of affordability and the potential impact of competition on the climate catastrophe. Keynes' theory of affordability suggests that if a country wants to do something, it can afford to do so by printing money. This is a controversial interpretation, and it is not clear if Keynes intended it that way. The debate on this topic is ongoing among economists.\nRegarding the impact of competition on the climate catastrophe, it is a complex issue. Competition can lead to the efficient use of resources and cost reduction, but it can also result in the overuse of resources that are harmful to the environment, such as those contributing to the climate catastrophe. The solution to the climate disaster is not simply more competition, but rather the implementation of regulations and pricing mechanisms that incentivize the use of sustainable resources and penalize the use of harmful ones. The state can play a crucial role in this regard by setting rules and prices that reflect the true cost of production and environmental impact.\nThere",

Then I can control at this point.\n I'm not saying you should, but I could.

Why not? Or what would have to be fulfilled so that Monika Schnitzer says, yes,\n we should introduce a price binding or price control in the housing market.\n Yes, that is definitely not a market that we are now talking about in connection with inflation,\n because the current inflation, as far as we can see, has been driven strongly by the\n energy prices.

What do you think of that?\n First and second, should there be something like a\n maximum wage? The question of a maximum wage came from several. Okay, I have to think about that first.\n But I can say something about the minimum wage. So there was actually the Nobel Prize for David\n Card, who did very interesting studies on the minimum wage. With the minimum wage, we could\n talk about it for hours now, is that a good idea or not, such a minimum wage. If you look at the simple model,\n offer, demand, introduce minimum wage, so that it is a wage that is higher than the market price,\n then we would generate unemployment. And you might not want that. What David\n Card has just done is to look at this minimum minimum wage actually leads to unemployment,\n i.e. to less employment.\n And he did this in different scenarios where empirical evidence was seen\n that this does not necessarily lead to unemployment.\n I think Germany has also provided evidence that it is not necessary that the minimum wage leads to an increase in unemployment in modest forms.\n Exactly. So maybe at this point, what are the arguments why this does not necessarily lead to unemployment? One argument is that if there is a monopolistic employer, one who is a local monopolist or oligopole who is negotiating.\n Definitely. How much wage is paid, then a minimum wage would be a possibility to increase the wage without causing unemployment. The second point is that if it's about goods that you can't trade,\n for example a hairdresser's haircut,\n I can get it locally or not.\n And if a minimum wage is introduced,\n the hairdresser will have to raise the price a bit.\n That's why I can't go to the hairdresser's in the next city. I'll still do it locally. Maybe I'll go to the hairdresser has to raise the price a bit. That's why I can't go to the hairdresser in the next city.\n So I'll still do it locally.\n Maybe I'll go to the hairdresser a little less.\n But overall it will just raise the price a bit.\n Typically, it doesn't lead to more unemployment.\n Third case still,\n if it is actually about tradable goods,\n so not the hairdresser,\n but now somehow a product that I buy,\n which can also be delivered from somewhere else.\n In the end, you see that it usually leads to the companies becoming a little more productive.\n Yes, they have to pay a little higher wages,\n they then try to rationalize differently.\n That doesn't mean that there will be more unemployment.\n And the question, maybe you could think about it in parallel, should there be a maximum wage analog to the minimum wage?\n Some say that manager salaries are actually something like super maximum wages, you don't have to limit them. The question is, why are there these high salaries? Are there really such scarce resources?\n Are there so few good managers that you have to pay them so incredibly much?\n Obviously, some people see it that way.\n I think it's actually in the interest of the shareholders to make sure that it's not that high.\n So what makes a manager so valuable that you have to pay such high wages?\n You can really think about that.\n But actually that's the issue of the owner of the company. Why do they pay such high taxes. You can really think about that.\n But actually that's the topic of the owner of the company.\n Why do they pay so high?\n Yes, but maybe there could be smart tricks in terms of economy.\n We can talk about that.\n Lupino Arts, is an alternative to market economy conceivable,\n which is not planned economy?"

Not everyone can\n afford it and currently with the high energy prices, imports, we just talked about it,\n the prices are even higher. We have to create a social balance. There are two possibilities\n for the CO2 price. You could say you use two possibilities with the CO2 price.\n You could say that you use the money from the CO2 price\n and just return it in a partial way.\n That was at least the idea of the Green election program.\n And now, also today, at the presentation of the annual economic report,\n it is somewhat nebulous as the plan of climate money has been thought up.\n Do you support that? Is that necessary?\n Is that being pushed forward with sufficient speed?\n Whether that happens or not, I cannot estimate that now. But that this is the right idea,\n that is of course the case. Because the point is, I don't want to introduce the CO2 price\n to get people's money out of their pockets, but to change the relative prices. I want to make fossil energy carriers more expensive and then give them the incentive to\n go into renewable energies.\n But people also have to have the opportunity to switch out.\n So they have to be able to afford an electric car, they have to find the charging station,\n they have to have the money to build a better heating system.\n All of that has to happen.\n There has to be public transport.\n There have to be alternatives.\n And the question is, can people afford it?\n At this point, as I said...\n At this point, apparently not yet.\n Exactly. At this point I need the support.\n So by either giving back the CO2 price in installments,\n so that I already have the relative price, but at the same time I have not made people poorer.\n I can also use the money differently. I can, for example, reduce the electricity tax or deduct the EG-input.\n In this way I make the electricity cheaper and if the electricity is produced with renewable energy, then I will have the double effect that I will make it cheaper to use the electricity.\n Yes, that's the theory, Professor. But in reality it looks like even if the EEG circulation is taken out of the electricity bill relatively quickly,\n it does not lead to the people being compensated for the increased energy costs, but that only the taxation is perhaps a little slower. So what is the way out then? Because people don't have\n more money in their pockets. Yes exactly, that's a very good point.

Nevertheless, I have to relieve the lower income groups again.\n I think that this will be an important role, especially now with the high energy costs.\n So, for example, people who are dependent on social assistance, then I have to adjust the rates.\n If the prices are higher, then I also have to adjust the rates.\n I may have to adjust the living allowance.\n I may give a bonus for children.\n I have to see how I can relieve the groups that are particularly affected by it, that can afford it, how I relieve them.\n I don't see that everyone is relieved, because if the energy prices are high because we import more expensively, that means we have become poorer.\n Some have to bear that, those who can afford it must bear it.\n In this context, Mark Oehl asks again, if the CO2 price is returned in the form of climate money,\n then the steering effect does not evaporate.\n So his example is then, if the flight is 50 euros more expensive,\n but I have 50 euros more in my wallet,\n where is the steering effect then?\n The steering effect is there because the flight is 50 euros more expensive\n and I now ask myself, should I really fly or should I take the train?\n That's the point.\n So the steering effect is there because the relative price has changed.\n And if I get the money back in installments, then it's definitely back.\n Heggie asks, why do you see money as a resource,\n although it is not limited to the right resources? Where do you see that? MMT says, we can print or countries can print money as much as they want.\n It is basically, in contrast to coal, oil, whatever, an unlimited resource.\n Yes, I think that just makes it clear that we always deal with the term money very sluggishly.\n We talk about who earns a lot of money.\n In the end, we mean at this point who has a high income.\n So money is ultimately the payment, but it is not a resource.\n Whoever says that was absolutely right. We only use it in the\n conversational sense as an expression of, wow, he has a lot of money. Ultimately,\n this means that he has a high income, a high fortune. At this point, it's not about\n the euro bills he has in his pocket. Christoph K.: How do you assess the impact of artificial intelligence and high frequency trading\n simply exploded.

That will actually affect a lot. I'm going to leave that out.\n To add to that, Phil Bronco, e-commerce. Should the taxation be bound to the place of purchase, for example, in order to counteract tax ev losses in the municipalities? At the place of purchase.\n Yes, so if e-commerce, i.e. if online orders are made,\n the individual dealer has income losses on site,\n the taxation of the income or profits of e-commerce\n should be realized there, where the product is ultimately delivered.\n That's interesting because it's a very similar question to how we deal with tax internationally,\n i.e. with the big digital companies. So far we have the principle that the tax is paid where the\n business district is and not where the income is generated. That's why we get the taxes from our automobile companies.\n Even if they sell cars in China, if we tied it to the sales location now,\n then we wouldn't have this income anymore. That's why Germany has\n had a hard time turning around there so far. But in fact that's ...\n But that's a different situation with e-commerce. Because what is delivered online is a real choice for the seller on site who would otherwise have delivered this product.\n That's right. The question is, this would require that the law is adjusted accordingly. In the international area, I have already pointed out\n why Germany was so reserved so far,\n because tax revenues would then fall out of certain areas.\n But now in the EU, they have agreed that,\n not only in the EU, but also in the rest of the world,\n that we should go in this direction,\n that we should actually include a part of the revenue\n on the location where the revenue is generated.\n And the same could be done here at e-commerce.\n In Germany I have not yet seen that this is discussed in that sense,\n but it would be worth considering. I would not exclude that.\n Enlirat, what to do against too big to fail? Corporations like VW, Lufthansa, banks are saved\n because it would obviously be seen as a catastrophe a catastrophe if they go bankrupt.\n On the other hand, there have been bankruptcies before.\n If banks are gambling, why does the taxpayer have to pay for it?\n Yes, because the companies are obviously so big that you are afraid,\n worried that the bigger even if they are very large companies. In the banking sector, you are always worried that systemic risks will follow.\n If one bank is bankrupt, then others will also suffer.\n With large companies, it is always about the topic of how it is with the jobs.\n If too many people suddenly become worried that they will lose their jobs,\n that is a big problem. And I think you have to make sure that even if it comes to such a great misery,\n which does not mean that everyone will be on the street for eternity afterwards.\n Was it wrong that in the pandemic the state bought or took over Lufthansa shares?\n That's a concrete example.\n You shouldn't have done that?\n No, at this point I think it was actually useful.\n But now again, at this point it's not about\n simply saving jobs.\n I still had an overarching goal.\n The company could have been bought.\n So, let's say Lufthansa went bankrupt, then another company, another airline from another country would have taken over.\n What would have been the problem?\n The problem would have been that,\n as a precaution, the hubs that we have lost in Germany."

These direct connections are extremely helpful\n for the economy, because you can then very quickly, for example, bring the mechanic\n abroad who installs the machine there, which you sold there. So such hubs\n are very important and they might have been lost.\n So, that would have been a major economic disadvantage.\n That's why I think it was right at this point.\n We come to the last two or three questions.\n Joachim Meier, HiTOOS. How do you assess OPP,\n partnership projects, partnership between private investors and the public, for example, street-kits, swimming pools and their consequences for already\n common cash. What would you do differently?\n What would I do differently? I think, fundamentally, this is an idea that\n can be set up, but it's not necessarily the only way to ensure that these projects can be carried out.\n It has many advantages and disadvantages, you would have to talk about it longer.\n So I don't think it's bad in principle, but not necessary in principle either. And then there were a whole series of questions about pension. I think you've already positioned yourself there, if I'm not mistaken, you said higher pension age. Why or shouldn't it be lowered, as Janine says?\n The pension age is lowered. What would be the reason why I wanted to reduce it? For example, because the burden of people in their working hours is also intensified,\n because people may not be allowed to work until they are totally exhausted,\n because productivity has increased.\n Okay, so we can now do a whole show, but I'll try to keep it short.\n The next time.\n Exactly, I'll try to keep it short. So people just live a lot longer nowadays than they did before.\n At the beginning of the show I told you that my grandparents had just turned 65, some didn't, a few months more.\n Back then, the retirement age was 65, so they didn't have any pension. Nowadays, people are at least 20 years older.\n And it's not obvious that you can't work a little longer.\n You live a lot longer, you can work a little longer.\n The point is simply that we have received too few children to continue to finance the pension as we have currently acquired it.\n In any case financed by the reserve.\n Financed by the reserve, exactly.\n And that means that currently three people work for one pensioner.\n In 15 years there are only two people who work for one pensioner.\n Somewhere the money has to come from and that can either be made possible by saying,\n okay, we will lower the pension claims a bit by working longer.\n Or by saying, we won't let the pension rise so much.\n That would be a second option for me.\n You go in with a certain pension claim,\n but it doesn't increase with the wages, but a little less.\n Or by saying people with more pension points,\n with more pension points, don't get as much as those with less.\n So you divide the group of richer pensioners within the pension group,\n so with more claims, they don't get as much as the poorer pensioners.\n So that you contribute a certain redistribution within the group.\n But somehow you have to finance it.\n Yes, how do the others do that? In Germany, with the predicted pension,\n Germany has 2017 figures with about 50% of the previous salary below the OECD average.\n Austria, Croatia, the Netherlands are much higher. Much higher."

And that's the difference. So that's not that high.\n But it's not just, if that's the argument, it wouldn't be just in the first years of the pension,\n where the pensioner, the pensioner, also has something of it.\n Important that you have a relatively high pension level there.\n As I said, then the question is how this will develop further. And at this point\n you can talk about high pensions if you say that you don't let the pension rise so much.\n But you always have to look at the overall package, also how it looks with business pensions.

No, not with everyone. That's why will have to pay a company pension. Then people might... Do you think it's the same for everyone?

The Netherlands pay higher pensions than the average wage before.\n Croatia is right. How do they do that?\n Some have actually provided a larger share of the gross domestic product for the pension.\n In France it would be like that, in Italy it would be like that.\n But it's not like that for them it's sustainable that they see that they can do it in the future.\n In part, they have already imposed pension reforms that should stabilize the system in the long term, because they themselves see that it cannot work like that anymore.\n Again to the wealth tax, would that be the possibility of filling this pension hole.\n Personally, I think that the wealth tax is the wrong tax because it is enormously difficult to drive into.\n Generated high administrative costs, high compensation costs and can be easily avoided by the people you would really like to have it from.\n Which would be the right one then the wrong one is the property tax?\n The inheritance tax.

Again, you could do a whole\n show about it. What is the problem with that? Because of the tax classes 3 and 5, we have the problem\n that even if it doesn't make any difference at all which tax class I am, which has no influence\n on what I really pay at the end of the year.\n In the moment when I get the salary certificate as someone who is in tax class 5,\n I have very high withdrawals.\n Someone who is in tax class 3 has very low withdrawals.\n This is because in tax class 3 and 5 I do not have a free amount.\n The free amount goes to those with tax class 3, so that the deductions are very high.\n I then have a low income and huge deductions from it.\n If we make that practical, the classic model of the marital split was an old role model.\n The husband usually earned relatively well, but due to the split between the husband and wife,\n it was done as if half of the income was earned by the wife who is not working or working as a housewife.\n As if that were in similar heights.\n And so both paid less taxes in the sum.\n I think they said that the average earner would be around 5,000 euros a year,\n which would be saved by the marriage garden splitting. That is the reality, so to speak.\n What is the alternative?\n So again, why is that a problem that I have been doing this so far with these tax classes?\n Because for typically the woman it looks like, for what I give to work, really little comes out.\n And that reduces the incentive to actually take on a job.\n Why is it so problematic when it stops women from working?\n Because they typically don't expect\n that they will be fired.\n And if they are fired, they have to find a job for themselves in the future.\n And if they have worked little before, part-time or not, they will not get a job very well.\n So they will have very high salary increases in the future.\n They don't expect that their partner might die.\n We have exactly the same problem.\n So you're not prepared to have to work full-time again independently.\n You have considerable inputs and can't get along with it anymore.\n It also has to do with the negotiation position within the partnership.\n If one brings home so little money on paper and the other so much,\n many then don't really distribute the money half and half, but you do that.\n You imagine yourself like this, I don't bring much here, I don't bring much to Bayern, I may not have many claims to report.\n So all of this typically keeps women from working full time and they don't see that they are interfering with it. Is the economic scientist or the woman engaged in this argument?\n Both, and the woman is the economist in the sense that\n that keeps women from being available on the labor market,\n where they are actually very well trained.\n But we have a lack of skilled workers, so we are missing the women.\n Or to be able to make themselves available.\n That's also a perspective.\n And to prevent old age poverty.\n These are typically the single parents who get into old age poverty\n because they can no longer take care of themselves,\n because they have suddenly turned to themselves with modern divorce law\n and can no longer do it well, because they can no longer get by in their job.\n So at this point we actually have the economic problem.\n The committed woman in the sense that you see many women underestimate what this means for them and thus become dependent on things they shouldn't do.\n That means that self-employment and this informed decision to know what I'm getting into, if I'm getting into such a model, is actually important.\n And at this point it is also important to explain what this means."

For instance, in the case of wind power, if the population is not taken into consideration, the implementation of wind turbines may not be successful.\nTo bring businesses on board with this consensus, Monika suggests making it clear to them that there are opportunities in the transformation process and that they can develop business models for themselves to be at the forefront. She also mentions that businesses that do not agree with the transformation can serve as an exit model for others.

How is that to explain?\n So at the moment we are all talking a lot about why so much is being looked at in the East again and again.\n There are probably many explanations.\n On the one hand, you can maybe ask a generational question and say, basically, if the first generation,\n I'll explain that from the perspective of migration research, that's my job, I'm not a research researcher from East Germany. But from that perspective, we say the first generation,\n which comes, is more concerned with materialistic things.\n Where will I live? Where do my children go to school?\n How do I get in touch here? How do I learn the language codes?\n And how do I even learn to move in this new society?\n These are actually the central concerns.

To look at these stereotypes, we chose two groups\n that are actually seen as completely different in the social perception,\n but both are strongly negatively framed in discourse\n or are partly also burdened to strong stigmas.\n And we focused on the East German and Muslim group,\n because the discourse is very much about these two groups,\n rather than the others to what I just said,\n West German normality paradigm.\n And then we first conducted preliminary studies\n and my colleague, who promoted this to East German identity,\n first asked the people in smaller groups what actually bothers them the most when East Germans are spoken about.\n And then worked out three central stereotypes, for example the accusation of always complaining.\n Even if the complaint is legitimate, keyword Yamaossi, the other was that this accusation of the\n overall brown east, i.e. not distancing oneself enough from extremism, was sued and\n thirdly this idea that one would actually not belong to this Germany image. Then we had insights from preliminary studies that this is also something that is\n strongly thought about by Muslim groups, namely as soon as this moment\n arises to complain, for example about Islamist hostility or\n unequal structures, that then the accusation comes, now you take the victim perspective again\n or Muslims are confrontational with the extremism and Islamism accusation comes then, now you take the victim perspective again. Or Muslims are confronted with extremism and Islamism in a pausal.\n And even after 60 years the thought is that they have not yet arrived in today's Germany.\n And then it is clear that today's Germany is in the imagination the West German Federal Republic.\n We then asked 7,000 people on the phone.\n It was a representative survey of the population and in fact we could\n see that the stereotypes were distributed relatively evenly. How do you do that?\n We have always asked the same question,\n according to the stereotypes, but we exchanged the group.

Once we asked\n East Germans constantly see themselves as victims,\n half of them, and the other half we asked, Muslims constantly see themselves as victims.\n Exactly the same with extremism and with today's Germany.\n So we were able to compare the two groups and recognize that the\n stereotypical density was relatively comparable to each other.\n Are there there differences?\n Only with the item they have not yet arrived in today's Germany.\n With the other two it was consistent, about 30% of West Germans think that\n both from the East Germans and from the Muslims.\n We have the next step afterwards, first we have only captured the stereotypes\n and then came a few exciting effects Then we wanted to investigate some interesting effects.\n Are the East Germans aware of this?\n And what does this actually do?\n If you know there are certain evaluations against one group,\n this may lead to a solidarity effect against other evaluated groups.\n It would be a bit close to believe that you connect with each other when you know\n the recognition is also denied to another group.\n I'll start with the fact that we didn't find that, but what we found,\n which was also interesting, was we called it deprivation sensitivity,\n so this feeling of being treated unequally in society.\n You can ask classic questions like East Germans are treated as citizens of the second class\n or East Germans have to work harder to achieve the same\n or East Germans do not have the same access to all positions. We asked the same again with regard to Muslims. And look, we could see\n the assessment of East Germans towards Muslims was very much influenced by the fact that\n one was aware that this group is located below in society. But interestingly,\n the East Germans\n have located themselves on the same level. We then briefly considered whether we could make a frame out of it.\n East Germans see themselves as the Muslims of society, but then we held back because\n we thought that this could be misunderstood. But in fact it is interesting.\n But I mean, some people think that you somehow equate Muslims with East Germans, understand, but in fact it is interesting.\n But I mean, some people think that you are somehow equating Muslims with East Germans,\n we have the same problems. Exactly not and that's why it's\n interesting to question the feeling. So if you look in and say empirically,\n so we can hold empirically, there is an inequality. East Germans have\n a lower pension level, are more affected by poverty,\n have significantly lower distribution of wealth, even 30 years after the end.\n These are points that cannot be denied.\n Now, what you can't deny is this factor,\n more than 50 percent, by the way, said that, from their own group,\n that they do not have the same access to social positions.\n That's right, we have about 20 percent of East Germans in this country, but only 5 percent in the elites.\n So that's not an education to say that.\n And that's why this accusation of the victim narrative is so infamous,\n because this accusation repeatedly brings the reference to inequality\n into such a realm of legend, as if one were to imagine it.\n And that also makes something about it, we can maybe talk about it later,\n when discrimination as such is always read as something emotional\n and not as something hand-written, structural.\n But what you just asked is, of course,\n Muslims in this society are significantly more\n affected by discrimination, significantly more\n by racist conclusions, which does not happen\n in the case of the East Germans.\n They have much less access to social positions and so on.\n But the more interesting it is to see where the East Germans\n position themselves. And what consequences does that have afterwards? But it is even more interesting to see where the East Germans are in their self-image.\n And what consequences does that have afterwards? That was the third step.\n We then simulated an ascent of Muslims.\n I would be afraid if more and more Muslims came into leadership positions, for example.\n Or if the rise in education of Muslims would then be at the expense of my own group."

But we found out that the stronger the integration of this group, the more defensive the integration discourse is.\n So actually a paradox.\n The more we document the ascents of migrants, the more harsh the defense is.\n And we could see that in this case too, so almost consistently 50% of the East Germans would be against it if Muslims rose in leadership positions,\n if their education data goes up and the fear, the better it goes for Muslims, the more demands they make, was also with almost every second president from the emancipation of women. The better it is for women, the more demands they make.\n It's also a common threat scenario.\n Finally, what I found interesting, you said that even East Germans internalized the stereotypes that exist about them in the West.\n How can you explain that? This is also from gender research.\n This is called internalized misogyny.\n That means that women internalize the stereotypes and\n prejudices that they are exposed to,\n with which certain privileges in society\n are also preserved. So let's take\n this normative idea. Article 3 in the\n Basic Law says that the rights of women are equal to the rights of men.\n And at the same time we look and see, well, there are only 30% women in the\n Bundestag, there are only 8% women in the DAX representatives and until March 17th\n all women in this country worked for free, because then there is the Equal Pay Day.\n That means we have a norm, a big norm, which probably everyone subscribes to.\n Everyone believes we in Germany have gender equality, in contrast to.\n And at the same time, the empirical reality is very different from that.\n And that creates something called cognitive dissonance.\n So if you believe in a norm, to stand very faithfully against it and to have it internalized,\n and at the same time the reality is different, then you are trying to balance it out,\n because of course that does not coincide with the self-image. And the balance is created either\n through resource mobilization, so all men who think they are emancipated could say,\n okay, I'll clear my space, which is of course a very difficult resource structure,\n or you explain it through stereotypes.\n That's the way it is because women don't really want to go there.\n Women can't lead, are very emotional,\n actually decided\n themselves to focus more on families, etc. So\n they are stabilizing stereotypes and many women also take this as a\n relief to explain that they actually have to put a lot of effort into\n to get into this position. We have seen that with East Germans too.\n Many of the stereotypes like East Germans always see themselves as victims\n or East Germans do not distance themselves from extremism or have not yet arrived,\n we have seen throughout the 20%, sometimes 25% of East Germans\n who have named this stereotype themselves.\n But how is that explained?\n Well, that is to explain that this is basically a form of passing.\n Passing means, there are different strategies, socially and psychologically.\n If you belong to a group yourself, i.e. to a negatively marked in-group,\n and are aware that this group is framed negatively,\n there are several ways to escape from this group.\n One way to escape from the group, the most common, is social mobility.\n That means I get up and show them,\n I do not confirm your stereotype.\n I have proven to you that I have risen.\n That is one possibility. Some people cannot pass.\n So if you are a black person in Germany and there are racist stereotypes against your group,\n you can still rise so much."

This paradoxical finding suggests that the stronger the integration of Muslim groups, the more defensive the integration discourse becomes. The study also revealed that East Germans internalize stereotypes about themselves, similar to the concept of internalized misogyny. This means that despite the normative idea of gender equality in Germany, the reality is different, and the cognitive dissonance created by this discrepancy is addressed through the stabilization of stereotypes. In the case of East Germans, stereotypes such as seeing themselves as victims, not distancing themselves from extremism, or not having arrived yet, were identified. This behavior can be explained as a form of passing, where individuals from negatively marked groups try to escape the group by proving that they do not conform to the stereotype or by internalizing the stereotype as a relief.",

I want to say another thing, which I find much more interesting because you didn't emphasize it.\n The exciting question, and I find that very interesting, is that even if 50% in the West say they feel like victims ...\n As a second class citizen.\n Yes, it's good that you say that.\n Unfortunately, it often comes together with that.\n This second class citizen, I'll get to that in a moment, is often connoted in the description of the East that they are victims of a Western...\n That's what the term means by now, we should talk about it, of Western colonization.\n In the West, it is obviously the same.\n And of course on a social split, in my opinion.\n That's the only explanation.\n That a social split runs across society,\n within which West and East are a special class of citizens.\n Now comes my problem with the matter.\n We are the East.\n There used to be a second the East. There was also a second generation East. It was partly a claim of equal rights by a fairly high class of the East,\n often a civil academic average.\n I don't want to say that it was about distinction fights within an academic class,\n about occupations. But they were people who could not have said for themselves, we are in the evaluation discourse.\n It establishes them, that's my problem, it establishes them a bit.\n You know, because you said it yourself, it is only spoken negatively about the East.\n That alone is already a description.\n I find that stereotypes are often also attached to good intentions.\n And I don't have the impression that only negative, even in the West, negative things are being said about the East.\n I think it's good that others make themselves visible, but you attach, and that's my problem,\n sometimes you attach the judgments that others make very strongly to identities, against which you might also be able to act. That's why I have this discomfort and I wanted to articulate it right away.\n That's one thing where I have the problem.\n Maybe Ms. Simon can say more about it.\n That we grew strongly into identities after 1989,\n in the East as well as in the West,\n which partly did not exist in the East before 1989.\n And I think that's a problem.\n That young generations make this topos their own.\n I don't think that's a political problem.\n I would like to clarify that, because that's your point of view.\n And it's very nice that you address that.\n Because you say that by calling it that, you give the East a certain identity and that is not right.\n That's exactly not what we want to do. So I'll say it again, we are the East is a\n provocation. That it is a reaction to the description of the right-wing Yamao Ossis,\n which was discussed everywhere again and again. And what we do is to\n take our arm and say, look who we are.\n And if you go to our website, maybe you've already looked a little bit.\n There are a lot of different stories, there are a lot of different people.\n And we want to show, above all, that there is no East."

By using the phrase \"We are the East,\" the group aims to provoke and make visible the diversity and complexity of East German identity, which was often overlooked or misrepresented after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The initiative also seeks to promote a whole Germany by attacking these first walls and stereotypes. The group recognizes the ambivalence of their identity as both distinct from and plural within the East, and they want to challenge the negative descriptions that have been attached to their identity. They believe that young generations have grown into these identities too strongly and that it is not a political problem, but rather a reaction to the persistent negative descriptions of the East in German society.",

And what I notice is that you\n already draw this line in your approach, from the beginning.\n But now there is research that says, okay, if we cluster society differently,\n namely with regard to value settings, then we don't see these differences that much.\n And that's what Maureen Cummins did.

But the very strong anti-Muslim debates have created a moment of, that's not the group that is described here,\n it does not correspond to my reality of life. I have to oppose something\n in opposition to that. And that's a bit of a narrative. Hannah Arendt once said,\n if you are attacked as a Jew, you have to put yourself in the defense as a Jew. It doesn't matter\n whether you describe yourself as one.\n The picture is in society and this picture leads to a performance.\n That's a theory by Judith Wattler.\n You perform on the calls that are given to you in society.\n And let it be just by saying that the calls are not right.\n But you don't destabilize the pictures yet.\n So you say that what we do has no added value in the end?\n Yes, yes, yes.

I would like to put something against it a little bit. So once\n I always had an discomfort that the East Germans were compared to migrants, because I think\n the East Germans had it easier than migrants. I have to say that they could sometimes use the same toothpaste in their same apartment or had to choose a new toothpaste.\n But they had not had such a foreign experience as a Muslim migrant, in my opinion.\n But that in particular sometimes made it difficult\n because you knew the same language and the same patterns\n and thought we are actually one, but we weren't.\n And that's why I find it very interesting with this.\n We are the East.\n It's also a bit ironic.\n You don't always have to take it so terribly bitterly seriously, but you can also say yes, we are the East. It's also a bit ironic. You don't have to take it so terribly bitterly serious,\n but you can also say yes, we are the East, but we also have other things.\n And what would be very important to me now is that there are also\n stereotypes from East Germans to West Germans.\n If you ask how the West Germans are seen, namely the better\n Wessis, who are capitalistic,\n always swimming on the wog and are completely idle, egocentric and what\n do I know everything is.

No, we're from the East.\n You're actually doing exactly the same.\n And that's why, if you were to criticize something,\n then it would be a criticism of yourself.\n And I think that would be...\n Let me just say something about that, Hans, very briefly.\n Actually...\n I just want to take that up. You just said something interesting.\n You just said something very interesting.\n You can't... I admit it. I'm a very serious guy.\n I want to understand my irony.\n All good.\n But you can't deny that in every...\n and not even in regionalization,\n but in a partialization,\n halving of the country,\n because the conflict goes through all the political debates,\n we know the standing debates about the question of who is willing to claim the color black, red, gold,\n who is not willing to start something with the color in the movement.\n There is of course more to it and that's why I was so sharp in this cementing of a split.\n And I find that a bit problematic.\n That's all, that's why I was maybe unfit for irony in the case, but I think,\n and that's the second thing I have to say, what I find ironic too, the\n registrations are happening, partly of course from the defense perspective,\n which I can understand. But they have been coming from the east for a long time.\n I don't think that the West would emphasize the classical regionalism much more.\n And that's why I was so unironical.\n They would say we are Bavarians, we are W\u00fcrttembergers, we are something else.\n It is fatally a move into the fortification.\n And I don't think that's just as ironic.\n The mirror made the fortation with the title picture.\n That's how the Ossi is.\n We're not talking about the mirror, we're talking about the fact how you react to it.\n That's just the point.\n I'm not talking to mirror editors.\n But it's my discomfort in a way that I thought,\n if you record it, you can at least articulate it.

And that's one thing that's very strong, the so-called othering, which Daniel Kubiak at the HAU Berlin also researched, who also works with Nike.\n He says, Germany is always West Germany. That's the case. And everything else that deviates from it is somehow a special case, a special case.\n And because of this experience, that you realize, okay, you always deviate a little bit from the norm, you create the identity that you actually have,\n namely, I am different somehow,\n and this feeling of being different somehow,\n that strengthens very strangely\n and then becomes stronger and stronger.\n And the other point that I want to address\n is the evaluation experience of parents,\n which is very well carried out.\n In our family, my parents were very strongly influenced by the Wende.\n Unemployment, they had great jobs and afterwards everything went down the drain, so to speak.\n And this evaluation, it characterizes you very strongly and you can see it very strongly in many in my environment.\n And I think to claim that you don't get it wrong,\n that's just not true.\n And I just read this very nice article by Alexander Osang in the Spiegel.\n He writes from Germany\n that it's a bit like the long-term wave that is finally going to grow out of Germany.\n With this picture, I would say\n it's good that this long-term wave is not yet growing out of Germany,\n because maybe it is also a chance, this inequality and injustice, this question of participation and opportunities,\n which still exists very strongly, that this generation maybe still has a sense for it and says,\n hey, we haven't reached this point for a long time.\n Yes, I find it very interesting, because I also believe that those born around this time\n are very influenced by their East German parents and partly East German teachers.\n And it's a generational experience and you can't just put it away."

And my generation told us that we, because we have so long of a dictatorship experience,\n could never become psychoanalysts.\n Because we are so shaped by authoritarian hierarchical structures,\n that we don't even have the ability to empathically understand others.\n We then proved that we could.\n And it's really about maybe looking again, what was actually\n an important experience in the GDR that is now somehow\n going down or is no longer there enough. And where you really have the feeling,\n I want to defend myself with my self-confidence.\n I had given myself the motto of always\n opposing this devaluation, always hold back this devaluation.\n Nothing else remains for you.\n And for example, what I found a very important GDR experience was that it was a working society\n in which you always had to deal with the other classes.\n You were in the uniform school system in my class there were workers, craftsmen, intellectuals, etc.\n up to the eighth grade. Then of course the choice was made who is allowed to go to the EOS and then some\n who were actually very well suited were unfortunately not allowed. Often the intellectuals and drivers' children were not allowed.

We had to be specialists at the same time.\n I had no other choice in the place where I was to become an electrician in the place where I was.\n I was extremely unsuitable for that.\n But I don't want to miss this experience of teaching, working with others, learning a craft work in my life.\n And also this, what it means to work in shifts. Or what it means, what we had in the studies, we always had to do internships,\n to get potatoes out of the field.\n So this experience of what certain work means without it being evaluated like that.\n And I also know that today from West German patients,\n who actually, when they come from the working class,\n always report very specific evaluations,\n which are foreign to me.\n Workers, who is more, was in the East.\n So that's an experience, for example,\n that I don't want to miss.\n I find that so exciting. Annette Simon said something very interesting.\n It overlaps with East and East always two phases of time.\n You just have to say that. You know, that's maybe a bit of a hook for me, and of course she's bringing her DDR-farm now, and you describe the East as a post-war East.\n And that it overlaps like that, I think that's also explanatory. That's maybe this defensive attitude.

The discussion revolves around the feelings of shame, devaluation, and declassification that East Germans, particularly those who have joined the AfD, experience. They feel that they should be integrated first before migrants and that the West German structures have excluded them. The migrants, on the other hand, may react to this hatred and feel that they are not involved in the process of integration and should not be denied a piece of the cake. The AfD's anti-elite and anti-stranger attitudes are seen as similar to the anti-Wesi (West German) attitude, as both target groups perceived as outsiders are subjected to these attitudes. The interview also highlights the importance of understanding the personal and social identities and how they interconnect.

That's a special thing, because as an East Berlinian you've never been so much of an Eastman.\n You could immigrate to the West without leaving his home.\n I would like to open the view a little bit.\n The peaceful revolution that we experienced in 1989 was not the only peaceful revolution.\n There were a few others.\n At that time, the neoliberal revolution began and the digital revolution started.\n I think that has something to do with each other.\n Germany, West Germany, where we came from, was no longer the good old comfortable Federal Republic, but it was a little different. I read an article today by Jana H\u00e4nsel, she explained the issue of East German presence to the English in the Guardian.\n I found the comments of the English readers interesting.\n One wrote that it is like in Northern England.\n You have the people who live in London and then you have the people in of England.

What will these revolutions leave behind for losers and how will they react?\n Because we see that in France, we see it in Poland, we see it in Austria.\n If you have this view, then we are European normality in Eastern Germany.\n And West Germany is actually the exception.\n Yes, as far as the numbers of the AfD voters are concerned, completely right.\n But I think it's getting very interesting now.\n If you take what you have done, I want it positive.\n I've understood it now, I've learned a lot.\n I say it quite unironically.\n Exactly.\n And that's what I think is high and what I think is highly interesting.\n Exactly in contrast to what you said, this group proves that there is no homogeneity in the East.\n But at the same time, it seems, that it is cemented.\n I don't want to write that down, because there are success biographies of the East.\n This thing you described is the clich\u00e9 that the AfD uses.\n And I find that so precarious.\n We are all victims in the East. We are the second class citizens.\n There are a number of people who have not understood the turn in the East as a loss story.\n So the normality is indeed in European conditions, I wrote about it, others too,\n is indeed that the AfD has over 20 percent.\n The West is far more abnormal in the European context.\n But it also consists of the fact that still% of the AfD still hasn't voted.\n And a large part, and that's the problem, is to homogenize the East,\n also as a victim story of the AfD couloir,\n which then causes the West, or rather against the new Germany,\n to make a front for the Revolutionary Front 2.0.\n And that's my problem.\n You can hear that.\n I have to ask you again, Ms. Simon.\n We're duping each other.\n I always have such great difficulties with duping.\n In the GDR, the SED comrades always duped each other."

There are completely different processes and completely different Easts.\n And I don't think the backlash is... Well, the West also votes for the AfD.\n This movement towards right-wing populism is European.\n It's not just an East German problem.\n And that's another a kind of labeling,\n only the East Germans vote right.\n That's not true either.\n It's a problem across Europe.\n And what would be so important to me,\n and what unfortunately is quite common,\n is that the East Germans argue with each other first.\n The old East Germans.\n The young ones don't have to, I think.\n But the old East Germans were in very different positions.\n And for example, a West 68er is three times closer to me than an ex-party secretary from the East.\n With this party secretary or this Stasi type, that's actually my old fine figure and not a generation of Westers with whom I understand myself much better now.\n So it's actually really about the GDR to be argued again, because we were in very different positions there,\n which were not brought to an end, the disputes, because then the West came so quickly and we were all made equal and all earned less.\n I would like to say something about that, because I have made the same experience.\n I always thought in the GDR, if I was to vote for a party, it would be like the Greens.\n And if I was to read a newspaper, it would have to be like the Taz.\n And then came the walls and for my first 100 euros I went to the next k and bought a Taz."

Clay in 1947-48 in Bad Nauheim\n and were something like a UNHCR in the early to mid-1960s,\n and secondly an exhibition space for persillic vases for former NS-compromised members\n from the academic community, who first wrote about the exhibition\n Unconcerned Nazi Justice of the SDS in 1959 and at the beginning of the 60s\n with things they had rediscovered as jurists and historians\n at Munich and other universities.\n This exhibition and the seminar examined a West German sub-nation\n that had to somehow arrange and which, according to the best, did it in a conformist, conformist way.\n But I have to go back to the Tegel airport, where I got in a taxi.\n As I said, I flew here on November 10th and the taxi driver\n cheered until Ernst Reuterplatz.

The speaker noted that there was a problematic forced solidarity and confrontation over the abduction of the parents, partly out of protection. The speaker also mentioned that this individualization process, which leads to individual discussions and questioning of the parents' actions, is exciting but difficult to carry out due to the devaluation of the parents and the immediate echo in the experiences of the 1968 generation. The speaker acknowledged that the GDR was an unjust state but noted the difficulty of leading a generational discussion about the parents' actions during that time. The discussion was related to the events of 1968 as the speaker mentioned that there was a similar problematic forced solidarity and projection of fascism on the USA during that time. The speaker also noted that the protest against the parents did not always take place individually and that the parents were evaluated, but the fascist state was sometimes projected onto the USA. The speaker suggested that this individualization process and questioning of the parents' actions is an important debate that needs to be held in the generations",

You have to look in Germany and look in Italy to see what's there.\n And then you can also see the similarities. I like to hear what you say to me, why European right populism is being elected.\n I'm curious what you say. But I think it also has to be looked at why this situation is in Germany.\n And there are also explanations that are related to the German and Eastern German development. And in Italy there will be specific explanations there.\n So that you look at what is in the respective country and then of course in general European.\n And I don't know in general European.\n Yes, you're right. It's always right, Ms. Neicker, that you say there is a systemic approach that has its justification.\n But to make it clear with another example, the development in 1968, which was a supposedly global revolution,\n as it was described as a world movement, nevertheless had extremely different variations in the different countries.\n So to give an example, and there is an interesting parallel,\n why did the states of Italy, Germany and Japan\n have this kind of radicalism\n in the terrorist movements?\n This also had to do with the past,\n their generation of the breakthrough.\n These are the three states,\n the trias, so to speak,\n who had the fascist strength.\n As global as it is global, it was immediately understood by the movement as world-moving.\n Of course, there were German moments of collapse in 1968, which are also to be explained.\n And I think, to make it clear, of course in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg we have a 15% AfD party."

I moved to Berlin in 1988, not myself, but my parents drove me there.\n And then I'm turning. I've lived and worked in Stuttgart for a long time, in Zurich.\n I know the Wessis, who drove here in the east, and the Ossis, who drove here in the west.\n The whole migrants, I was also one in Zurich, there are many people who come from all over the world and work,\n like here in Berlin by now.\n So I know the world quite well, even if I haven't seen all of them,\n but the people who come from the world.\n I have three points that I would like to address if I have the time.\n The first point, we are talking about 30 years of reunification,\n and we are only talking about the AfD, Nazis, right wingers.

They were disillusioned with the SED and the lack of attention paid to right-wing activities in the East. Bella Hanschans spoke to this crowd, urging them to take on the mantle of new rulers. However, it was noted that the AfD's strategy to establish a presence in the West, led by Gauland and Begin, was more successful in the West due to different issues and topics resonating with voters there. The speaker suggests that it is important to understand the specific strategies being used by the AfD in different regions to fully comprehend the danger they pose. The speaker also mentions that the left in Thuringia is unhappy with the AfD being labeled as the East Party, but if all parties voted normally, there would be no issue of reunification to discuss.

In the German context, the East and West have unique experiences of alienation, with people in the East feeling disoriented by the shift from the socialist system to capitalism. The authoritarian character is also a factor, as people who have a strong need for order and obedience may be drawn to right-wing extremist groups that promise to restore order and control in a chaotic world. The presence of racism, which was less of a topic in the East due to the lack of migrants, is also a significant factor.

                "And the big question for me about the future is, how we can communicate production and consumption,\n how do we see what needs exist, how are they defined and how do we make it as democratic as possible.\n Thank you, Benjamin.\n Thank you, Benjamin.\n Thank you for the thoughts. What I definitely want to say is that there were fewer migrants, but there was no less racism.\n Racism is not dependent on the number of migrants,\n just as antisemitism was never dependent on the number of migrants, just like\n antisemitism was never dependent on the number of Jews.\n That doesn't matter at all, these are just these systemic questions that we ask ourselves.\n So many people came in 2015 and that's why it all\n has increased. Then you just forget that Pegida sang all his songs in Dresden on the\n Christmas market in 2014. So you just have that Pegida sang all his songs on the Christmas market in Dresden in 2014.\n So you just have to understand that this rhetorical figure of the other exists without the other\n and has a function.\n And that we also know that especially in times of major change,\n people are basically receptive to this author authoritarian or authoritarian figure of the leader.\n And you just said it, the changeover, and that's the point from which I say,\n that's why we see it in so many countries at the same time.\n And that's why it's not a specificity, because in all these countries at the same time\n this moment of insecurity arises. in all these countries at the same time.\n You just called it climate. But we can also call it consumption behavior,\n digitization, globalization, isolation, etc. And that is of course something that\n is linear with this very strong neoliberal system that has just\n led to these discrepancies. And in these times when many people no longer know, the question you just\n asked, how will it be in 30 years, there were phases in history where\n one could have claimed that relatively linearly.\n This will happen, this will happen, this will happen, we are in the\n women's emancipation, so far, so far, so far, in five years we will be there, in ten\n years we will be there. Of course, so far, so far, so far. In five years we are there, in ten years we are there.\n Of course, it is not a linear narrative at the moment.\n People can't even say how it will look next year.\n No idea, we will break the GroKo together and possibly the AfD will come to power.\n So a lot of things that at the moment at least make a total break possible.\n This total break is not only in this political spectrum,\n but the total break is moving towards us,\n for example, with regard to the climate issue.\n That we need a total break in our lifestyle\n in order to put something back against it.\n And in this time, in which people are confronted with this non-answer,\n they are susceptible to people who give simple answers,\n who relatively specifically break down these answers.\n We create plurality, we create ambivalence,\n we create this whole insecurity by saying to you very clearly,\n if you think back to a homogeneous, pure, clear structure,\n in which everything was as it used to be,\n then you will feel better.\n And this point is just noticeable worldwide.\n I think you have wonderfully named the interaction of system and individual precisely, because it only works\n when people have a need for such answers. And why do people have such a need for leaders,\n for simple answers? Because other needs that they have are obviously not fulfilled. Then fears of their own are taken over and then systems work in this way.\n In structural offers that hit the resonance ground of individuals.\n And there are feedback processes between individual, society, structure.\n And I think we are not really apart at all, that there is this connection.\n The question is always who is looking at it from which perspective.\n I know that, or we know that Annette has to leave soon.\n We would, or I would like to know from you, we are talking about or have tried to talk about lost\n chances. If you look at the situation now, where all this is breaking up and be it due to a\n jubilee, what chance is there now that what didn't work well 30 years ago in the last 30 years\n went wrong, maybe it was done wrong because interests wanted it to be like that.\n What is the future perspective from your point of view,\n what was almost promised and hoped for 30 years ago,\n maybe now to get on track?\n I don't know."

Benjamin and Annette discussed how racism and antisemitism are not dependent on the presence of the targeted group, but rather a systemic problem. They also noted that in times of major change, people are more receptive to authoritarian figures and leaders. The causes of this shift can be attributed to various factors such as climate change, consumption behavior, digitization, globalization, isolation, and the neoliberal system. These factors have led to discrepancies and insecurities, making people more susceptible to simple answers and authoritarian figures. The need for such leaders arises when other needs and fears of individuals are not fulfilled, and systems capitalize on this vulnerability. The interaction between the individual, society, and structure creates a feedback loop, with individuals seeking answers from the system that resonate with their fears.

Her activism was also seen as a reflection of our collective bad conscience, as she challenges us to confront the need for change and take action. The interviewers expressed a desire for more thematicization of biographies and personal experiences in the context of missed opportunities for reconciliation and societal change.\nOverall, the interview highlighted the importance of recognizing the past, learning from it, and taking action to create positive change in the present and future.

If I have something that I inherit, it will not increase by giving it away.\n This inequality will continue to exist.\n This idea that this is something that is only transported as a feeling is exactly connected with the word Yamaoshi.\n Take a look at the city of Dresden. It's so beautiful now.\n Why are you still complaining? But in Hagen it looks completely different. So this\n idea that you can do something like that through money is maybe one side. The\n other is what you just said, this form of symbolic recognition. And there are\n already suggestions on how to do that. Petra K\u00f6pping, for example, suggested that something like a truth commission be founded.\n And in this form, first of all, it offers this room to recognize from the other side that\n a fundamental contribution has been made to this inequality, namely through the\n loyalty, which is now being worked up,\n but also through the collective declassification, through this not recognizing that an engineer\n can do this job well, but that this person is actually only needed at the moment\n when she is moving her job further down. So a classic undercutting of societies.\n And that might be one step, to actually work on this truth commission\n and to think about what is being said there.\n What can you get from all sides?\n There is then perhaps also the room to work on mutual stereotypes\n and get away from the idea that the whole thing is rooted in a psychological\n ailment, which is basically just sensitive.\n And I think that's something we can go into more detail about.\n In the study we did, we actually found one thing.\n This whole self-assessment, East Germans as second-class citizens\n or East Germans have to do more to achieve the same\n or do not have the same access to social positions.\n As I said, it's not a feeling, it's true, they don't have the same access to social positions.\n The West Germans don't see all of that at all.\n That means that while we have 50% of the East Germans who see this and say,\n yes, I don't have the same access to, or my social group doesn't have the same access to social positions,\n say that West Germans have just 18%.\n That means this blindness to it and this experience, interestingly enough,\n what often happens to me with this study,\n to be always addressed in the deepest West,\n is that still available in East and West German?\n So this narrative that everything is no longer there,\n while one group wants to point out that this inequality continues,\n I think that is also part of our problem.\n Just one sentence.

That came later.\n So that's why I understand, disinterest is a general hegemonic feature of Western culture that did not have to deal with the new one to that extent.\n The old one simply continued in the West.\n That sounds very logical, but it doesn't.\n In the data we actually found exactly the opposite.\n We have seen that the perception of the deprived situation\n towards Muslims in the West is very high.\n So very high, yes.\n I didn't just mean Muslims, it's interesting that you always bring it to Muslims.\n But I think that's your experience, you have other experiences that go beyond the studies."

That came later.\n So that's why I understand, disinterest is a general hegemonic feature of Western culture that did not have to deal with the new one to that extent.\n The old one simply continued in the West.\n That sounds very logical, but it doesn't.\n In the data we actually found exactly the opposite.\n We have seen that the perception of the deprived situation\n towards Muslims in the West is very high.\n So very high, yes.\n I didn't just mean Muslims, it's interesting that you always bring it to Muslims.\n But I think that's your experience, you have other experiences that go beyond the studies.\n I mean the perception of the guest worker, the integration difficulties of the struggle of those who came new to the country.\n I think there was a disinterest because they did not belong to normal society,\n only had to work hard and that first in the second, third generation.\n I didn't mean the Muslim people.\n I don't mean to contradict you, that's in the second, third generation. That's what I meant. I didn't mean the Muslims. Interesting, anyway, when you say...\n I don't mean that to contradict you,\n that's not the point,\n but because I think that there is\n a very exciting narrative factor in it.\n How come that in Western Germany\n there is a very high sensitivity\n for the worse situation of migrants,\n or in this case of Muslims, but not at all for the worse situation of migrants, or in this case of Muslims,\n but not at all for the worse situation of East Germans.\n And I think that's because of this narrative that\n what can't be, can't be.\n So the idea that you should treat your own brothers\n the same way is so firmly anchored in your head\n that you don't want to admit it,\n that you haven't done it. And that's why you're hiding it.\n Well, I have to say one more thing. I just have to say that. Of course, it is not like there is no other narrative of the West,\n which says that an incredible amount has been done. You shouldn't forget that.\n It is, it is, it is existent. And purely purely monetarily, the number of billions that have flown away\n under the conclusion that the West has received an enormous\n conjucted boost through the new consumer mass that the East is growing.\n The latter is not present, the latter is fully present.\n So the feeling, you have been doing this all the time.\n You have seen this exemplary in the debate about the solidarity strike.\n There has been solidarity in the West and East for years, also under the pretext that the East also has solidarity strikes.\n This is of course a counter-narrative, which ultimately overlaps this other question.\n And in this respect, you could also suppress it a little bit.\n I think that disinterest is actually there to some extent.\n I just read yesterday that 17% of West Germans have never been in the East.\n We see that in the quotas, in radio shows, in YouTube shows that I do.\n The topic of the East is not particularly interesting and there will be a reason why the time has shown the most important East Germans only in the East.\n The question is, of course, how can you change that or how can you get a hearing?\n I think an important way or an important step is now happening, namely that the third generation speaks openly about it.\n That's one point. But maybe it's also the question of how you can do it politically.\n And maybe the problems we're having right having are also a chance in a certain way because suddenly these also have to be considered in\n general German. We have in the Federal Chancellor's Office the Digital Minister is\n assigned to the migration, but the East Commissioner is under the\n Ministry of Economy.\n The question is whether he actually belongs to the Federal Council.\n That's also the question, what they do.\n But yes, I'm completely with you.\n We're going to do a quick round with our, I think we still have a handful of word messages. You have two to three minutes each and then we'll do our final round.\n Paul, you have this podcast, right?\n Do you advertise your podcast?\n Do you advertise my podcast?\n Respublica.\n Podcast.\n And Paul also works for Jung & Naiv.

However, there is a lack of interest or awareness towards the worse situation of East Germans. This is attributed to the deeply ingrained narrative that what cannot be, cannot be, and the feeling that the West has always treated its own people the same way. The speakers acknowledge that there are counter-narratives that highlight the significant contributions of the East to the West, but the topic of the East is not particularly interesting to many West Germans.

You couldn't speak problems openly and honestly the madness of the Maybe someone in the audience feels like they're being talked to and says, yes, that's how it is with us.

Or we take the can bags with us again.\n That's not an issue.

And I think there is always a difference between what we expect, what we believe and what will happen.\n And I think that's the point. We try to work on the topic of the East and West all the time.\n But we can't do more.\n I think we can hardly\n look into the future and expect\n that what we try to do will also be implemented.\n And the most important thing is,\n like here, you talk about it,\n you can't expect that what we say,\n what is there for a chance, where can we go in, where can we now say, get in and do that, it will not be so implementable,\n that you have that awareness.

They also advocated for wealth redistribution and representation closures as potential solutions. Thilo specifically mentioned the idea of an East quota and symbolically showing trust in the East German population by putting them in office. He also expressed his skepticism towards appeasement and believed that radical demands and active rebellion might be necessary to bring about change.

That the East was deregulated\n was immediately in total German number as a CO2 reduction\n flew to the surface. That means it could be to some extent on the\n deregulation of the East of the West to survive.\n And today this time is over and that's why I see the exciting question that one of the competitors brought in here,\n not in the identity politics, I see it in the question of democracy.\n I see it in the question of who is willing to either abstain from those who have been or, that's the drama,\n more right-wing from the election? We have seen in all East elections\n that the right can activate people to the fullest extent. The big question is,\n do we get people to activate them in the positive, in the progressive direction over the climate issue?\n Or do they wander into the blockade attitude described by you?\n We are shitting ourselves off, so retrotopia with Baumann, Sigmund Baumann, so AfD.\n Or one that says we have to participate productively.\n And that is, I think, the exciting question that all of us face, east and west.\n If we do not prepare the people for an incredible transformation,\n which can not only remain national, but which is so immense that it places everything far into the shadows of what has happened here in the last 30 years,\n then we will probably have to deal with very hard discussions that in fact then, the friend, is the actual question.

The speaker argues that the East's deregulation led to significant CO2 emissions, which in turn made it seem as though the West was making greater strides in reducing emissions. This allowed the West to maintain its economic advantage, but it also meant that the potential for collaboration and mutual benefit was missed.\n\nRegarding the impact of the climate crisis on the West's identity and democracy, the speaker sees it as an exciting question that concerns the entire country and even Europe. The speaker believes that if the people are not prepared for the transformation required to address the climate crisis, there is a risk of hard discussions and potentially divisive political attitudes. The speaker suggests that the right-wing parties in the West have the ability to activate people in large numbers, and it is crucial to engage people in the positive, progressive direction to address the climate issue.

I don't know you, can you introduce yourself?\n Yes, I am Adolf Bauer, I am president of the German Social Association, short SOVD.\n It has been around for 100 years, but under a different name.\n In 1917 this association was founded as a Reichsbund.\n Victims of war and those who survived the war founded an association\n to help people who were damaged return to life as victims of war or as survivors of war,\n to help these people to their right.\n And this kind of work is what keeps us busy and keeps us going until today.\n We have been researching for 100 years.\n I have been the chairman of this association for 12 years and I still feel very well after these 12 years.\n Because we don't lose our jobs. That is good on the one hand, but it also shows that it is not well ordered in our state when people still have to fight for their rights.\n Do you have to? You have to, because our laws are either so complicated that people don't understand them,\n or they are so poorly made that the scope of interpretation in the authorities is so large that people often don't get their rights,\n or many people don't even know what rights they have at all.\n And we then try to give them this information, or we try to help them with the application.\n Or when it comes to negative results, to formulate contradictions for them.\n We also complain for them or with them, together in front of the social courts.\n Or if it gets really bad, we go to the social courts on the state or federal level.\n And in the worst case, we also try to change the laws, when the legislator,\n and we are sitting here in front of the Reichstag\n or the German Bundestag, when the legislator\n has worked so sluggishly that the laws\n do not have any content from the Constitutional Court.\n Give me an example.\n For example, there is this pension law,\n we have sued it several times,\n the zero rounds, we don't always have success with it,\n but we try anyway.\n You mean that pension rates have not been increased?\n That no pension increases have been made over the years, there are still lawsuits.\n Sometimes the Federal Constitutional Court, the pension legislator or the government says\n that there is a very broad range of decisions and it can decide that there is nothing to be done,\n even though prices are rising, even though wages are rising.\n Pensioners who receive an average of under 1,000 euros in pension anyway, they don't need more, says the legislator.\n And you mean that this has to be increased every year?\n Normally, the pension should be adjusted, just like the wages.\n But we have been away for a long time.\n The pension increases are disconnected from the wage development.\n And that was politically intended.\n We deliberately reduce the pension.\n Why?\n Why? Yes, so that you save the contributions.\n Or so that the employer's share is not too high.\n That was a crucial criterion.\n Or so that you think that you will still get a pension in 20 years from which they could live.\n But then you lower the level from now to 50 to 43% in the future.\n And then we know that many pensioners and many people live in poverty\n and have to live below the basic security level.\n That means they have worked their whole life and have paid into the pension insurance.\n In the end, they don't stay much longer than those who have never paid into the pension insurance.\n If I know that, then I can tell myself why I would work if I would get the same result at the end of my working life as if I had worked. I think you are not sitting here because you are bored, but because you need a job, you need confirmation and people need work.\n This is also part of self-realization.

And that's why it was the most important time that we introduced a minimum wage.\n Why didn't Germany have a minimum wage? We were the role model for a social state.\n We are not role models in many areas.\n No?\n No, not at all.\n For a long time, the Japanese were presented as the example.\n That was with one of the previous governments.\n In the meantime, the Japanese standard is one that we absolutely do not need.\n Why? Because it does not meet our standards, but it is oriented at very low levels.\n And we have to ensure that someone who works full-time can also live from the salary he gets for it.\n Exactly.\n And that's 8.50 euros, whether it's here in Berlin, whether it's in Munich, whether it's in Hamburg, it doesn't matter.\n You can't live from 8.50 \u20ac per hour in the normal case.\n Then you have to have a second job, then all family members have to work, women and men.\n Then the family life comes under the wheels, then you can't raise the children adequately, etc.\n There are many points that are still significantly improvement worthy for us.\n The height of the minimum wage is one thing, I have now learned that not everyone gets the minimum wage, right?\n Also that we have far too many exceptions to the minimum wage.\n For example? The younger people, students, long-time unemployed,\n exactly the people who often need it, they have been excluded.\n Why is that?\n There are more examples that you exclude those who would have it most necessary.\n And in that respect, why?\n The reason would be that someone from politics would have to deliver.\n I think that's absurd, what they have decided to do, partly on the basis of exceptions.\n You just said it yourself, those who would need it most, to get such a minimum wage, don't get it.

Why not?\n Because they thought that their chances of reintegration into the labor market would be worse.\n But we have had such like this in the past.\n Whether it was about equality between women and men,\n whether it was about equality between men and women,\n we had that for many decades.\n And women were not allowed to decide alone.\n They were not allowed to go shopping alone.\n They had no key power.\n That lasted 20, 30 years after the Second World War.\n That's how long we had equality.\n Nevertheless, women had less rights.\n Today it is still the case.\n We argue about the quota regulation in the supervisory meetings.\n We argue for the same wage, for the same work for women and men.\n Equal PD is the general term for it.\n No, that's not self-evident for us that self-employment is still being implemented.

You know that the results are not what you hoped for.\n No, the support school for the disabled does not bring the results like inclusive education.\n I started myself at a small school and I also had children with disabilities in my class.\n And it turned out, that was 50 years ago,\n that these children with disabilities\n were not noticed at all within the class community.\n The children without disabilities, supposedly without disability,\n because I'm sure if you investigate thoroughly, we all have a disability somewhere.\n I have a visual disability, for example. You too?\n You too? Me too. I also have a visual disability. I also have other disabilities, but we shouldn't talk about that.

            "reference_answer": "\nThe historical reason for the different salary groups for primary, high school and university professors in the German education system can be traced back to the early 20th century when the education system was still divided based on social class. The civil service was organized differently than in the class society, and teachers were paid according to their qualifications and professional training. Primary school teachers had a shorter training period than high school teachers, and high school teachers had better chances for higher salaries due to the longer training period and the need for a student referral. This differentiation in salary groups was justified based on the different educational requirements and working conditions.\nHowever, with the shift towards more inclusive education in schools and society, this division and differentiation are no longer considered acceptable. The general schools still exist, but the training regulations for the different school forms are being adjusted.

The hindsight may explain some things, but it shouldn't bother us too much. Can you explain the difference between inclusion and integration?\n Oh yes. The term integration is the older one.\n It was shaped in the effort or expectation that people who have a restriction\n adapt in such a way that they are no longer noticeable.\n This means that a one-sided demand was made to people with disabilities.\n Inclusion means that society achieves the prerequisite that everyone has the same opportunities. So the focus is not on the limitations,\n but on the possibilities of participation.\n What can someone do? Where does he have his strengths?\n What strengths can he exploit? How can he integrate?\n And what conditions do we have to create so that he can do that?\n So, to stay with our example on the stairs here,\n integration would have meant how do I change the person so that he can get up this stairs,\n if it has to be on his hands and feet, and inclusion means how do I create it,\n how do I change it so that he can still get up here with his disability. That means\n here we have the long way around, it is still a disadvantage, but it is an attempt to avoid exclusion.\n But will you be able to abolish any disadvantages, no matter what life conditions?\n No, you won't be rid of them. You are older than me, so you have some disadvantages compared to me and you have some advantages that I don't have.\n That's right. We are different and being different is normal.\n There are exhibitions, the SOVD has developed an exhibition together with the Federal Council for the Germany, where it becomes clear that it is normal to be different.\n One is blond, the other is dark-haired, one is tall, one is small, one is fat, one is thin.\n We have women, we have men, we have children, we have adults, we have children, we have old people, we have young people.\n Being different is normal.\n And this diversity will still increase with us,\n when we see that at the moment several hundred thousand people from South Europe, Africa or Asia are coming to us,\n then this diversity will continue to grow.\n This was a gain in the past and it is a gain if we bring together different people,\n if different cultures can influence and fertilize each other."

What else is there\n when they go where you hope you can still get fed.\n And if someone flees with his family because the children are\n threatened to starve, then you don't have to insult and defame them either. So from\n therefore we will not get around our efforts, also in the countries from which people\n come from hunger. And if you then take the Balkan states as a pattern, you have known for a long time that the conditions there are miserable.\n You just put your hands in the shoes and hoped that others would take care of it.\n Are there safe origin?\n Well, they are ...\n I have just learned that, they are safe, they do not need asylum here.\n Although there is the Federal Guard, for example. They are safe, they don't need asylum. Even though they are the federal government.\n These are cases of conflict.\n The so-called safe-of-sufficiency countries,\n if you assume that you don't kill them right away,\n then that may be the case.\n These countries in which civil war-like conditions prevail,\n are not, in my opinion.\n These are countries where people flee from fear for their lives and their families.\n If we offer them a real chance here, if we let them work,\n if we offer them jobs, then they would not burden us financially.\n We also have to take into account that many people who come to us,\n at least for a quarter of a year and some even longer, are not allowed to work.\n They are not nameless trolls who come to us,\n but they are people with a professional qualification, with an academic education.\n There are doctors, there are teachers, there are engineers. They are not allowed to work, even though they actually want to.\n They have to be able to learn the language and then they will be applicable to us.\n But we do a lot too little in this area to really integrate them into society,\n to help them get out of their misery.\n Because they want to work. There are many young people.\n That's the next point. There are many young people who come to us.\n They are not pensioners, but when you see what is being saved on the ground by people,\n these are mostly young people, families with children.\n And it is unimaginable how our society has looked at this over the years and basically done nothing.\n We can do that, others can do that.\n Our European neighbours are no better at making that clear.\n But that doesn't have to be an example for us, that others do nothing to see for themselves.\n That's the sand box principle at the moment.\n Yes, we're taking so much on, but the others don't do anything.\n Or the Florian principle. Let others do it.\n St. Florian, save my house, incite others.\n That can't be a scale for our trade.\n And in that respect, I've lost the thread a bit now.\n I have to think about where I was."

With inclusion, society is more challenged to change the conditions in such a way\n that people with disabilities also have a real chance to participate.\n With integration, it was very clear that one had strong expectations\n for adaptation from the affected and the society has\n leaned back a little more. You have created the things, the special facilities,\n the support opportunities, but at the same time you have not changed that much yourself\n and the conditions have not changed that much. An inclusive society cannot afford to exclude people,\n to no longer participate in society.\n And that means that on all levels,\n in construction measures, in public transport,\n in training courses, in the design of the workplace, in the design of education in kindergarten, in school, in universities.\n The changes are made in such a way that everyone can achieve the same results under the same results. Let's talk about inclusion in schools.\n Does that mean that no one is disabled or that everyone is disabled?\n No, people are taught with and without disability in one group\n and with different requirements, individual requirements, or with individual funding measures.\n That would have been the question.\n So inclusive school is one thing, but do you have a common teaching or do you just go to the same school together?\n You go both ways.\n I was in America for example, in a high school, it's quite normal. In high school everyone goes to school together.\n But people with disabilities still usually have a class together.\n It should also be in an inclusive class. There is additional teachers or therapists or psychologists or in a class, visual disability, hearing disability or something else, who can take up these specific forms of disability\n and then take up the support of these children within the normal class accordingly.\n So you say joint teaching?\n Yes, joint teaching and still inner differentiation within the classroom.\n This can mean that you go into another room for a while in individual cases.\n But it can also mean that this additional person of more power remains in the class association.\n This has the advantage that a child who supposedly has no disability, but in a special point, when reading, in mathematics, I know which case,\n suddenly has such a small deficit.\n So then this special force can take care of this child too.\n And with that, this child would also have an additional individual support in the normal association\n and would not need to fall back at all,\n not at all. And that is also a principle in the small-divided school,\n the so-called helper principle. We had several years in the small-divided schools.\n I myself have experienced first to eighth grade in one class. You can hardly imagine.\n But there was. You mean, you go together from the first to eighth grade in one class. You can hardly imagine. You mean, you go together from the first to the eighth grade in one class?\n In one room.\n In one room. Eight years.\n Eight years.\n Eight school years. First year, five children. Second year, three children. Third year, six children.\n There was something like that? There was something like that. In rural regions there were few or non-divided schools.\n One class school.\n First to eighth year in one room.\n And then Fritz from the fourth year supported Otto from the second year.\n Because Otto could not read well, Fritz trained with him.\n And Inge from the third school year supported Ute from the fifth year of school,\n because Ute still didn't master the one-by-one in the fifth year.\n So there was age-appropriate mutual support and encouragement.\n Then I would ask now, why did Ute even get into the fifth grade,\n if she still didn't have the one-by-one?"

However, it does not necessarily mean that the educational environment is adapted to meet the unique needs of these students. In some cases, additional support personnel may be provided to help students with disabilities keep up with their peers, but the focus is on the students adapting to the existing educational system rather than the system adapting to their needs.\nInclusion, on the other hand, involves making fundamental changes to the educational environment to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities, can fully participate and achieve the same results. This may include providing individualized support and accommodations, modifying the curriculum, and adapting the physical environment. In an inclusive classroom, additional support personnel, such as teachers, therapists, or psychologists, may be present to provide targeted support to students with disabilities, but the focus is on creating an environment where all students can learn together in the same classroom.\nIn terms of the role of additional support personnel, integration may involve having these personnel work with students in",

This is certainly a problem again with the mobility that is demanded by employees,\n employees, employees, that suddenly the father or the mother is displaced\n and the child stays seated, as it was said in Sp\u00f6ttisch, because it was not possible,\n the individual federal states were not managed to meet their requirements.\n The federalism reform has led to further stumbling blocks,\n that the federal states insist on it, and the Constitutional Court has just confirmed that.\n With the support fund, it is something that the federal government is not allowed to do this,\n and that the federal government has to do it, or can do it, if they want to.\n The federalism discussion leads us to the conclusion that a very this federal system for 60 years, 65 years, 70 years.\n And in some areas it is also very fruitful when such a competition between the different federal states exists.\n But where do you say federal states that are really good at inclusion?\n At the moment Bremen, Hamburg, the city states are partly leading.\n There are federal states, I don't want to name them now, that are at the very end,\n they think they don't have to do anything.\n There is a very wide, very wide range in the effort to implement inclusion in the school area.\n But I would like to emphasize that this is not limited to the school area alone.\n We have to assume that inclusion is a topic that concerns us in all areas, in all age levels, in all forms of life and realities.\n Here you have great buildings.\n Opposite I see the stairs up there.\n But I can't see if there is a wheelchair behind the stairs\n that someone with a disability can ride up.\n I don't think so.\n The entrance area is on the other side via the person control.\n And that's not a publicly accessible building.\n But nevertheless, it will take a generation until we have implemented something like this.\n It's not possible from today to tomorrow.\n And one more question, where we now stay with the inclusive school.\n Are the teachers actually trained for this?\n Or does the training of the teachers have to be different?\n The training of the teachers is also necessary.\n And it has not been taken into action until a couple of years ago.\n The countries have not adapted the training courses for teachers accordingly.\n In the future, all teachers must also complete an inclusion training course.\n But this is not only for teachers.\n Architects should actually also know how to build barriers.\n Road builders, vehicle builders, machine builders.\n This is a topic that concerns everyone and I cannot limit this to the school area.\n Inclusion is really a continuous principle and that will not be from today to tomorrow.\n You will also have these old buildings or the new buildings that you built five years ago\n and did not take into account that you also have to make people with severe disabilities must also be allowed access.\n You can't tear it down.\n The historic buildings will not be made accessible to everyone from now on.\n The monument defenders are still ahead, first of all.\n And then there is ethics against and so on and so forth. We have to be careful that we then take the inclusive thoughts into account.\n But it's not always the end of the thread. Even if it hurts, we will still have to take some things into account.\n And when I look into the future, when I see what is happening in Europe at the moment,\n if I see that unemployed people, long-time unemployed people are allowed to retire in advance,\n if they have become 63 without wanting to, the Federal Social Court has decided again.\n If I see how we treat, how some some people do, then the demand for action is much greater than we expected.\n Nice conclusion, Adolf.

To put it briefly.\n But satire is also part of art.\n I think we have time, I'll go on.\n Yes, yes, yes. What was your dream job? Exactly, to put it briefly. But satire is also art. I think we have time, I'll go on.\n Yes, yes, yes. What was your dream job?\n I didn't have a dream job actually. It was more or less something that happened to me.\n I wanted to do art, sat in the studio and waited for someone to come by and discover the things or bring them somewhere where they are shown. I'm a child of an official and was surprised that I had to organize all of this myself.\n Actually I couldn't do it and then we went on stage together,\n at six, at four, because people asked me, to be honest, if I wanted to take part.\n So it wasn't my initiative.\n And then I stayed alone and that was the time when I learned that my own initiative helps.\n That was like that. I was already in my mid- the time when I learned that self-initiative helps. I was already in my mid to late 20s when I learned that.\n When was that?\n The 90s.\n You were already 30 then. I was born in the 80s and in the 90s I was older, I think.\n Until I learned that my own initiative must be the drive, I was already over 30.\n But you had to be guided by someone who found you funny and that's what they asked you about.\n I think that's how it went, yes, essentially.\n And then I was left alone because I continued and then I realized that this is a job, that people gave me money for it.\n And suddenly I could live from the nonsense we did and that was great.\n Why were you the only one left?\n Because we lost more and more people on the way who thought that this was not a serious activity that we are doing there,\n which it was not either. And then we were together and then we had different ideas\n of how it should go on. We did a bit with hats and thick glasses and\n fall over on stage, so a lot of unhappiness. And I wanted to tell a little more. And that's what I did.\n And by chance, that was not my own initiative,\n but it was a Turkish theater operator from M\u00f6nchengladbach,\n who runs the theater Kervan.\n And he said, you have to do something, you just have to tell.\n Leave all the shit out.\n And I didn't think it was possible to just stand on a stage and tell.\n And he pushed me to try it out and that's what I'm still doing today.\n But there was already a cabaret before, right?\n Yes, but not this classic stand-up comedy, which was then called stand-up comedy, was rather unusual for Germany at the time.\n Everything that was cabaret was a lot of ensemble cabaret, a lot of scenic playing and all that.\n So what we did when we were four or two.\n And stand-up comedy with gags and falling down and so on, was that your case?\n Or did you start like that and then you got the idea that you could do it?\n No, when I was on my own, that was actually the form I'm doing today.\n Get up, think loudly, put something in the room, see what happens.\n Why did you pay you for it?"

In the 90s, when he was already over 30, he discovered that he could live from his nonsensical performances and found an audience. However, he lost collaborators along the way due to differing ideas about the direction of their performances. A Turkish theater operator from M\u00f6nchengladbach named Kervan, who ran the theater of the same name, encouraged Dieter to focus on just telling stories and leave the gimmicks behind. Dieter was skeptical but eventually gave it a try and has been doing stand-up comedy in this style ever since.

When the founding of the Greens, I looked at it, there is the founding preamble.\n Really? You have more on it than me.\n In the introduction to the Green's Basic Program, when you co-founded it, it says, In Bonn, established parties act as if an infinite industrial production increase is possible on the finite planet Earth.\n This leads us to our own statement before the hopeless decision between nuclear city and nuclear war.\n The ecological world crisis is getting worse day by day, the raw materials are getting smaller.\n Slowly, slowly. That's actually the interesting thing. It's written that at the beginning, growth was only imaginable in industrial production.\n And it is also included that they had no knowledge that the world would digitize, that growth in the service sector could take place on a digital level.\n All these things are not included. The world has changed incredibly far.\n But we were of course of the opinion that the industrial growth process would bring the earth to a limit.\n And that is also the case. That is objectively correct.\n And it is still the case.\n Of course.\n We still haven't managed to decouple economic growth from the use of resources and CO2 emissions.\n That seems to be the challenge.\n Yes, who are we? That's the key question.\n That's what I like to point out again.\n It's not that we don't have an environmental problem, but that we have a problem to have access to these problems.\n Oh God, how embarrassing is that? I still have my watch on. Terrible. How unprofessional.\n That we have no access to these problems, because these problems are now elsewhere in the world, than with us. And if the green basic program says today that they want to limit the global climate,\n the global warming to 1.5 degrees, then I have to laugh a little bit about it, because it's just that\n there is still this kind of self-assessment that we had in the 70s, that we thought at that time\n Europe is the center of the world and that everything was controlled by Europe.\n Now we have it in our hands to control this planet in a different direction.\n And of course we don't have that anymore.\n In China, I think, 220 or 215 new airports will be built in the next 15 years. And then it's not productive for me to think about how we are now regulating our traffic here in Germany.\n But it is important to ask the question, how can we influence what is going on in the world.\n These are world-political problems.\n And back then it was a national problem. Back then it was perceived like that, although it was always the green planet, it was always the topic, but back then you still had this Eurocentric view of things.\n I always read about world crises.\n Yes, economic world incredible self-examination of the need to save the world, that's a memory of my childhood that I still look at with a certain pleasure.\n But someone has to start.\n This attitude of saving the world that we had back then. Of course someone has to start.\n But I mean, the Greens nowadays are more with this 1.5 degree demand.\n That's a conservative demand, because that's already been determined by this Paris Climate Protection Treaty.\n All governments in the world are obliged to do so.\n And the Greens just say, yes, if the Greens become radical, they could say, we'll make one degree or so.\n What would make sense to do that?\n It's good that way. I'm not criticizing the 1.5 degree goal.\n I think it's achievable, but I think the attitude's naive to think that you could regulate it or drive it politically without thinking about power issues.\n Power issues are regulated in this world by military and economic power.\n That's hard power.\n And there's also soft power.

Poverty can't disappear as long as poverty is measured in percentage.\n Poverty can't disappear.\n But absolute poverty also means that people have what is guaranteed in Germany, namely food, heating, housing, clothing, education, medical care for everyone.\n And in this respect, the definition used by Xi Jinping in Germany is not poverty. I looked at it, there are not many official demands from Fridays for Future. One is to keep the climate targets 1.5 degrees from Paris, then net zero emissions.\n I don't think you can simply summarize the demands because they are already incredibly many layers and because there are no uniform points of course. The Fritz & F\u00fctter has a unified demand, that's four pieces. Paris, net zero until 2035, coal exit until 2030 and 100% renewable energy until 2035.\n Then there is a unified organization that everyone agrees with, who stood on the course there are an incredible number of points of view, I think, among the people who were there on Fridays on the street.\n Just like with us in the past, that's also clear.\n But I mean, you can argue wonderfully about that. We are probably all agreed on that, You also said 1.5 degrees. And you can make fun of the solutions or say it's nonsense.\n But the goals are, we are all agree on that.\n I didn't make fun of it.\n That's not something I would argue, no, I'm for 3 degrees or something.\n I don't understand the appeal.\n But you know how it comes out when you say the demands of Fridays for Future,\n when you think of them to the for Future are leading to catastrophe.\n It was about the discussion that industrial production has to be restricted, that globalization has to be stopped, that it has to be made retroactive.\n Because back then it was about globalization. Back then it was about free trade and this free trade is the condition that the whole world has risen from poverty. And the logic I was thinking was that if we stop this free trade, or believe in it,\n first of all it is completely unrealistic to believe that we from Germany or Fridays for Future would be able to stop globalization. But if that were possible, then of course\n those people who have just risen from poverty would not be accepted.\n Luisa Neubauer was already a guest."

            "reference_answer": "The Fridays for Future movement has several demands regarding climate change and industrial production. They aim to keep the climate targets of 1.5 degrees Celsius from the Paris Agreement, achieve net zero emissions, exit coal by 2030, and have 100% renewable energy by 2035. However, the movement has a diverse range of opinions, and these demands may not be uniform among all participants. The discussion in the interview revolved around the potential catastrophic consequences of implementing these demands, particularly the restriction of industrial production and the stoppage of globalization. It was argued that such actions would be unrealistic and could potentially lead to increased poverty, as many people have recently risen from poverty through globalization and free trade.",

I've never heard that you want to stop globalization.\n I think it's more about the CO2 emissions. We can't talk about that.\n How can transport and trade make CO2 free?\n Transport and trade make CO2 free?\n I think that's a task that many people are working on right now.\n Especially when it comes to shipping.\n Many people are working on it. I think it's totally fine.\n That's why I don't understand where the criticism lies.\n I don't understand where the catastrophic consequences of this demand should be.\n That's completely torn apart. You can't say that I would have said that the prevention of climate targets has catastrophic consequences.\n I didn't say that. I said in the interview\n context that I think if the naive demand for the interbind of global trade\n would be successful, it would have catastrophic consequences. Of course it would. If you\n now say we would have to stop everything that is climate-technically counterproductive,\n then we would of course have a huge problem, let alone that China would take part.\n As I said, China is currently building 215 airports.\n And in this respect I think the demand is naive, first of all. And secondly, if it were to go through, then it would have catastrophic consequences.\n Because it would send an incredible number of people, probably billions of people, back to the poor.\n That's not a particularly profound logic. And that's just a fact.\n If we would stop right now, of course, but you can imagine, okay, how do we do that in 20, 30...\n Yes, but that's what we're all working on.\n Massive work is being done on the climate goals, on the Paris climate goals.\n So if you have Peter Altmaier sitting here, two weeks ago two weeks ago, he has already given up 1.5 degrees.\n He also prevents the expansion of all possible renewables.\n I'm not sure about the 1.5 degrees.\n The constitutional court has to judge and the federal government has to rub its climate protection laws and who are rubbing their noses.\n Which law of this federal government did not end up in Karlsruhe because it is formulated in a flawed manner?\n I think we have a problem in the last decades that lawyers formulate flawed laws.\n I think we have that in all areas. In my opinion it was about the goals being clearly formulated, that the measures should be formulated more clearly after 2030.\n I think that's completely fine. Now everyone is happy that the constitutional court has denied it. I think that's very strange again.\n Why?\n Because the people who make laws are happy when the constitutional court takes them back.\n That has something of comedy for me.\n That was the absurd, Altmaier and Scholz who brought this thing on the way, saying we actually wanted a lot more.\n There is a certain absurdity there.\n But I found it interesting from a political point of view that constitutional judges say that parents are responsible for their children.\n And the federal government didn't notice that.\n That our generation is responsible for the generation after that. Yes, the argumentation honestly surprised me.\n Because this is the first time that a court says that those who are now responsible for those who still come,\n for people of the right who are not yet in the world, that also surprised me.\n But I think the consequence that follows is good.\n Yes.\n In that sense.\n The regional parties...\n I didn't understand it legally, to be honest.\n We don't have to talk about it now.\n Because it's my legal...\n I was surprised by everything I know about legal matters, that it was handled like that."

Yes, alternative was called that at the time.\n The word was then also disproved later.\n Too bad actually.\n Do you make fun of everyone?\n Pardon?\n Do you make fun of everyone and everyone?\n Actually yes.\n Harald Schmidt once said he makes fun of nobody who earns less than 20,000 euros a year.\n Do you have a limit? I thought that was a joke back then.\n No, I don't know. I think humor can make people laugh.\n There was always a humor that made people laugh outside.\n About their spying or something.\n And when people played housemaster,\n who stood somewhere with a kettle and told reactionary things,\n then that was also making fun of people of the people,\n people who don't make much money.\n For me that's not the category.\n I think it's also about humor.\n And humor is first of all something anarchist.\n Why?\n Because humor is first of all something destructive. Because it takes things more seriously.\n In that sense, humor is indeed a difficult thing. A weapon somewhere.\n And not everyone can do that. Or everyone.\n I can only take the challenge of trying to handle this weapon carefully.\n Have you ever been shot?\n Oh, countless times, definitely.\n And never landed in a cell? You never ended up in jail, right? In jail? I'm very lucky to live in this country, where you don't end up in jail.\n Others were more unlucky.\n Did you have a topic in the 90s where you said, oh shit, I've been cheated on?\n Or would you not do that anymore?\n Actually I don't have anything in mind where I would say, oh then i have to distance myself completely from it no idea maybe that's also\n in my memory i don't remember things that i told a year ago\n let alone things that i told 20 years ago sometimes i cram in old texts\n and am completely surprised by how much my humor has changed since then.\n So that's really the amazing thing.

Or is that cynical? I don't know myself better, but does it make those...\n Humor can be cynical sometimes.\n But cynicism is not constructive.\n No, not everything has to be constructive. It can also be funny. Just laughing about something because it's bad is also possible.

            "reference_answer": "\nCurrently, there is a plan in Germany to ban the use of new diesel vehicles from 2030, as mentioned by Great Britain. However, there is a problem with bridge technology as many diesel vehicles sold today can still be driven for 15 to 20 years. Dieter Nuhr, a comedian, has expressed his views on this issue, stating that the ban on diesel vehicles is a mistake and that diesel technology is not as dirty as petrol engines. He also mentioned that his next car will be an electric car, acknowledging the problems with individualized traffic and the need to find solutions in a non-authoritarian way. Nuhr also shared his observation of China's successful implementation of electric mopeds as a solution to air pollution in their cities. He believes that humor can be a way to address the challenges of implementing authoritarian solutions in an anti-authoritarian way. Nuhr has previously positioned himself as a diesel fan and appreciates the efficiency of diesel engines, but recognizes the advancements in battery technology and the need to transition to electric vehicles.",

You don't have to own your own.\n That's the problem I learned from our climate scientists in recent years.\n We have too many individual cars that drive 23 hours a day.\n The problem has been known for 40 years.

I don't have any fancy cars either. I'm not interested in driving a certain car. No, I don't think so.\n My grandpa, I come from the GDR, after the turn of the century, always had to drive a Mercedes every five years.

That was my opinion.\n You didn't know about Stasi?\n Of course we knew about Stasi. But as a leftist, you always play that down while you play the other one up.\n Then in 1989, on November 9th, I drove off to G\u00f6ttingen, towards Duderstadt, because the wall was open and I couldn't believe it. And I went through the city in Duderstadt, which was full of people at 4 p.m.\n at 4 p.m. and saw a key picture of my life.

And that was the moment\n when I thought, you better shut up now, you don't understand what these things mean.\n Because we were classic back then, all this material shit, it's all too much, it has to stop.\n And that was an essential point where I learned that these things, these goods that we have presented as a pure fetish character,\n that it simply has a deeper meaning, that you can afford them or not. And that it is a very arrogant attitude to say to someone who can afford the goods,\n that's not all that important.\n But what you criticized was the overconsumption, right?\n Yes.\n And the Aussies have no consumption at all.\n Where does the overconsumption begin? I don't know.\n If we consume so much that it harms our earth.\n Yes.\n When did you go to the earth? Were you ever in front of the earth in the GDR?\n Once in East Berlin in 1982.\n And?

                "That really proved itself. In that respect, my father was a great help to me.\n But you were probably too young for the 68ers and stuff. Did you notice it? Yes, I did.\n My first memories were of The Beatles, long hair.\n When my mother told me that they were boys, I said,\n that's completely incomprehensible.\n It can't be, because they have long hair.\n They can't be boys.\n Those are my first childhood memories.\n I've noticed it. And then then when we were puberty, that was the beginning of the 70s, everything was processed.\n But it was still the case that I couldn't go on vacation with my first girlfriend, because there were still the couple paragraphs. minors who may have had sex together could not rent a hotel room\n if they were not married. That means you always had to go on a lot of tent vacation.\n That's nice. Yes. And so we have steam wars and demos. Do you remember your first demo? Not the first one, but I remember some demos.\n For example?\n Everyone has the Bonner Friedens demo from 1983.\n I don't remember exactly. That was the youth period. I think everyone experienced it relatively similar.\n Relatively similar, in contrast to today, where everything is possible.\n Back then, I think, they split up in the 80s, that there was something like an alternative.\n And then on the other side, these poppers, these incredible people who thought you had to dress up.\n And then there were differences between youth cultures.\n But actually it was much more limited than it is today, I think.\n Did your attitude towards peace, when you were at the demos, still hold on?\n Are you still against the wars?\n Against war? Yes, I think it's nice when you don't have any.\n So what kind of question is that?\n I have no idea.\n What kind of question is that?\n Yes, of course.\n In the context of this show, it's always like that.\n That I somehow have CDU politicians or SPD politicians who say,\n yes, I was against the Vietnam War on the street\n and then they also decided on the Iraq War or the Afghanistan War.\n I think that there are a lot of questions that are very deficient. and then decided to join the Iraq war or the Afghanistan war.\n I think that many questions are very difficult, especially Afghanistan for example.\n It's not a question of whether you are for war or against war,\n but in Afghanistan there was a government that practically fought a continuous war against the population. Where children, girls don't go to school,\n girls are kept at home like a commodity.\n And it will probably be like that again when the troops withdraw.\n I think the question, if you ask the question,\n are you for or against war?\n I think that's just a bad abbreviation of the terrible facts, I think it's just bad.\n Because the question can't be, are you for or against war? The question is, is violence a solution?\n Because we are always told, violence is not a solution. In world history, violence has always been a major solution to problems.\n And that is a sad continuity of human existence.\n But the violence we have used has not contributed to the solution in the last 20 years.\n In the last 10,000 years since people have weapons, violence has never contributed to an\n end-to-end solution because there is no end-to-end solution in history. But of course\n violence has always contributed to regulating power relations.\n And we have to stand up to that.\n The Greens have to stand up to that.\n We have been socialized totally as pacifists.\n And I believe that you cannot organize the world pacifistically\n as long as not all of us are pacifists.\n In this respect I would say, one has to ask the question, how do I stand with Afghanistan or how do I stand with the Iraq war?\n No matter if you reject it or not, but you can't just reduce it to the question, are you for or against war? That's unspeakable.\n There are those who say, war is generally violence and generally shit.\n Of course you can say against it, then you get hit in the face and mouth.\n Good, that's how it is.\n And then you can say, okay, there are wars that are just, where violence makes sense.\n There is no just war.\n I would signify that to this day, of course, there is none."

This was due to the couple paragraphs that prohibited minors from renting rooms if they had engaged in sexual activity. Nuhr also mentioned his memories of demos and the Bonner Friedens demo from 1983.

Who is allowed to produce them? Who has the right?\n Who is allowed to do it?\n We have to use the drug dealer argument. If I don't give them drugs, they will get them from somewhere else.\n But we could still say, we don't participate in that.\n That's why there are still drugs.\n Right.

It's a moral dilemma.\n And that's why I'm so annoyed that so often a lot in the shitstorm is reduced to good or evil.\n Because it's not perceived that it's a dilemma of evaluation.\n Both are bad. Building weapons is bad.\n Not having weapons is also bad.\n How do you deal with it? Who is allowed to build weapons?\n Just with the nuclear power plants.\n I was always an enemy of nuclear power.\n Of course anti-RKW movements and so on.\n The end of the song is that the nuclear power plants were made by a lot of forces that could do worse than we could.\n And they are standing at our western border, where when the wind comes everything is blown over our country.\n The exit has not brought anything in principle so far.

But then it has brought something like this, so that we don't produce more atomic waste,\n where we don't know where to bake it.\n Now the French are producing it and we will import their electricity.\n We are constantly importing their electricity, because it stabilizes the power grid.\n Because we all know that we cannot live here alone with wind and sun.\n We know that.\n As of today, but in 10 or 20 years it is possible.\n The Federal Office of the Environment.\n You just said that it will be invented at some point, but we can't go beyond that now.\n Did I say that?\n Let's see.\n The diesel topic and the batteries.\n You said you had the fuels.\n Oh, whatever.\n You said that there is something funny about arms exports.

I think they already know that before they start building.\n So in this respect, the application is only made if it has an outlook on success.\n That would be the one question I would answer.\n And the other is, we are in fourth place, it also depends on the weapons species that are exported. I'm not a specialist there, I have to be honest.\n I read that again and again, also with this look and think, shit, I would very much like to have a weapon-free weapons, I think that's great. But unfortunately the world isn't like that and I see the dilemma that we need weapons to survive on this world.\n Because otherwise the one with the big coil comes and hits us on the skull and says, I'm going to decide here.\n And I think that's what, there aren't many continuities in human history, but this is part of it, that they are regulated by power questions and that violence is an essential factor.\n Sure. Or, what is also absurd, we are delivering dictatorships. The Saudis, the Egyptians, who can suppress their population.\n It also rarely happens to me because the situation is very difficult. I see a moral dilemma there too. Indeed, if we only surround ourselves with allies who fulfill our moral standards,\n then we are quickly alone in this world.\n This wish is simply not achievable in this world.\n Very sad.

We don't do anything with Africa.\n That doesn't mean we don't do anything, but we don't give them weapons.\n Where is the limit? Where are you out of the moral dilemma?\n The tools of violence would be a limit. That's...\n Then they buy them somewhere else. And we don't know what's in there anymore. We don't have the ability to build it.\n I don't want to defend it. Now you're putting me in a position where I'm defending the German armament industry.\n I just want to say that the problem is not that simple for me.\n And that I don't know exactly where the limit would be for me.\n With what I still consider acceptable and what I no longer consider acceptable.\n I don't know exactly where my limit is.

And it's not like nothing happened.\n The second thing is that it's not like the state of science\n would have always been like today.\n The doubts were bigger in the 80s, in the 90s.\n I remember that 12, 15 years ago the discussion\n came up that the earthworm stopped that there was this famous gap between I think 1995 and 2010\n where the earthworm did not go any further than in the models that was an essential point I think\n where many people have hooked and said that is that even true, what the climate scientists say?\n The scientific stand was not the way it is now in 2020, but it was a different one.\n And you had justified doubts to ask why, when all models predict that the world will get so much warmer,\n why is nothing happening in the last 15 years?\n And then they found out that this is due to the heat absorption capacity of the\n world's seas and that it was 2012 or what I don't know anymore if I didn't stop\n and that the heat dissipation then increased and so on but you can't do that\n as if you had all that you know today then 2008 knew or should have known it\n but it's about that greta says we should push panic because we just don't do enough.\n If you as a private person would spend as much money as you take in,\n then you would tell your manager, you tell me when I need shit.\n I don't need a manager.\n You know what I mean. It's not viable's no longer viable and we're consuming resources and energy.\n I got stuck with the term panic.\n I think the emotionalization of the topic is not good.\n I think we are only able to make such extensive changes with reason as those that are now necessary.\n So I think that only then will it be possible to do this with international cooperation.\n My only hope regarding this is that China will be able to drive the rest of the world into a climate-friendly future,\n when it's time. I have little hope that this will happen in the context of the current power situation\n in the world, that we can really achieve reasonable climate goals. It's crazy that we, or that you now have to wait for an authoritarian, dictatorial state,\n because our free democratic society cannot do that?\n It is indeed a big problem that authoritarian states are much more flexible in matters of control, that's for sure.\n But apart from that...\n They don't need a democratic base.\n It's not like nothing happened. A lot has happened in the last few years.\n We agree on that, but it's not enough.\n There is the Paris Climate Agreement. Whether that's enough or not will be shown. Just because there is an agreement doesn't mean that something is done against it. That is currently the criticism of all opposition parties except the AfD and all climate associations,\n that the federal government has signed this contract, but no measures."

I don't think panic will help us.\n Another example is with Corona. Two weeks ago Lothar Wieler, you probably know him from RKI,\n he also pushed panic in a press conference in Spain. He made this Dolomite comparison,\n where he said we're going to the Dolomites with 100 things and want to take a 30th turn with 100 things.

And of course you can want that.\n I don't think we can get to that point.\n I think we still have to count arguments in a democratic legal state.\n And I am very much attached to this form of civilisation.\n For me, panic is the opposite of civilisation.\n That means I have to talk to those who have a different opinion.\n But that still happens.\n It's just being driven by the immensity of the problem that many who have the knowledge still deny.\n If you notice that the EU has decided to become CO2 neutral by 2050, then that's a decision that would have been unthinkable ten years ago. Completely unthinkable.\n And that decision was made because reason has moved an incredible amount.\n Now let's go ten years further. Then other decisions will be made that will probably be far more sufficient. But it will not be the panic that brought us there,\n but the reason, the knowledge of arguments, the interaction of states. We are sitting here in an\n incredibly civilized process.

That's the difference.\n Are there countries you haven't traveled to yet?\n Oh, a lot.\n If you can travel again, where do you go first? There are some that I haven't traveled to. There are really blind spots. For example, America is a blind spot for me.\n All these Caribbean countries and so on. Because I'm not really interested in that either.\n And somehow, whenever it was time, should we go to Cuba or something, then I have ...\n I think Costa Rica is relevant for you because there is no military there. That would be something interesting.\n There is a lot of jungle for that. Costa Rica is a very beautiful country, but it didn't draw me there.\n Is there a place of wish you want to fly to first?\n I don't know. I think I'll repeat a trip where I don't know yet is uganda would\n I would like to look at uganda rwanda I haven't been all the way to india yet\n I would like to go back there because I always want to be in India again and in\n china to china I really want to go back there very quickly because I regret\n very much that I can't go there at the moment, because I'm also exhibiting a lot in China.\n My pictures are hanging on some biennial in Jinan and I can't go there. That's a shame.\n Do you actually compensate for your flights? So CO2 compensation?\n What I do myself, nobody cares about anything at all.\n You could have said that you do it in principle.\n Do you know your carbon footprint?\n No, I don't know it exactly. I don't think it's good either.\n Do you work on it yourself?\n As I said, if I do it myself, nobody cares because I keep it for my personal decisions.\n But you do that too.\n Yes.\n Your own life is also political.

I would be very much for forcing that, that we can fly cleanly.\n Because I think that the contact between the peoples and the earth parts must be particles in some form, it has to be possible. That is incredibly important, I think, because it contributes\n an incredible amount to understanding and I find that for us\n air traffic is one of the things where\n it also annoys me that the problem-solving strategies\n that would have been possible 20 years ago were not tackled.\n And that we will probably need 15 years now until we have hydrogen-powered aircraft,\n where you say, why didn't we start 10 years ago?\n Then we would be five years old, because air traffic was already known for a long time\n that it is very harmful to the atmosphere.\n I think it's bad that it is.\n But economic constraints have played a huge role there.\n That means, if 10 years ago the Lufthansa boss had decided to say, we will change our fleet to hydrogen powered aircraft in the next 15 years,\n then they would have just thrown them out and would have used a new one.\n So in that respect...\n They could have supported him with laws, so that he wouldn't have to vote.\n Yes, they could have done that, yes. Ten years ago, I think so too.\n You were a mass-dealer. I thought that was super interesting.\n I don't have anything to do with the church.\n Why did you become a mass-dealer? Your father wasn't a priest or a priest.\n No, a mass-dealer was quite normal in Germany. I'm from the Rhineland.\n And back then, in the 60s, it was completely normal that when you came from a Catholic family,\n where someone would go to church every now and then, that you would also go to the Mass-Divorce.\n Besides, the Mass-Divorce story was also very funny, because it was about a community home where you met.\n And that was a kind of what you would call a youth center today.\n And there you met and there was also, when we were eleven, twelve, we liked to play flaschen drehen with tongue.\n And we thought that was good.\n So was the church just a pretext for happiness?\n The church was a bit like...\n It was in the corner, there was a playground where you met, there was the community home,\n and then you went there on Sundays and chatted at the right place.\n But were you a religious person? Were you raised in a godly way?\n No, I don't think so. Not really.\n Do you believe in God? Are you an atheist?\n No, I'm not an atheist. I'm the classic agnostic. I don't know what's there.\n A lot of people always come up with the argument, there's more than we know.\n And I'd say, yes, definitely. But the problem with what we don't know is that we don't know it.\n And that's why we can't draw it in to decide something.\n I thought, if you're a mass worker, then you probably have to...\n The priest is looking for you because you're a good, faithful boy.\n I think I would have put it differently at 11.\n Yes, that's how it was at 11.\n I probably didn't ask that question.\n It was just a normal part of the culture in Catholic Rhineland,\n like carnival or shooting or something.\n Why did you want to be a teacher?"

Yes, of course.

I don't know.\n I'm very impatient.\n Actually.\n I don't know if that's necessarily part of being a good teacher.\n Um...\n I think every teacher has pros and cons.\n I don't know. I think I would have been a pain in the ass for many students.\n Because I would have been a pain in the ass for many students, because I would have been very determined.\n How many teachers are there in the character that you only portray on stage?\n Um, actually zero. Because as I said, I didn't work as a teacher, I really learned as a teacher. I learned from teachers, because teachers learn in the lecture hall or when you work at school.\n The study itself is the purely scientific part, which I found absurd in retrospect for the people sat there and read their lectures from the table.\n And you thought, what should that be like with them as teachers, if you put them in front of a class?\n That's going to be awful.\n And that's how it was, I think.\n Back to your character on stage, what role does the titan play on stage?\n My character on stage?\n My character on stage is actually very close to me since the time I'm speaking the individual speaking on stage. Of course I always say things that I wouldn't normally say.\n I play a confusion that I don't have or I play knowing exactly what I don't have.\n But these are individual parts. Actually the character is pretty close to me.\n Is she an educational character? Is she a fun-loving character? An entertainment character? A critic of the relationship, of the power?\n Yes, now you've put it all together nicely.\n All at once?\n Yes, of course. No, first of all she's a deconstructing character. She She questions.

These newspapers included Taz, Die Tageszeitung, and FAZ, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The photos were taken from a central perspective, giving the impression of a medieval apotheosis-like image. In contrast, the coverage of Armin Laschet, the CDU candidate, featured photos taken from the bottom left or top right, and his facial expressions were not as pleasant or friendly as Baerbock's. Laschet is generally perceived as a sympathetic person, but the photos did not convey that image. The difference in photo composition and facial expressions between the two candidates suggests a willingness by the press to put Baerbock in a favorable light and create a hype around her campaign.",

First of all, I can't suffer the word privilege because I don't have a privilege.\n I haven't been given anything, I've worked everything out myself and if I'm standing there now and have my own TV show, then it's not a privilege, but something that I have acquired in my life, piece by piece, through continuous work.\n And something acquired is not a privilege.\n Privilege means in German, privilege.

That means, what I do is not unsocial,\n but you can also imagine economic-friendly solutions in this case,\n which in the end lead to better solutions for everyone.\n And that means I don't have to follow the recipes that implicitly include this question.\n That means I can only say something landlord-friendly, I can only say something rent-friendly, but it is also possible that the landlord-friendly is socially thought. That's often thought to me too short.\n The humor has to go into a certain corner\n to practice a certain function.\n First of all, I don't think so.\n But even if I make myself funny\n about Friday for Future or about Mietendeckel,\n then that doesn't mean that I'm an unsocial person\n or that I don't care about the fate of the planet,\n but that means that I prefer other solutions."

It is the case that we are based on a state of eating, that we had a western world in my youth, in the times when I grew up, socialized and we had a third world, they had nothing, they were poor, they were hungry.\n So now the world has developed further since then and it has improved in many respects and in many respects, deteriorates.

Who are you?\n Hello, I'm Lena Rohrbach and I work for Amnesty International in Germany.\n I'm going to be 60 years old today and that's why I'm allowed to be here.\n Today?\n Yes, actually today.\n Congratulations.\n Thank you very much. We did well.\n Obviously. Did you celebrate today?\n Corona is making it a bit difficult. We have received a number of congratulations from our home offices, from the German Institute for Human Rights to many private people who wrote to us and congratulated us.\n But such a big celebration, maybe when the pandemic is over.\n Explain briefly, what is Amnesty International?\n Amnesty International is a very large, probably the largest human rights movement in the world.\n We have 10 million members and supporters worldwide.\n In Germany, it's about 150,000 people who are members or support us.\n And we are a club here in Germany, which means we have a very strong office of honor. It is organized in over 600 groups.\n So if you would join MNISTY, you could either network locally with the people from your region\n and write letters for political prisoners, for example. That's the classic.\n Or if you are particularly interested in a topic or a country, you could join a group\n that has a special expertise in this country or this region or this topic.\n But we also have a main office secretariat, because of course not everything can be registered as a volunteer and I work for that.\n Do you hire everyone?\n We basically hire everyone first, but we already have a statute that says that, for example, people position as people of interest are allowed to be excluded from the Ministry.\n Last time we had Kloster Hummel from the railway and transport association.\n They have a guideline that says that members of the AfD are not allowed to be members.\n Is that the case with you?\n Honestly, I don't know.

And that concerns a number of human rights.\n This, for example, concerns human rights on the private sphere, of course, quite indirectly.\n We all have a right to a certain sphere of our own,\n which the state actually has no access to. It also includes the protection of our communication.\n And in fact, privacy, I'll try to bend forward a bit,\n privacy is a so-called enabling right.\n That's what the special rapporteur for privacy once defined it like that.\n An enabling right is a right that puts you in a position to perceive other rights.\n Like the right to freedom of opinion, for example.\n That means that it is closely linked to other other rights. Like the right to freedom of opinion. That is closely linked to other human rights,\n like freedom of opinion and information.\n You can see that in the so-called Chilling Effects.\n There are a number of studies that prove that.\n So if you are afraid to be monitored,\n you say less freedom of opinion.\n Of course, in countries with a poor human rights situation,\n even less, but even in Germany it can be proven.\n We also did our own survey and about 20% said that after the Snowden revelations, they don't express themselves as freely online as they did before.\n Or maybe they don't search for the same information anymore, or if so, only with the Tor browser.\n Why is that?\n It's called the chilling effect.\n Why is that a chilling effect? If you feel that you are being watched, you just behave differently.\n We both behave very different than we would normally do.\n We try to have a certain way of talking.\n I try to be sympathetic and competent in a certain way, because I know I have a lot of eyes on me, probably, in view of the number of viewers.\n And I think everyone knows that, even if you know that an surveillance camera is aimed at you, then you behave differently.\n Has this been verifiable in the last seven years?\n It can be verified by interrogation, but you can also look at the behavior of people.\n For example, there were these videos that were also seen on social media of protesters in Hong Kong who tried to protect themselves from face recognition through masks.\n They also tried to dismantle masks where they suspected that face recognition technology could be on them.\n And in Germany, too? Is that also verifiable?\n It is verifiable because we did an investigation and asked people representatively. And 20% said to us, yes, they changed their behavior online.\n But they are only 20%.\n Yes, but that's always, I think that's not that little.\n Did you behave a little differently after the 9-day online?\n A little bit, yes.\n But it's actually like that, I just tried to explain that privacy is a special right,\n because it is also linked to a lot of other rights.\n But even if there were no chilling effects, it would still be an intervention into privacy, to be monitored in your communication.\n Now it is the case that you can intervene in most human rights.\n So the right to torture, for example, is something different. You are not allowed to torture anyone, no matter what. But in the right to privacy, you can intervene in a just way."

If you look at it, then there have been strong monopolies.\n And users are in the situation of compulsion that they,\n if they want to use Facebook, they also have to agree to the Facebook AGB.\n And our position is that it cannot be without free consent if you are simply excluded from the Soros platform.\n That is why it is very necessary that there is now a stronger regulation that, for example, obliges platforms that they are not allowed to make the use of their platform dependent on it.\n That users agree to such an invasive tracking and then advertise it,\n that all the data collected about you is processed to make it a very targeted advertising.\n But you know that they will earn their money with it.\n Yes, that's clear.\n So you want to destroy the business model?\n Well, I personally wouldn't be able to do that, but in fact we are of the opinion that the business model...\n So Facebook only earns a few and ninety percent of the revenue from advertising. And as long as the business model continues to run so unregulated, I think it's extremely unlikely that you can do anything about this massive data collection of companies.\n The cool thing is that when I use Facebook, Facebook evaluates how I behave, when I click on what, how long I need to type something, what I'm looking for, and create a profile from that how I could behave in the future.\n And this profile, this behavior, this behavior requirement is sold to the customers.\n Not the data itself, but sometimes a misunderstanding, so to speak, the access to your virtual identity, to your person, the access to you, that is sold.\n And with that they steal my own data, because the data is my behaviour.\n Exactly. They say a lot about you and that's why they are so valuable.\n There is currently an attempt to regulate this on a European level.\n There are especially the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act in discussion at the moment.\n And they are trying to accept this problem and we are very hopeful that this could lead to a European way that is a bit more exemplary and that companies take it more seriously.\n There are a few promising approaches, but they don't go far enough.\n Let's start with your approach. You already mentioned Jojana Suboff, she's against us splitting up Facebook, Amazon and Co.\n Because then you have even more players to fight with.\n We're not an anti-cartel organization per se, but a human rights organization. That means we are semi-neutral about whether there is a kind of need for split-up.\n What is needed is, keyword interoperability, that means, regardless of whether you split up something or not, that you ...\n We have a so-called network effect, that means you are in the network where your friends are, otherwise it doesn't make sense. If you are alone in a super privacy-friendly network with two other people, that's not attractive for you.\n But if it were possible to interact with Facebook from a network that protects your privacy much better, for example.\n Or to write a Twitter message or post something on Instagram.\n Then you would find it more attractive to choose this entry point.\n And the problem is that this interoperability,\n that you can still interact with the people in a different network from a competitor,\n is practically not possible, because of course the networks are blocking each other.\n And that's something you could legally prescribe.\n So in practice I can't send an email to Google with my Facebook Messenger?"

If you are alone in a super privacy-friendly network with two other people, that's not attractive for you.\n But if it were possible to interact with Facebook from a network that protects your privacy much better, for example.\n Or to write a Twitter message or post something on Instagram.\n Then you would find it more attractive to choose this entry point.\n And the problem is that this interoperability,\n that you can still interact with the people in a different network from a competitor,\n is practically not possible, because of course the networks are blocking each other.\n And that's something you could legally prescribe.\n So in practice I can't send an email to Google with my Facebook Messenger?\n No, exactly. You can't.\n Suboff says we have to introduce a basic right,\n or a better basic right,\n where reading and commercializing my behavior, my data, is only mine.\n No company can buy it from me or get it through a click.\n This would restrict this surveillance.\n Yes, we are there to keep something similar under control, for example that your data protection settings must be such that if you log in designs, but something like this is not currently an opt-out.\n That means, first of all, it is set up as it is best for the company.\n And then you have to click through somewhere and set it up personally friendly.\n We can already see from these cookie banners that we all get how likely it is that you first click through five minutes to become the most privacy-friendly option for 5 minutes. And the privacy-friendly option is always the big button,\n which you can see very well, everything agrees.\n Right. That's a really good tip.\n I personally find it too exhausting to go to the settings and look at everything in detail.\n But if the things are actually set up in accordance with the GDPR,\n the European Data Protection Convention,\n then you only have to go to the option to set up exactly instead of Accept All.\n Once scrolled down, you don't even have to look at what's there and then accept it by choice.\n Because what has to come after that is the more privacy-friendly option.\n Companies want you to accept everything,\n but the normal setting is to deactivate everything.\n Exactly. If you look at it, not everyone does that,\n but 9 out of 10 do.\n And in that way you don't need 5 minutes longer,\n but only 2 seconds longer.\n But that's another weakness of the legislation,\n that companies still...\n Opt-out is still a weakness.\n And that's why we're doing our lobby work for the Digital Services Act,\n that it's set up on the opt-in.

We could actually imagine a ban on targeted advertising\n because of invasive tracking.\n And the interoperability is\n two very big points.

Yes, yes.\n How do you fight it? Do you have an insight? You said you're also a lobbyist. Yes, of course. There is an incredibly strong lobbying work on the big platforms at the moment on the European Union level.\n Are they more successful than you?\n We'll see at the end of this whole thing.

Let's talk briefly about the patent release.\n It has always been a topic for us, a press conference and so on.\n Why does Germany block it?\n There is a vote on the WTO level, on the World Trade Organization.\n And a few months ago it was like this, the Americans and Europeans both said no.\n Yes.\n And now the Americans have said, we would say yes now.\n What I hear is that Germany is, or we are the ones who are pushing Europe to say no.\n Exactly.\n As long as that's the case.\n For example, Macron has, the French government is another government that you look at strongly in a European process of opinion-building.\n First of all, after the USA carefully spoke out for it, after Merkel very strongly held the Contra in her position, it has reverted.\n And now there is a discussion process within the European Union, but the federal government is actually very critical.\n Why? I can of course say why we are for it, why they are against it, you have to ask them.\n But there are a number of reasons that are being used for it.\n And one of them is that they believe that it would ultimately make no such big difference.\n That is also the argument of the lobby of the pharmaceutical companies at this point,\n because the production of mRNA vaccines is so complex that then the countries of the global south\n are not able to produce it at all within the remaining time. So you can\n also leave it. But that means, the topic is not patent issuance for mRNA vaccines, but all vaccines. And if then...\n It's even more than that.\n Oh yes?\n That is actually completely underrepresented in the debate that the proposal that South Africa\n and India made in October 2020 is not only focused on vaccines, but\n actually also on all medications and on diagnostics, for example, Corona tests\n are also necessary to get the pandemic under control, but also something like ventilators.\n So all the things you would need for medical or pharmaceutical goods, the patents should be released temporarily.\n And some of them are of course super easy to produce. So masks, for example, are not particularly complex in production.\n You and I could probably do that too, if we sat down for two days. It's a bit more complex than that.

And does the federal government defend the interests of the pharmaceutical companies as a last resort?\n Well, it is a bit of a cross-section.\n Also this argument that the production of vaccines, especially mRNA vaccines, is so insanely complex. First of all, one has to say that estimates suggest that the majority of the world's population\n will not have reached herd immunity by 2023.\n That means that even if it would take several months to build production capacities in countries\n in the global south, it would still be in time.\n So it won't last until 2023. The SOH CIDICI,\n that's the ex-director of chemistry, so a leading, a management staff of Moderna,\n he estimates that countries of the global south would need about three to four months to\n build up production capacities. There are also a number of companies that have said\n we would basically produce Biolase, for example, it is a Canadian company that said, we can assure you that 20 to 50 million once-vaccinated doses of the vaccine that you only have to vaccinate once, we can produce per year for the global south.\n But they don't get a license and that's why they sit on their production options and can't produce. And such companies could produce with a patent exemption. The Federal Government always says that the problem is not the patents, Lena, but the production capacities.\n I would say that's exactly the reason why the patents should be released,\n because there are free production capacities in the rest of the world.\n There are free production capacities in the rest of the world, they already exist.\n And then there is a series of production capacities that would be built up,\n even more, beyond what already exists.\n For example, the African Union has set up a regional plan for how it wants to build up production capacities in three states.\n These are Senegal, South Africa and Rwanda. But that would need investments, for example.\n And investors will only make these investments if they know that this will also be legally possible.\n That means that you can start with the construction of additional production capacities,\n over the empty spaces that already exist,\n only after a certain level of legal certainty has been established.\n I remember that Moderna, one of the MRNA manufacturers,\n already said last autumn that they have no problem with it if it is now released.\n We would not pursue it then.\n Yes, so Biontech, for example, sees it differently.\n Biontech and Pfizer, that's maybe another interesting story. Yes, so BioNTech for example looks different from Pfizer.\n That's maybe another interesting story.\n I also learned that in that context.\n And the patents are regulated by the TRIPS.\n That's the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.\n And that is also closely linked to the creation of the WTO.\n So that was already there quite early. And that means that states of this agreement are not allowed to fall under a certain minimum standard of patent protection.\n There are some exception rules, but it sets minimum standards for patent protection.\n And that also comes together with the fact that this agreement was very strongly lobbied by an initiative, the so-called Intellectual Property Rights Committee.\n These were 13 US-American corporations that, due to the founding of the WTO,\n sat down and said that something like Monsanto was involved, for example, but Pfizer was also already involved.\n So they wrote down these strips a lot.\n And now we have BioNTech and Pfizer, who in calling for it and saying that there should be no patent exemption.\n Although there is now a possibility of a waiver in the TRIPS agreement, i.e. a declaration of renunciation of patents."

Either the vaccine and patent issuance, you can also signal\n willingness to international cooperation.\n And that's the case, I think, that sometimes there is also the worry\n that China and Russia, with their vaccines,\n might rather run a policy that then\n partly to license, to give free or to them, and to build relationships with other countries\n if you don't want to go back.\n But that's just speculation.\n And ultimately it doesn't matter why they switched.\n It's good that they did it.\n But it still doesn't help if we Germans still block them\n and are the bad guys.\n It's just that the WTO decides in consensus.\n Crazy, right?\n And the European Union needs a kind of consensus,\n because Germany doesn't vote directly for the WTO,\n but the European Union votes,\n because they have a common trade policy,\n for the WTO with one vote.\n That means, first the European Union has to agree.\n And then...\n Does it also have to be a unanimous agreement?

And they are also, at first glance, transparent arguments.\n I believe that the more than 100 countries, mainly of the global south, who support the WTO proposal,\n that is the majority of the WTO members, so a minority that opposes it,\n that they already have an idea of what could be produced in their countries and what not.\n Then the Federal Assembly always comes with, Lena, we have COVAX, this awesome initiative. It's also a great initiative, I wouldn't\n do it badly. Is it awesome? COVAX is great, but COVAX has its limits. So COVAX is an initiative\n with which up to 20 percent of the participating countries of the global south, rather poor countries\n that otherwise could not afford to buy vaccines themselves, should be provided. 20 percent of the participating countries of the global south, rather poor countries that\n could otherwise not afford to buy vaccines themselves, should be supplied.\n But first of all, it only goes until the end of the year. It is completely unclear what will happen at the end of the year.\n And I just said that a large part of the world's population will not reach herd immunity until 2023.\n And then it is designed to vaccinate 20 to a maximum of 27 percent of the most severely affected people.\n That is not enough for herd immunity either.\n And at the end of the day, COVAX can only distribute what is produced as a distribution mechanism.\n And produced is just too little.\n These things are intertwined.\n License payments are important, but there will be more license payments with a patent release. COVAX is important, but COVAX will be able to distribute more if more is produced and for that we need a patent release.\n It's not that these other things are not important, I don't want to talk badly about them, but they are building blocks that come together.\n And one very important one is missing and it is relatively far down the wall.\n I heard about a feature from Deutschlandfunk, they also dealt with COVAX.\n In principle, it is an initiative of the Western governments and the pharmaceutical companies to protect their intellectual property from patent issuance.\n So it's a bit like, yes, we're doing something. This is our initiative.\n Yes, this is of course the negative reading style. The positive reading style would be that some states have stopped exports and the EU has already allowed exports.\n I don't want to talk badly about COVAX, it should be fully financed and continued, but it's not enough on its own.\n It's a drop in the hot water.\n Are you a fan of the Gates Foundation in the Prevention of Vaccines. I haven't really looked into the Gates Foundation.\n I know that they are in a very restrictive position in this fight for the possible release of vaccines.\n They are critical and against it.\n The position of the pharmaceutical companies?\n Yes.\n Interesting, isn't it?\n Very interesting.\n We can think about it.\n Maybe Bill Gates wants to come to the show a little more.\n Do you have any hope that I can do something about it? What would have to happen for the federal government to say okay?\n Public pressure is definitely very helpful.\n Maybe a election campaign now or something. Yes, of course, for the election campaign too, in any case. We will\n still have a, for God's sake, ultimately we have limited opportunities as a TV society.\n That's why I'm saying now we will have a social media campaign on the subject in two weeks.\n Please take part and tag Steffen Seibert, because Ms. Merkel herself is not on Twitter."

            "reference_answer": "\nLena Rohrbach of Amnesty International argues that intellectual property protection for COVID-19 vaccines is hindering equitable distribution, particularly in the global south. She believes that the profits of pharmaceutical companies should not come before people's lives, and that the more than 100 countries supporting the WTO proposal for a patent release have a better understanding of what can be produced in their countries. Rohrbach supports initiatives like COVAX, but acknowledges its limitations, as it only provides vaccines to up to 20% of the participating countries and only until the end of the year. She also mentions that COVAX can only distribute what is produced, and that more needs to be produced for COVAX to distribute effectively. Rohrbach advocates for the release of patents to increase production and distribution, and encourages public pressure and social media campaigns to push for this change. She also mentions that the Gates Foundation, which is critical of patent releases, has a restrictive position in this fight.",

Wait a minute. The trade with surveillance technology was totally unregulated for a long time.\n Because that's something where you looked less at than, for example, with classic arms exports.\n Surveillance technology is a so-called dual use good, which can be used both militarily and civilly.\n Give us a few examples, so that it's a bit more tangible.\n What are surveillance technologies?\n For example, the German State Trojan, which is a surveillance software,\n you can play it on your cell phone if you find a security gap in your cell phone\n or if you somehow become physically vulnerable to the cell phone.\n Are you sure there is a State Trojan? I was at the Telekom last time, the CEO said something like that, he doesn't know.\n Are you sure there is a state trojan?\n I am sure there is a state trojan. On the one hand, there are police laws and now in the BND law and in the future, which is being reformed now, the possibility to implement them in the constitutional protection law.\n There are also\n statistics that they are de facto used I asked him whether he is happy with it\n that the constitutional protection, for example, or the bnd of the telekom can say help us with lena\n that is basically not particularly happy or so eco the association of internet management\n where claus landefeld also regularly sits in the office of a senior consultant, has spoken out against it. Even Facebook has spoken out against it.\n No, H\u00f6ttges didn't know about it at first, when he knew what it was about. And then he said, he would even play it himself. We have for example in Munich the company Finn Fischer, which produces a wide-spread Trojan with Finn Spy.\n And it is probably used by German federal authorities, the police, but also exported.\n For example, it was found in Turkey on a website that was tarnished as a site of the Turkish opposition movement,\n where you should please download the following information about the upcoming demonstrations of the opposition movement.\n And here would be such a nice app, you could then be very well informed.\n And when you downloaded it, you had de facto downloaded the German Trojan from Finn Fischer.\n In Myanmar they were found, in Egypt our researchers have one. We have a security lab, a team of hackers who research for such things\n and help human rights defenders protect their devices better.\n They also found it in Egypt, it is exported to the whole world.\n Although this is presumably illegal, because the federal government has not issued any export permits for this type of surveillance technology since 2015, has not issued export permits for this type of surveillance technology.\n But for others, for example systems for stock data storage and communication surveillance to Egypt,\n they were recently approved.\n Back to H\u00f6ttges, should I give you the contact number so that you can explain to him that there is such a thing?\n I mean, if the Telekom boss doesn't know what it is, they could be against it.\n I can imagine that he has also met other branch representatives and that now.\n Why do we even make something like that?\n I mean, we European companies.\n I mean, where should that be implemented? These are mostly human rights-threatening technologies.\n So first of all, why do you think that should be used in Germany, in Europe\n and then also be sold to all dictatorships worldwide?\n There is a European market and there is an outside European market, which, very problematic, as I said, German surveillance technology in Turkey, Myanmar, Egypt.\n Why is it being manufactured?"

Because the people who manufacture it earn money with it.\n And why is it being exported?\n As I said, from Germany it is presumably illegal, there is also a criminal complaint against Finn Fischer.\n From other European countries it is quite legal,\n from other European countries is quite legal. Because there are still sluices in the European Dual Use Regulation\n that regulates the export of such goods.\n And until recently they were even worse and even bigger.\n But a Trojan is considered dual use.\n So you can either use it in a good way or in a bad way.\n Yes, military and civilian. What is a good use or in bad use? Yes, military and civilian.\n What is the good use of a Trojan?\n We already said that privacy is a right and that you are allowed to intervene in principle.\n And that you are never persecuted in your right.\n And there are cases where you say, we really have a concrete suspicion that this person wants to blow up the station building.\n We get a legal permission, that would be the ideal case,\n and the judge looks at it carefully and has the time to look at it thoroughly, that would be the ideal case,\n and also knows the technique, that would be the ideal case, we don't have that. And says,\n yes, in this case I would actually say it is okay to monitor the communication of this person\n and to prevent severe criminal offense. And with a projaner something like that can happen specifically. But what we see now is a blatant expansion of the\n efforts to the news services. You're also in the news services?\n You also say news services? That's the government's\n word of admonishment. I've said secret services before.\n Yes, I'm one of those. There is also an attempt at a scientific distinction between\n news services and secret services, but in the language of communication I switch back and forth.\n Are there German companies? Let's start with German companies, which are kind of such a shit ...\n Fynn Fischer.\n Fynn Fischer. Is there another one?\n Those are the ones I know. There are also state Trojans from the private sector. I don't know who the people are who programmed this, but Fynn Fischer is the German company that makes this.\n The world's most potentially relevant manufacturer is in Israel, that's the NSO Group.\n How much do they earn? What do you have to imagine? That's very different and of course there are no open contracts that we can look into.

                "There is nothing else, except putting on make-up and trying to confuse the camera?\n For facial recognition technology?\n Did you have an idea?\n No, so in the end it's about trying to create resilient democracies with strong human rights standards and to create preventive prohibitions for technologies that are not related to the private sphere, like face recognition technology.\n We often try to do this with preventive prohibitions, even semi-preventive for autonomous weapon systems, for example, which is also a topic where we try to make a strong\n ban agreement and say Germany should move forward with preventive bans nationally with a good example.\n Yes, but then we earn, that's the Altmaier argument, the sale goes on anyway,\n the others earn, we can't do that either.\n Yes, what this argument that sometimes it's not true, because there's no other alternative is sometimes true.\n And then you can only make the moral human rights argument and say you're not doing something wrong because the others are doing it.\n We've already discussed that in a session. Sure, human rights and democracy say that it's important, but in the end profits and money make it more important.\n We have been doing this for 60 years and we have some successes to mark.\n When Amnesty started to impose itself against the death penalty, only 20 states did not file a death penalty, now there are over 100.\n When Amnesty started to impose itself for an international trade agreement, it was far long way off. And now we have one.\n One third of our so-called urgent actions,\n these are these letter-of-a-lifetime appeals for people who are arrested.\n For example, within 24 hours we have set up for the blogger\n who was arrested in Belarus and his girlfriend an urgent action.\n And then over 150,000 people in the network are active and write letters and 35% of them are successful.\n That's not nothing.\n What do you mean by that? We've been standing here for 60 years...\n I'm happy that I've given you some basic information about what Amnesty does and our successes before Hans comes.\n You can try it again, if it lets you. But where do we stand in 60 years?\n I think your wish in 60 years in terms of surveillance technology, what will Amnesty have achieved?\n We are on a path of divorce, definitely. But after technological development and the use of surveillance technology has also overtaken the legislation,\n I already see approaches to get things done,\n like with the Digital Services and the Digital Markets Act.\n And so, optimally, we have a situation in 60 years\n where technology serves people and promotes human rights,\n which it can do in the medical field,\n when it comes to education for rural regions,\n when it comes to access to knowledge and information,\n and not contributing to human rights violations.\n But the medical product is also always produced by some surveillance technology manufacturers,\n who say, we sell it in China because it's about early cancer detection and so on, not about surveillance.\n I don't see early cancer detection with facial recognition technology right now. But it is of course true that artificial intelligence, for example, has made massive successes in early cancer detection.\n But artificial intelligence is very specific to solving certain problems.\n We are not in a state as a human being that we have such a general artificial intelligence that can solve various problems at the same time.\n In this respect, when it comes to detecting cancer tissue cancer approaches, that's a great development.\n Lena, thank you very much for your time.\n Thank you.\n Follow Lena on Twitter. You have a weird Twitter name, Artepoora?\n Artepoora, that's a very nice one. Artepoora is an art direction that tries to make art out of such poor elements as dirt, wool sacks and steel to make art.\n Good.\n From Lena and now Hans with your questions.\n Yo!\n Yes, Arte Pura, do you know yourself?\n Interesting, it came from Italy in the mid-60s.\n Exactly, right.\n The microphone asks you to speak as close and confident as possible.

Not cramped or anything.\n So, here is a question, for example, about surveillance options.\n How easy could Tilo actually be hacked?\n What should journalists pay attention to today when they work with sensitive information?\n I said we have the Security Lab. These are security experts and hackers who\n counsel journalists, human rights defenders worldwide with concrete tips and also\n search through their cell phones if they have a legitimate suspicion that they might already have something.\n They could certainly do it better than I do.\n Very, very important, although insanely banal, are regular updates.\n What are you doing? You are aware of the risks, Big Brother, also in the modern form, is watching you.\n What do you do personally to avoid too many open doors?\n I made a few fundamental decisions that have to do with data collection, but also with the question of how I support companies with data or money or not. For example, I'm not on Facebook or WhatsApp.\n But that means that my partner has to be on WhatsApp\n so that he can notice me at the kindergarten group\n when they're at another playground and not at home.\n And I'm standing at a closed door with the child\n because I'm not in the WhatsApp group.\n That was the network effect we were talking about earlier.\n You already have disadvantages\n when you decide against a certain technology.\n And that's why it shouldn't be in the responsibility disadvantages if you decide against certain technology and therefore it should\n not be in the responsibility of individual people, but governments\n are responsible for regulating companies in such a way that human rights are protected.\n There was a question, also in the complex, are there any larger social media\n sites halfway safe for you, or alternatives, for example, to Facebook,\n to name the biggest ones. There are certainly attempts to found alternatives to Facebook and\n Twitter, such as Mastodon, but they then have the problem that only a certain,\n very interested clientele is on it. That's why I fundamentally fundamentally of the opinion that it's a question of how to regulate these giants so that you can be good at it.\n Would you consider that possible?\n I think that would be absolutely feasible and possible. At the end of the problem, the argumenters,\n so people are now getting angry about facial recognition and so on. I don't think\n they mean it seriously, they will ultimately love it just as much as they love Alexa.\n Yes, of course, there is always a balance with one's own convenience.\n And that is what the platform has been meant to do, that the most convenient option is the one that promotes your data-driven business model.\n And what consequences do we have to draw from that?\n It depends on how people love Alexa. In the the eu states that is between 70 and 80 percent\n but that can also be shown in other states we have made a survey the absolute\n broad majority of the german population is for a stronger regulation of big internet\n giants and at the same time we deliver all our data permanently on cell phones and so on\n we are just people We are just people.\n We are just complex and comfortable beings.\n But I'm really not\n there to\n shun individual users.\n Because life is exhausting enough\n without being\n tormented by your privacy\n on Facebook for hours.\n It's really the responsibility of the government\n to intervene in a regulated manner.\n Then there was the question of how much do you estimate the risk that authoritarian surveillance states,\n such as China, which then have the appropriate technology,\n can also use these for surveillance and control purposes in other regions in Europe,\n also in Germany, without us being able to defend ourselves against it.\n That definitely happens, that surveillance, data flows are global."

Relative, but not concerning surveillance technology.

So they don't have the money to buy a new computer every day, so they continue to use it.\n There is an extensive surveillance of the entire communication beyond that. And they told us they meet outside when they have something important to discuss.\n In addition, there was a lot of talk about the elections in Belarus and since then about internet shutdowns.\n And this Austrian communication company A1 was involved in this.\n And that's also something we've been talking about about, companies, if they are active in Belarus,\n they have to carry out human rights obligations.\n Beyond the national law in Belarus, they have an independent human rights obligation.\n They also have them according to the UN guidelines for economy and human rights.\n And they are not allowed to participate in that. should assume that in the case of the suppression, manipulation, human rights violations,\n for example in Belarus, technology that has been developed in the free western countries is used.\n That's just the way it is.\n Yes, of course. Belarus does not have its complete communication infrastructure based on Belarusian technology.\n What are you doing for Julian Assange at the moment?\n We have been running a global petition for Julian Assange for a while now,\n an urgent action, and we are setting ourselves up for his release,\n for the US to drop the charge,\n for the UK not to be allowed to deliver him to the US to drop the charges, for the UK not to let him go to the US, because he is threatened with torture and inhumane treatment.\n We have unfortunately already seen what can threaten Bruce Blower with the example of Chelsea Manning.\n We are of the opinion that what he did for freedom of the press is covered and that's why the charge must be dropped.\n He must be released from prison., we demand this urgent action.

Do you address the government, for example?\n We had this topic several times in the press conference.\n And when asked, the representatives of the government sometimes say,\n yes, we trust that there is a legal system in Great Britain,\n that the rule of law works there.\n Do you still address the federal government?\n Is there any response?\n Or is it that you are being\n dispatched with similar explanations?\n I am not responsible for the case of Julian Assange,\n so I don't know which specific lobby work\n happens to him."

I've been in the home office for a year.\n This is an edition from 2014, 2015,\n that I found with us from our annual report.\n So once a year we publish a report\n about the human rights situation in all countries in the world.\n I write a chapter on this for the Deutschland Kapitel.\n It is well researched\n and of course there is also a long chapter on Egypt.\n And if you don't want to have it as a book, you can read these annual reports on amnesty.de\n and see how the situation was in Egypt for the last year.\n And basically similar to that,\n is there an index of human rights violations\n in or through certain states?\n For example, there is the Press of press freedom by Reporter ohne Grenzen.\n Do you have something like that about human rights violations in terms of political prisoners, political prisoners in prison?\n We have included this annual against a list of the worst A3 rankings.\n Every human rights violation is bad for itself.\n In this respect, we have nothing that is similar to the index of the colleagues of Reporter ohne Grenzen.\n But we have the annual report where you can really make a decision for every country. The last question.\n In what extent does, this is a bit speculative, but why not,\n do you think the corona crisis leads to more strict surveillance institutions, facilities, applications?\n Yes.\n Yes?\n Yes, that's not speculative yet, you can show that.\n So, for example, well, there is always a particularly clear example in China,\n where a series of apps were developed that were then needed to climb trains or enter certain public spaces.\n There was one that then had an algorithmically calculated code of your risk of infection,\n but also shared the data with the police.\n Then further expansion of video surveillance,\n which was combined with thermal scanning, i.e. to measure your temperature.\n Monitoring technology that was used to see if people were in quarantine.\n And then there are also a number of countries that have developed a corona app like Germany,\n but which in Germany they have then relied on a decentralized model and have put a lot of effort into it.\n We looked at a number of Corona apps at the time, for example the one from Qatar, which was extremely problematic and was basically a mass surveillance instrument for the population."

And of course we have observed this very closely, as well as other NGOs,\n such as the Society for Freedom of Law.\n And there were moments when the proportionality was questionable,\n for example with a partial ban on meetings, any kind of meeting,\n regardless of whether the person with a good hygiene concept with distances,\n there is a person holding a sign, five meters away is the next person holding a sign, all open air. To forbid something like the association has come up with\n with regard to the protection of the infected is incomparable.

Austria is a relatively well-functioning social state compared to Germany.\n Maybe you can compare it more with Scandinavia than with Germany.\n That means if you go through Vienna and there in the U-Bahn, in front of the house,\n the U-Bahn, the U4 and the Ferdinand, in Karl Marxhof, then you will see a social building there,\n where the grass is mowed, the walls are freshly painted.\n It's all in relatively good, external order.\n The social network is relatively strong.\n The schools are, with some exceptions in Vienna, still relatively well equipped.\n I say well equipped, not necessarily good, but a lot of cash flow. We have a relatively well-equipped social network.\n The living costs of a Viennese are significantly lower than those of people who live in Hamburg.\n If you compare Vienna to Hamburg or Munich, you can always rent housing for a price that is unimaginable for a Munich citizen. So a 100 square meter apartment is found in this city for 900 or 1,000 euros.\n There is a massive social construction. 200,000 apartments in this city belong to the city of Vienna.\n 200,000 apartments, so almost half or a third of the population lives in a public communal housing development at very moderate prices.\n The city can control this housing policy extremely socially.\n We have the workers' chamber.\n This is a chamber that represents all employees as a think tank, but also in legal protection and approves the law.\n And we have managed the economic crisis and the refugee supply crisis relatively well, in contrast to Berlin.\n If you go through the city here, you will see relatively few homeless people on the streets, in front of the police stations.\n Unlike when you go over the shoulder plate in Hamburg.\n There were no refugee homes on fire. Not like in Germany, every week one.\n There are no beggars on the street. No one who is hanging herself is screaming.\n But the whole thing has become quite self-evident in the public eye.\n And people have the feeling that something has to change.\n We like to call it the fear of loss.\n The fear of loss before the staged decline.\n And that's a paradoxical state.\n That it's actually good for people.\n We're experiencing an extreme economic upheaval here.\n The unemployment rates are falling back, the tax revenues are spiking go up, but when people leave they will say they are completely\n fed up with the last years of the government. And that is a paradox.\n And the government benefits from that.\n But why do people say that? Don't you also explain to your readers?\n Well, that's the question. We do explain to them, but the question is whether\n clarification works. And now we have to get into the world of the media, because we want to talk about journalism.\n Both Strache and Kurz are mostly on Facebook.\n If you want to understand the two, you have to read their Facebook channels.\n Strache has about 700,000 fans, Kurz also about that many, I think a little less.\n And just as smart right-wing movements do it, social media lives off of emotionalization, we know.\n The more emotion, the more sharing, the more likes, the more embarrassment, the more clicks, the more capitalization, the more earned Mark Zuckerberg, the more people read the stuff.\n That means that what these two politicians master so perfectly is that they post things that again by the Austrian boulevard media.\n And what are these things?\n Foreign crime, refugee crime, headscarf, all these topics.\n And the boulevard media reinforce this by taking over these stories and again\n ping back on the Facebook pages.\n That means a ping-pong game is taking place."

            "reference_answer": "\nThe Austrian social housing policy is significant because it plays a crucial role in shaping the public's perception towards the government. The policy, which involves the city owning and managing a massive number of apartments (around 200,000) and providing them to the population at relatively moderate prices, has contributed to the relatively well-functioning social state in Austria compared to other European countries like Germany. This has led to a strong social network and relatively low living costs, making Vienna an attractive place to live.\nHowever, despite these benefits, there is a growing sense of dissatisfaction among the population towards the government. This is due to a fear of loss, as people feel that the last years of the government have not been good enough, and they want change. This paradoxical state, where the government benefits from the public's dissatisfaction, is a result of the extreme economic upheaval in the country, with falling unemployment rates, rising tax revenues, and a growing refugee population.\nThe role of social media, particularly Facebook, in shaping public opinion in Austria cannot be ignored. Both major political figures in Austria, Heinz-Christian Strache and Sebastian Kurz, have large Facebook followings",

Almost all so-called Bubals of J\u00f6rg Haider, that's what they were called,\n the Bubal party, is in prison or has been convicted or is now in court. So there is\n now the first tranche of FP\u00d6 politicians who are now committing a criminal case or a court case.\n Now we talked briefly about Sebastian Kurz. What is there to say about HC Strache?\n In his youth, Strache was a neo-Nazi.\n He was a admirer of Norbert Burger.\n He was a very well-known leader of the neo-Nazis.\n I think he was even an ally with his daughter.\n He did military exercises with the leading neo-Nazi Gottfried K\u00fcssl.\n But he always emphasized that this was a short phase and that he was not really a neo-Nazi,\n but that he had mistaken himself for a youth cultured.\n He was an extreme right-wing man, but he kept assuring himself in interviews that he had absented from this youth period.\n He was young and naive.\n There is this legendary photo that shows him doing it like this.\n This is the K\u00fchnengru\u00df for those who know the right scene.\n It's a kind of Hitler greeting.\n And then he asked me why this sign, and I said, I only ordered three beers.\n Now I would say, you can forgive a politician for his youth.\n Or you can discuss his youth.\n We remember Joschka Fischer, who was throwing stones or was violent.\n But then when this politician in his adult age seriously reflects on this time and thinks about it,\n that doesn't hurt Strache, but rather he blurs this time.\n He says the martial arts exercises he did, there are photos of this man who looks like a jihadist. That's Drache. He was called the interior minister, with a covered mouth, Kalashnikov and camouflage clothes.\n They did some martial arts exercises.\n But he says they were just paintball games.\n He is harming this time and that's what bothers me about him.\n And he keeps on talking about right-wing extremists who invite Holocaust advocates.\n For example, the Olympia. Stache held a speech there on the 150th anniversary.\n And some Olympians are sitting in the FP\u00d6 as members of the National Council.\n I mean, words from FP\u00d6-ers, from Nazis are one thing, actions are another.\n Do they act dangerous?\n You could say, let them make their stupid Nazi slogans. Dangerous.\n Could you say, let them make their stupid Nazi slogans? We don't have the redevelopment of National Socialism here.\n And that's what is always being said in the critique from the right and the left,\n that they say, you're doing a hysterical theater here and you're acting as if you were re-establishing the Third Reich.\n That's nonsense. Basically, they are doing a very boring policy.\n And if we look at the first episode of the blue-and-black government in 2000 to 2006,\n then the problem was not right-wing extremism, but corruption.\n They have enriched themselves, they were greedy.\n Also a sign of the right\n of the movements, that they are corrupt. In K\u00e4rnten, where the libertarians have ruled for a long time,\n they have more or less led the country into abyss by a major banking scandal.\n Many have been convicted of bribery. That means they don't live this image of cleanliness\n at all. This is certainly comparable to many right-wing movements,\n also in Germany, that they ultimately, that when they are on the move, they behave worse than the parties they criticize.\n It will be exciting to see whether this movement does the same or whether it is ideological.\n But unlike in Hungary, we have no open hatred of foreigners.\n This does not take place here in this way, at least not in the big media or not in the big\n assemblies. But of course we are still talking about symbolic politics, where it is about explaining\n Islam as the main topic of the country. Does the Austrian foreign policy change\n in this new government? Sebastian Kurz would say no."

Strache has emphasized that this was a short phase in his life and that he was not really a neo-Nazi but had been mistaken for a youth cultured. He has been criticized for downplaying and blurring this time in his life, particularly due to his continued use of Nazi-like gestures and associations with known Nazis. The interviewer expresses skepticism about Strache's explanation and notes that many other FP\u00d6 politicians from this period are now in prison or have been convicted of criminal charges. The interview also mentions that Strache has been criticized for his association with right-wing extremists and for holding a speech at the Olympia, a known neo-Nazi gathering, on the 150th anniversary. The interviewer questions whether Strache's actions are dangerous and whether the FP\u00d6's policy is ideological or simply corrupt.",

Let's have the last 100 days of the review.\n The FPO vice-chancellor, at least the deputy head of government,\n tells the Serbian separatists that Kosovo is part of Serbia.\n The FPO has a friendship agreement with Putin's Russia.\n And says, we work together.\n With his party or with the Russian party? With the party. Putin's Russia and says we work together.

So, it will be interesting to see if this country will orient itself towards Merkel and Macron\n and a new, strong, united Europe.\n That's what Merkel wants.\n Yes, more or less. With Macron together, there's already more than Orban.\n Or if we orient ourselves of Visegrad states.\n And say that Europe is a monologue that we don't want at all and we want to do as much alone as possible.\n Those would be the two extreme positions.\n The Austrian government will get into trouble a bit, because on the one hand they want to take back a lot of Europe,\n but at the same time they want to have strong foreign border protection.\n That costs a lot of money, of course. Where do we get that from?\n They want to drive Europe back.\n They don't want to pay more after Brexit,\n but at the same time they don't want to drive back the subsidies for the farmers\n and for the conservative regions with poor structure.\n So these are details that are exciting to observe.\n But I see that Kurz is becoming a light of light,\n also from right-wing movements throughout Europe.\n Because he embodies a right-wing populism with a youthful face.\n He's 31. So if he serves three legislatures, he's 45.\n As old as me.\n He's a three-time chancellor.\n Is that realistic?\n I don't know what's going on. I think the popularity is increasing massively.\n Austria's most popular politician is the distance.\n The question is whether the FP\u00d6 is losing so much that they will leave the coalition.\n And the question is also whether the FB\u00d6 will lose so much\n and the votes will go to the SP\u00d6 and the SP\u00d6 will become the strongest party at some point.\n But it doesn't look like that at the moment.\n I spoke to others who said that Kurz has the talent to always address the problems\n but never present solutions.\n He can always say things where everyone says, yes, exactly, that's a problem.\n But he doesn't present a solution.

The first strategy, let's assume we have a two-minute interview.\n He would start with saying, Mr. Jung, I thank you very much for inviting me.\n I am really grateful that I can now represent the positions of the listeners from my point of view.\n So he talks for a minute, thanks for being invited.\n Spends a lot of time and seems to be sympathetic.\n He also always opens his hands.\n He learned that somewhere and thanks very much."

I was one of the first, one of the first politicians in this country who put the weather on the political agenda at all.\n Because in all of Europe, people never really talk about the weather and also the weather.\n Only through my reforms did we realize that we have a problem with the weather.\n And if we don't address the problem with the weather now,\n if we don't realize that the weather that comes from abroad will change our country\n and that rain will come and thunders, if we don't protect ourselves there\n and really make sure that the weather gets better, then we will be here.\n And I already know that your friends here are of a completely different opinion.\n That's also a trick. He doesn't say you, he says your friends think it's quite different.\n He has a lot of retort, he's not very good at it, but he can do it very well.\n And interestingly enough, it impresses a lot of people, because he has such a very brave attitude. In the content there is a lot of Sarrazin.\n So if you read Sarrazin, you'll find that there is a lot of Sarrazin in there.\n And visually it's just a young, unimpeded,\n tough young man.\n You mean there are two strategies?\n Or did you just say two strategies? The first strategy is to never give an answer to the blah blah interview and never to give a clear answer to what you actually want.\n And the second strategy is to always position yourself as the first one who has addressed a real problem. Now we all know that every sensible head of state in Europe knows that there is a refugee supply crisis\n and that there is a problem of immigration and that people want to come from Africa and we have to handle it somehow\n and that a country needs borders and that one has to protect borders.\n But he acts as if he were the only one to recognize it.\n But at some point, I think, the Viennese mayor said,\n then he should finally close this damn border.\n Then he should finally close the Mediterranean route.\n So it's a lot of hot air.\n Is there also an interview strategy by Strache?\n Or a media strategy?\n Or does he talk like the...\n He also has his phrases.\n In reality, the interviews with the two are quite boring because they have a lot of phrases.\n You never get into a conversation.\n It differs from Christian Kern, with whom you can have a conversation.\n He also has phrases and he also has his stand-ins.\n And when you often listen to him, he says the same thing.\n But he goes into the conversation internally.\n And that massively distinguishes him from people at the neo or from people at the green with whom you can still have a political conversation.\n At least in a different way.

What could fall on his feet?\n What could he support?\n Well, ultimately that the economic reforms he is proposing meet his election.\n That they come to the conclusion that the social structure that exists in the country,\n and that, if you look closely, is extremely valuable,\n that when it breaks away, that people, some politicians once said, feel in their pockets.\n That people actually come up with it and say, wait a minute, this policy brings me as an employee, as a worker, as a middleman, little.\n And at the very beginning of the government there was one such moment.\n Kurz wanted to change emergency assistance, which is a form of unemployment insurance, into a kind of Hartz IV system.\n What does that mean? Someone who is unemployed for a long time no longer receives insurance,\n but first has to build up his entire fortune and only then gets some kind of state subsidy.\n We haven't had that yet.\n We haven't had that yet. That makes a big difference to Germany, because it leads to people not having to give their assets,\n i.e. they don't have to sell their apartment, their houses, and they are also pension insured in the time when they are unemployed.\n That means they also acquire insurance years.\n That means the poverty of age here, however high it is, is still much lower than elsewhere.\n And we don't have this absolutely precarious social class.\n And that's what he wants to change.\n And people notice that, of course, because they say,\n hey, I might be afraid of getting unemployed,\n and then I have to give my car, my house, my fortune,\n in order to get any kind of income.\n Then they quickly rolled back like a crepe\n and realized that it goes into the hearts of people.\n Let's see."

And we must not explain the rise of the right-wing movements by saying that there are a lot of dissatisfied, declassified people here,\n but that there are many people from the middle who are relatively good at it, who are afraid of losing something.\n To lose fear is to choose a much stronger driving force to the right- movements, than to stand at the bottom and come up.\n Because there is a relatively small sub-section that is really completely unrighteous.\n And it's also different. In Berlin or Hamburg there are no city-states where someone,\n well, not in Hamburg, but there are no no-go areas or no really deglacated ones,\n where any gangs are present.\n It's a relatively socially intact city.\n The unemployment rate in Vienna is relatively normal.\n There was a study, I've seen it a little longer ago,\n that shows that Vienna is one of the safest cities in the world.\n We are in rankings an extremely livable city.\n We can go anywhere, almost everywhere, almost every time.\n And people are afraid to lose that.\n And that also explains that the FP\u00d6 is strong in areas where there are no foreigners at all.\n And it is very weak where there are many foreigners, even if they are not elected."

One explanation, or I think there are two truths, and they can't coexist.\n On the one hand, people don't experience the people's relationship with others.\n That means they never see the Turks. And that will be harmless at some point.\n If I see, okay, the Turk is actually like me and he sells vegetables and you can greet him and he's a nice guy.\n First explanation, they never see that, they are afraid,\n because they look at their backs and are afraid that the Turks will come.\n And the second is that people are afraid that they will lose something,\n because they live in a homogeneous society and they want to defend it.\n The principle of change.\n Why does the left in Austria, SP\u00d6 has not found an answer to this?\n What could be the answer?\n There is fear of losses in Germany, fear of losing something.\n First of all, the SP\u00d6 is still not a party of emotionalization. The whole SP\u00d6 of Vienna has not played the racist card.\n It could have been done easily, just like other SP\u00d6 politicians would like to do it, but it never worked.\n Can you only express emotions in Austria with racism?\n That's the easiest form.\n And it has no answer to the identity crisis.\n It has no answer to the refugee question. And if it has an answer, it is too weak to communicate.\n You could stand here and say, wait a minute, in this city they have such a high quality of life for this and that and that and that reason. I would, if I were a civil servant here, I would poster at every corner and explain to people what they are\n offered here in terms of quality of life that is no longer available in other cities in the world.\n People should go to Rome or to the city of Hamburg. Let's see,\n how does it look elsewhere? But that is not communicated because it is somehow\n self-evident. The second is is that the SP\u00d6 failed to convey this Europeanization and internationalization of Austria to people as something positive.\n 23 years ago, Austria joined the EU.\n And Austria was, if we take the case of the Iron Front, away from it, let's say in the years 1989, so 30 years ago, Austria was cut off from the case of the Iron Front in the past, let's say in the years 1989,\n so 30 years ago, Austria was cut off from the East and the West.\n It was a provincial country, a country of ruins with a lot of people with stele hats and\n loom coats and grand vines.\n And this country has changed in a way that is breathtaking in the last 30 years.\n It has not only become more international, it has also become more open. There is a strong civil society.\n There is a strong cultural scene here. Vienna is the most growing city or one of the most growing cities in Germany.\n It is the second largest German-speaking city. It is a bustling town. But that\n the ruling SP\u00d6 in this city did't tell people that this was a chance.\n And the right-wingers always say, oh, everything will be taken away, everything will fall.\n Although that's not the case objectively.\n Why is there no party on the left of the SP\u00d6?\n Because the Greens, unlike the social democratic movements, didn't want to improve the situation of the people, but rather the people.\n And that had something to do with God and it gets on people's nerves."

Austria has undergone significant changes in the last 30 years, becoming more international and open, with a strong civil society and cultural scene. However, the ruling SP\u00d6 did not convey this as a positive opportunity to the people, allowing the right-wingers to exploit their fears of losing their homogeneous society.\nThe second reason is that the SP\u00d6 has not been able to effectively address the fear of losses and the identity crisis through emotionalization and communication, unlike the right-wing parties.

And yes, I don't have what you just said in my personal environment, because I already have a very moralized, stable, familiar environment, thank God.\n But I also see that friendships are just starting to break apart, that relationships are breaking apart. Uhm, so it's this 7th of October is like a kind of\n seizure.\n And we don't know where it leads to,\n but definitely it has massive effects\n on Germany. And I think we notice that\n very special and I don't know if many other people in this country\n are aware of\n what's actually happening here.\n How did you experience the 7th have you experienced the last few weeks since October 7th?\n To be honest, I haven't been able to know how I'm doing since October 7th.\n The truth is that I haven't been able to sleep properly since October 7th,\n I forget to eat, I'm continuously just hanging on to the news.\n It started with the attack on October 7th, but it went on all the time, uninterrupted.\n The events have overshadowed each other and to be honest, there wasn't a single day in this whole month so far\n when you had the chance to stop for a moment short time and think about what is happening right now.\n It's far too much and I think this shock state, I'm talking about myself, but I know that many people\n have it right now and also have physical symptoms, but we are certainly better off than the people on site.

They have no police children and the children have to pass by the settlements.\n And it often came to situations where settlers attacked these children on the way to school.\n Some of them were international observers, which led to the children being accompanied by the Israeli military to school so that settlers cannot attack them.\n What I want to add is that in this place, Masar Faryata, every morning, or probably not at the moment, but were until October 7th,\n a group of activists every morning, including especially Jewish activists and Jewish Israelis who have divided up and went there in the morning to accompany these Palestinian children and to function also captured by the Israeli army.\n They were insanely attacked.\n And by the way, one of the group was killed in the Hamas attack.\n But I always had the feeling that these encounters that take place,\n and there are also Palestinian people and Jewish-Israeli people who work together for Palestinian rights,\n that this is actually not intended at all.\n Who doesn't want it?"

There were of course many big protests in Israel before October 7th\n and there were also solidarity protests worldwide and also in Berlin.\n And many have demonstrated with the Israeli flag and some thought, yes, we can't talk about Palestinians in these protests,\n because it's also part of the thing, when you spoke of the justice reform in Israel.\n And then there were also some who were on the move with the Palestinian flag,\n and they demonstrated together. They demonstrated together in Tel Aviv,\n and in New York, and in London London, everywhere. And in Berlin, the police just shared the two groups.\n Because they simply couldn't understand that they were demonstrating the Israeli and Palestinian flag together.\n For one future for all in this country.\n And in the end, they also sent back home with the Palestinian flag.\n But also with regard to Jewish activism in Palestine,\n it is also to be seen, especially in New York and London,\n what a big role Jewish activists play in solidarity with Palestinian demonstrations.\n There are these sit-ins in New York and London,\n which are organized by Jewish organizations. I don't know if we, Jewish activists, who are demanding an end to this war,\n if we really have room to do something like this here in Germany.\n Because it doesn't fit into the picture.\n Maybe because of that.\n You have, that's indisputable,\n because of the special responsibility,\n the historical responsibility of Germany for the Holocaust,\n that, so to speak, maybe that's why\n the German spiritual play is limited or limited itself. But isn't it just because of that that it is necessary to lead this discourse here?\n So you say, I don't know if there is room for it.\n I would now say, yes, that's exactly why you have to create this space with everything you have.\n Yes, but who creates it and who protects us?\n and who is protecting us.\n So if an Israeli woman, a Jewish Israeli woman, walks alone on Hermannplatz with a sign\n that she is against the war and is then arrested,\n then I ask myself, how, what could,\n so there is no room for something like that in the end. That wasn't even a demo. And very briefly, you just said that you thought about it with friends, to emm, really established people in this society who said, I can't imagine staying here right now.\n I mean, of course, the emotions are boiling up and hopefully they will all calm down at some point, this war has to end first. But many people, and not only personally affected people,\n who would like to participate in a political open discourse,\n feel completely restricted and useless.\n I was just with a friend who said she had a fever,\n because she had the feeling she was a Kurd and she is very political.\n She said she got a fever because she felt so helpless and wanted to do something, but also felt that she was somehow taken to the room to speak,\n was afraid to talk about it."

Two states. But then, obviously in dealing with Palestinian voices,\n and those who are bashing this right of existence of their state,\n such an inhibition or fear of having these voices come to the fore,\n to have them demonstrated.\n And we're not talking about anti-Semitic protests or terror glorifications, but simply...\n Yesterday or the day before yesterday, in Essen, how many were there?\n 3,000 Islamists were demonstrating.\n And they were allowed to do so. Did you see that?\n Yesterday in Berlin, 10,000 people were allowed to protest for Palestine.\n Yes, but I think half of the demos have been cancelled.\n But that's a fundamental problem, right?\n The politics always speaks of a two-state solution.\n You also implicitly recognize the existence of the right of Palestinians.\n I don't know how honest that is.\n To be honest, I don't know how honest politicians say that they are for the two-state solution.\n Or what do they really know about how practical it really is?\n I don't think it's practical.\n That's another question.\n We also had Omri B\u00f6hm here.\n You probably know both Omri.\n Omri always said that believing in the two in the two states is like denying climate change.\n So, denial of reality.\n No one really believes in it. In the first week, two weeks after the 7th of October, people in New Cologne were arrested because they had held the Palestinian flag.\n This is a flag of one of these potential two states.\n So what does that mean? That Germany is no longer a second state?\n Or, well, but about the solution itself, I think...\n We can talk about the solution later, but we are currently in the German discourse and how seemingly superficial and public the conflict is being discussed.\n I don't know how much people know about it in Germany, for example, that's just one example of many, about what is happening in West Jordan.\n Even if you believe in a two-state solution, West Jordan should be part of Palestine in this region, you have to say the settlers, the Israeli right-wing extremists,\n October 7th for them was day X. Yes, so that was the day that from that day on everything is allowed to them.\n And the violence against the Palestinians in West Jordan has increased so much in the last four weeks that people from these villages just pack their things and leave.

The Israeli army in West Jordan\n has the ability to stop the settlers. That the settlers can do that, it is only because it is\n allowed to them, quite clearly.

And there is\n relatively little, except that it is said, yes, we support the UN resolution,\n which criticizes it, the occupation and so on.\n And the impression is that the federal government has this position politically,\n it goes and also articulates, but the Israeli government is passing by.\n They don't care if Germany says, or not, and makes an appointment.\n Europe and the USA say that too.\n Yes, in principle.\n But apparently the Israeli government doesn't see any reason to react to this position.\n And it does it, as you said, because it wants to and because a part of the government personnel is actually also placed by right-wing radical settlers.\n These are the two levels. And I think, I don't know if the association is acceptable, but it is rightly criticized that the Hamas in the West Jordan, also creates a parallel world insofar as the larger part of a Palestinian state is underhulled, is dismantled, is created by the creation of settlement structures, a different reality is actively created.\n Isn't that in a way comparable to what the Hamas in Gaza accuses?\n I think that when you talk about this parallel world in Gaza, you talk more about the whole city of tunnels under Gaza.\n Yes, that's clear. other reasons than what Israel is doing in West Jordan.\n But yes, I think that\n it is similar in the sense that as long as\n this government in Israel governs and as long as Hamas governs in Gaza,\n there is no solution. Not two states, not one state. I would like to ask something, because somehow we are just, I just heard, I don't know,\n we got so confused.

I had Gideon Levy, I will never forget that. worldwide and restricts it to one project.\n Exactly.\n I had Gideon Levy, I will never forget him, he is an Israeli, Jewish, HA-Retz\n journalist and columnist, he explained it to me like this,\n Zionism is over 100 years, 150 years old\n and\n Zionism was\n with the founding of the State of Israel.\n The Jews got their own state.\n The Zionist dream came true.\n And since then, especially with the occupation of the Israeli state before the 1967 borders.\n Yes, although from the beginning, I have arguments, also within the Zionist movement,\n about what this city should look like. And, for example, the opinion that it should be a multinational\n city was not radical at all at that time, even from the right of the Zionist movement. Jabotinsky, for example,\n he was a revisionist, the right wing of the Zionist movement and he thought of two\n parliaments, the Jewish parliament, the Arab Palestinian parliament, with different mechanisms how they can work together.\n Buber himself suggested a binational state,\n got the Peace Prize in Frankfurt 70 years ago.\n Herzl, if you read Herzl, he speaks of a multinational state,\n whose language is strangely German. So okay, strange, but\n after all, the way it looks now was really not necessarily the dream of\n the first Zionists, not to speak of non-Zionists back then. The fact is, historically, that Zionism was created under all over the world, by anti-Semitic forces,\n that's what the movement called for or strengthened. a self-sufficient statehood and that should take place in the historical region where the naturalization of Judaism has roots.\n I think that was the right approach. And then Zionism... the secure statehood has suddenly narrowed down to what we have now.\n Namely a statehood that is exclusively Jewish and partly right range that even the Zionism had.\n And the German state reason, I am interested in what Alena understands below,\n if that is a term that can be used in a meaningful way. And the German state reason actually falls into or narrows itself to this narrowed term of Zionism.\n So the German term of state reason, starting with Merkel,\n taps into a trap that one has set oneself. Is that the criticism?\n that you have put yourself in. Is that the criticism?\n Uhm...\n I have to think about something.\n Yes, yes.\n Uhm...\n Well...

I'd rather look at the situation as it is. I understand where this state reason comes from.\n I think we should discuss this much more often and openly, what this term should mean for Germany,\n also in view of the changing political realities.\n But for me it is actually important that people always stand before states.\n And I think the interests of a state should never be more important than the dignity and security and basic human rights.\n And if that starts to contradict itself, then it is perhaps a point at which one should discuss this again. For me, the German state reason must primarily be to ensure that Jewish people and other\n marginalized groups are safe in Germany and that Germany is committed to making it strong\n that human rights are implemented all over the world.

I think that in the last years,\n NSU, Halle, Hanau, Walter L\u00fcbcke,\n Nazi Telegram groups, the police and so on and so forth,\n nevertheless, it is somehow always called imported.\n Even by Hubert Aiwanger it was called imported.\n Maybe not with the word imported, but...\n Import from France, probably.\n Yes, exactly.\n And yes, that's dangerous. That's dangerous for us, for Jews in this country.\n Because German right-wing extremism is ignored?\n Yes, and also because the term anti-Semitism changes.\n And this changes the fight against anti-Semitism, too, obviously. I don't know. It seems like in the last years, since there have been, for example,\n commissioners for anti-Semitism in every country and also in the federal government,\n it seems as if they are really conducting political debates about Israel all the time. And that doesn't make me safer, so to speak.\n What would make you safer?\n Well, if right-wing extremist forces are taken seriously here and not described as, how do you say that, single-minded?\n Single-minded. for, what we have already discussed, for Jews and Jewish organizations\n to sit together with Palestinians and Palestinian organizations and discuss things,\n because if we can't do that, what it feels like right now.\n Do you have a few positive aspects in the German debate culture about the East conflict?

We turn away from them.\n And I don't think anyone has any political vision.\n I want to say one thing briefly.\n Because I recently thought about it.\n I have now before October 7th,\n I wake up every morning and look for the first time what happened in Palestine tonight.\n And it's always the same pictures.\n It's always the same pictures it's always the same pictures you\n know them too the videos from last night somewhere is an israeli military jeep in the refugee camp\n in the city in the village in the west jordan land you see children young men who throw stones or\n with colored glasses or maybe molotov cocktails on this military jeep. Sometimes you see Palestinians being taken off with blindfolded eyes,\n sometimes you see a 17-year-old bleeding on the ground.\n When this is documented, you will read in the Israeli daily newspaper the next day\n that the Israeli army says it will investigate.\n We all know that in most cases it will not be investigated.\n This is everyday life in the West Jordan country. I'm talking about before October 7th, now it's all a little different.\n Last year was the anniversary of the first Intifada. When was the first Intifada? 1987?\n 1987.\n When you were born, right?\n Yes.\n And then many pictures were shared and I thought, wow, these are exactly the same fucking pictures. It's the Palestinian child in a retro 80s wool sweater with a carrot jean\n that throws a stone on a retro military jeep.\n These are exactly the same pictures.\n And it's almost 40 years ago.\n These are exactly the same pictures when you look at the pictures from 1948.\n These are the same pictures. And then I think to myself, this child in this picture of 87\n is now maybe a 50-year-old man\n who still lives in this refugee camp\n and his child is now throwing stones against the military jeep.\n And the 18-year-old soldier from the military jeep\n is now, I don't know, in his house in Caesarea\n or he is a minister. I don't know.\n But nothing has changed from a Palestinian perspective.\n It was always the same pictures.\n And then there is the point where you have to ask yourself,\n how can it actually be that the same pictures are always reproduced?\n Either because Palestinians are genetically so designed to come to the world and want to throw stones at military jeeps and possibly be killed, that would be the logical conclusion.\n Or you ask yourself, what is the context or what are the circumstances that lead to the same images being produced over and over again?\n By the way, before there was Hamas and before there was Netanyahu.\n And even before 1948. The images you describe were in Palestine, British mandate area, in 1929.\n Only the military jeeps were from the British. Yes, the military jeeps were from the British, but in 1929, when we were under the pressure of anti-Semitism in Germany\n and the promises of the British, the opposite promises to the Jews, to their own Jewish state in the region,\n as well as to the Arabs on their own Arab state in the region.\n These promises, completely contrary, have been made by the English since 1913.\n Then there was, under the impression of international antisemitism,\n there was a migration of Jewish settlers into the region.\n Then in the 1920s there was a time of, one could say, coexistence of the two groups.\n And then in 1929 there was a violent confrontation."

Yes.\n Which would not work again or would not go up with this concept, which it is now.\n And that's why ...\n I just wanted to say that. That's always the argument.\n I mean, I also have many friends in Israel who say two states are impossible.\n But at the same time, if it were one state, there would be at least 50-50 Jews and non-Jews in this state.\n Give a little credit to the Orthodox Jews that they will eventually become a majority.

I think there are many reasons why Netanyahu is always voted for.\n One of them is that he is a pretty good hater. He hates demonstrators, the left, the Supreme Court.\n Even now during the war he takes no responsibility and has also accused the military and the Shin Bet and blaming the whole world. And except for himself.\n The secret service.\n Exactly, the secret service.\n And it's not good.\n Many believe in it, unfortunately.\n I still believe that they are radicalizing totally in Israel.\n Especially,\n this is my opinion now,\n especially because you look at the pictures from Gaza\n and you have to explain to yourself, among other things, why we are doing this.\n And then we see a very strange phenomenon, that in the last days, in the last week maybe,\n new stories from the 7th of Of course, four weeks later,\n no new corpses are found on site.\n But nevertheless, now stories are appearing again,\n and much more terrible than before,\n which may be true, I don't know, but I won't\n spread it as true, it's irresponsible.\n And I don't know if they're not true, where do they come from?\n And this is definitely useful for radicalisation.\n And I'm afraid that as soon as Netanyahu leaves, and that's a big possibility, because there's this huge anger against Netanyahu, but that it's actually still going further to the right.\n Will the pictures we see see that, the suffering.\n We have of course also seen the horror of October 7th.\n In Al Jazeera, the dead children of October 7th were not shown, the burned people, for example.\n How is that in Israel in relation to the bombings of Gaza?\n The pictures from Gaza are shown in Haaretz.\n It's a newspaper, yes.\n It's a newspaper, it's a newspaper that tends to the left.\n Except Haaretz, I don't think it's shown anywhere.\n On TV? Israelis get these pictures, but rather via Telegram or newspapers outside the country.\n Or Haaretz.\n What about radicalization in the Palestinian population. You just said there are so many young Palestinians\n who actually say no perspective at all.\n Does this lead to resignation and agony\n or is there at least one part\n in activist political radicalization?\n I wouldn't want to make a concrete statement,\n because I haven't researched that.\n But I'm very sure that lack of perspective, injustice,\n the feeling of not being heard,\n form a good foundation for radicalization.\n I am very, very sure of that. In recent months or I don't know exactly,\n maybe for the last one and a half years, there has been this phenomenon, especially in the occupied West\n Jordan country, that young people, very, very young people,\n were completely warned off by Hamas, Fatah and all these parties and were quasi\n armed on their own and then, for example, when the military was watching at night,\n especially in Nablus or in the Jenin camp, when the military arrived,\n they also fired and so on and so forth.\n So they have quasi radicalized themselves, but independently of these parties.\n Of course, every party always tries to portray this person as a martyr for this party when someone dies,\n and then somehow put the flag on it, but the phenomenon was more that they said, we want to fight with weapons, but we no longer really believe in the individual parties.\n But I think, I am convinced that what is happening in Gaza will also provide the absolute perfect ground for a massive radicalization. But at the moment people have to survive.\n We will see the consequences later.\n I would like to say briefly, you asked about the leaderships.\n Abbas is officially the Palestinian president.\n Pro forma, exactly.\n I think it's important to emphasize that the last elections took place in 2006.\n I think that is too rarely mentioned in Germany.\n All my friends who live in Palestinian areas have never voted in their lives.\n They didn't vote for Hamas and they didn't vote for Abbas either.\n That means that a large part of the killed in Gaza have never voted for Hamas.\n There were simply the last elections in 2006.\n In view of the fact that half of the population in Gaza is under 18.\n Exactly.\n They weren't even living."

This behavior is not good for Israeli democracy and may contribute to the radicalization of Israeli society.\n\nRegarding the Palestinian population, the lack of perspective and injustice experienced by young Palestinians can form a good foundation for radicalization. The phenomenon of young Palestinians arming themselves independently of political parties and engaging in violent confrontations with the Israeli military has been observed in recent years. The current conflict in Gaza is expected to provide the perfect ground for a massive radicalization, but at the moment, people in Gaza are focused on survival.\n\nIt's important to note that the last Palestinian elections took place in 2006, and a large part of the population in Gaza, especially the younger generation, have never voted in their lives.

No, but that's ...\n That's also a paradox of democracy.\n Whether you can democratically choose an undemocratic party and whether that ...\n How does democracy fare against something like that?\n Well, every country has different solutions.\n At least you can still vote in Israel.\n Yes, we will see how it goes here in a few years.\n There is also an undemocratic party here that is getting stronger and stronger.\n And how does the German democracy react to this?\n Alina, why don't the partisans in the West Bank in Gaza stand up and ask for elections?\n There was a question that you saw in the preview. Why don't the people in Gaza stand up and get rid of themselves?\n You can say that Hamas has been suffering again and again in the last 15 years because of the Israeli counter-reaction.\n Why do they say, you tried it 5-6 times and told us we have to send our God-Warriors into the supposed resistance against this occupation.\n It never worked. Can you explain that to us?\n Why don't they say, okay, get out of here, we're going to do it differently now?\n I think if there was a perspective and an alternative, I can imagine that this would happen.\n I've never been to Gaza, I'm not allowed to go to Gaza. I tried twice, but because I'm an Israeli citizen, Israel doesn't let me go to Gaza. I can't imagine how the situation in Gaza is.\n I only know that the UN has already foreseen for 2020\n that Gaza will no longer be habitable.\n I think the circumstances under which people live there are so unimaginable.\n So even my colleagues from the West Bank, and that's difficult,\n they had permits in between and were allowed to go to Gaza.\n They said it was the worst thing to see,\n that people have to live in Gaza.\n I don't know what to expect from these people in this state.\n And secondly...\n It wasn't an expectation, but rather a question of why...\n I think it's because it's survival.\n I think it's survival and I think...\n This would be too complicated and I didn't do any research on Hamas.\n But I think there's a misunderstanding that as if they were so mercenaries, or like in the IS, people who came from another country to fight,\n who you can just kill and then they're gone. Even if it's hard for me to say that,\n but it's also part of Palestinian society. These people, these Hamas fighters were children who were born and raised in Gaza.\n And yesterday I learned that many of them are also wise, who were also consciously recruited,\n because they lost their families in the past wars.\n I don't think that you can bomb Hamas, if you understand it as an ideology, or get rid of it. But I still think, I am convinced that you have to change circumstances.\n Should you reach out to this terror band? No. No. But you have to offer people a perspective, I think.\n Not Hamas as a terror organization, but offer people in Gaza a perspective. Because what could be worse than a population that has nothing to lose,\n that is not afraid of death because their life is worthless. You have to understand where it comes from\n if you want to get rid of the shit. Otherwise you just stay in there.\n And why don't people call for elections, even in the West Jordan country, they do, partly.\n I lived there in 2021, elections should have taken place there, everyone was very excited, NGOs made election videos.\n But then it was like that the PA and Israel allegedly could not agree whether East Jerusalem to vote yes or no. I don't know if that was a premeditated reason, because actually everyone is interested in the PA staying\n and maybe the fear was too great that Hamas would win.\n You don't know.\n But many in my environment were very excited in 2021,\n because they thought they could vote for the first time and it didn't happen.\n But then there is the fact that people also know that Israel has the final control.\n And that's why you can't take the Palestinian politicians, if you live there, seriously.\n Because you know, what can you decide? You don't control the borders, you don't control the resources.\n And in the end, the Israeli army can go to every city and village every night\n and take people, let's say for security reasons,\n with them and arrest them."

            "reference_answer": "\nThe reasons why Palestinians in Gaza, particularly Hamas fighters, continue to resist Israeli occupation are complex and multifaceted. Some argue that it is a matter of survival and self-preservation. Hamas fighters were born and raised in Gaza, and many were consciously recruited due to the loss of their families in past wars. They see themselves as part of Palestinian society and believe that they are fighting for their land and people.\n\nAs for why Palestinians in Gaza, and more broadly in the West Bank and Gaza, don't call for elections despite the UN's prediction that Gaza will be uninhabitable by 2020, there are several reasons. One reason is that they don't believe that elections would make a difference, as Israel has the final control over the borders and resources. Additionally, there have been instances where elections have not been allowed to take place due to disagreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel over whether East Jerusalem should be allowed to vote. This has led to frustration and a lack of trust in the political process.\n\nAnother reason is that many Palestinians feel that they have nothing to lose. The circumstances under which they live are so",

I think that you need a very clear definition of antisemitism\n so that you can speak freely without being afraid that you are crossing this line.\n That is a fear that prevents the discussion, the debate.\n What would be the definition?\n Yes, there has to be a debate.\n Who should lead?\n Yes, I didn't say it's easy. It's difficult. I think this is indeed a discussion that should have been taking place in Germany for several years.\n And now it is really necessary. The definition that was officially chosen by Germany, their definition, I mean,\n is a definition that prevents this discussion and doesn't let it develop.\n And that's why you have to question this definition a little bit.\n That's the first step, I would say.\n So that we can really speak freely without being afraid that we are anti-Semites.\n And I'm afraid of of that in Germany.\n That I say something...\n But you are Jewish.\n That is no guarantee anymore.\n I would like the debate about Israel and Palestine to be less about Germany and German identities,\n but rather to look at what is happening there and to talk to to talk about their fears and concerns, which are\n really justified. I also wish that Palestinian people in Germany would be seen. I think what\n is happening right now is absolutely very, very, very harmful. When Palestinian people have no room\n to go out on the street for the rights of the Palestinians,\n to stop the police, well, sometimes that was allowed now,\n but it is always criminalized.\n Many people are afraid to go to demos\n because they are afraid that they will be photographed\n and that it will be printed somewhere\n and then they will have a problem later if someone says something anti-Semitic at the demo,\n which has nothing to do with them.\n And I wish that Germany would deal more with its own right-wing movement,\n deal more honestly with anti-Semitism within the German majority society\n and that this debate is not projected so overly on e-marginalized groups.\n Because I believe that exactly what is happening right now is that a lot of young people don't feel seen and develop incredible anger and frustration.\n They completely lose their trust in the media and politics and that is very dangerous.\n And I don't know if German politics is aware of this.\n I don't think so.

I can't explain that at all, because I honestly don't understand it.\n Didn't the fathers of the Constitution think about it?\n They had a good reason for it, as I said, from their historical experience.\n They didn't want to equip him with too much power.\n They didn't want it to become a fight between the Chancellor and the Federal President.\n I think that it shouldn is no longer allowed.\n We have a really established democracy for 70 years now\n and people are now so far that they could decide their state themselves.\n On the contrary, who else should we vote for ourselves?\n And it works in the communities and in the districts.\n Interestingly, when it comes to a mayor, people don't just join a blind party,\n but they really choose the personalities that they think are most capable.\n And that usually works.\n And I don't see such a big difference between a mayor of Munich or Hamburg or Berlin and a federal president. Maybe even a mayor has more daily problems on his neck\n that he has to solve than a federal president.\n So I can't explain why the people shouldn't vote themselves.\n On the contrary, at the moment I have the feeling that this even contributes\n to political tension.\n And if I hear today that a of the voters nominated his father,\n so that he could get out of the house a little bit,\n that another voter, an earlier prime minister, even said no,\n because he is sick with a cold, and that there are union voters who say,\n actually I would prefer to get sick on Sunday\n because I would be ashamed to have to vote for Mr. Steinmeier."

No, I didn't have to argue with Sarah about this post.\n It was clear that she would become the chairman of the party and that she would take on this job.\n And insofar as the job has just been released, my predecessor Eva Bulling-Schr\u00f6ter\n didn't get elected to the Bundestag anymore. And I thought it was a good opportunity as a new member of parliament to keep a lot of talks and to train there and to get in there at all.\n And that has also been fulfilled a bit.\n In my opinion, since Fridays for Future, the climate issue is no longer to be thought of from the big media.\n How often do you get talk show invitations and so on?\n Talk show invitations not really yet.\n We have a lot of press, public, a few interviews, bigger talk show invitations, not yet.\n So I think the last time I was really in a talk show was as a student.\n But I don't think that's the talk show was as a student.\n But I don't think that's the central thing to be politically effective.\n But it would be nice if you could speak as a Lika politician who is an expert on climate.\n Sure, that would be nice and I'm open to that.\n But for me, other things matter.\n For me, things like being able to represent the position publicly, but also being present and scientist, then you wanted to be this and then that.\n What did you want to do after school? You did your Abi, right?\n I did my Abi. I come from Trittau, that's the edge of Hamburg, Speckg from the village, so to speak, and I did the first political steps there.\n You went to a village school or what?\n No, we didn't have that anymore, but centrally in this place, Trittau, near Hamburg, there was a central school, a central school complex, where it was then called real school, primary school,\n gymnasium and the elementary school were then almost all on one place.\n And the gymnasium was still 12 years or 13 years old, Abi?\n That was 13. The experiments came later.\n And good thing it was 13?\n I'm completely satisfied with that and I think I also with that. And I think I also needed that.\n I don't keep anything from this idea of \u200b\u200bschool just in time and studying just in time.\n But I do believe that it is also a bit about self-development.\n Were you already politically active during your school days? What did you do during your school days?\n Did you do school newspaper, student representation?\n The classics are of course the demo against the first, second, second Iraq war.\n The first was Iran-Iraq, the second then...\n 2003.\n No, no, no, no, no, the earlier one.\n There was one time, exactly, there was one time, wasn't it the second one?\n Wasn't there this Iran-Iran?\n Yes, yes, but it wasn't called the Iraq War.\n Ah, okay, okay, okay.\n Or the Gulf War was what it was called earlier.\n Ah, okay, good, exactly.\n So that was an experience. But very central for me and very impressive for me were the attacks that took place at that time.\n So Solingen, M\u00f6lln in particular. M\u00f6lln is a neighboring city. And then L\u00fcbeck. I know that when I was in L\u00fcbeck, I heard it on the radio with my father and then asked him to go there.\n And L\u00fcbeck is still not the fire strike, so to speak, cleared up.\n And this series was very impressive for me and at the same time I was only in the youth of the\n federal environment and nature protection of germany and then later I founded the green alternative youth\n for third parties and the environment together with others, because it didn't exist at that time\n and we just did the typical bit, environmental politics,\n but also on the issue of war crimes, anti-militarism and the like.\n That was still an issue with the Greens back then.\n So you grew up quite green. Did you come from a household like that?\n Actually, I don't come from a green household, it just happened that way.\n My mother is originally a teacher and is now active in the union."

Well, my rebellion was the Green Alternative Youth.\n Because it would have been something close to red.\n And I said, yeah, edge, I'm rebellious and go and do the Green Alternative Youth.\n And were your parents angry?\n Well, my father didn't like it with the Greens. not so great and said yes, they will eventually take the path of adaptation, which was then\n also 98 99 with the Schr\u00f6der-Fischer-Region then also came but for me it was\n the right way back then and from there it went from the university to the student movement, so to speak.

I actually started with VWL and thought VWL could be something for me.\n But I realized relatively quickly that I had imagined the direction differently.\n Everything was very focused on a purely market-economic and neoliberal theory at that time.\n And there were few professors who saw it differently.\n Yes, but the market view has been through.\n Yes, it has already been through at that time.\n With 1989 capitalism won and as the philosopher Francis Fukuyama said, it was the end of the story.\n Exactly.\n Exactly.\n Done.\n We can stop with the interview.\n Exactly.\n Good.\n But even if you had a problem with it, you could have done it again at the Bundeswehr.\n You just look at it and understand it, understand it fine and so on.\n Yes, also a nice idea there was\n actually once I think also in the 60s 70s years a link in the Bundeswehr to learn the service\n on the weapon somehow and to get in there and understand the enemy but I don't think so\n much about it I prefer to make the Bundeswehr superfluous in the long run.\n There's always a running gag in the interviews that says that the young people of Fridays for Future should go to the CDU.\n And the CDU from below. You need a few thousand of some East German federal associations and then you have a majority.

No, it's not.\n You go into a party, ideally with a certain position, and look at yourself.\n Okay, I might have 70, 80 percent agreement, that could be something. And yet there are things that have to be changed and where you want to change positions, where you want to change structures, for the meeting as a bit of the processing of the agenda.\n agenda point 1 welcome, agenda point 2 protocol of the last meeting, farewell, protocol and so on and so forth.\n Top 12 then different.\n And there is a lot of time spent on it, where you could actually see that you can find a better balance between going out, doing actions, convincing people and working out the agenda.\n But you ended up with the Greens first, right?\n I ended up in the youth. But then in 1998 we had a party and celebrated Rot-Gr\u00fcn and hoped that it wouldn't get so bad and that the Oscar would be a bit corrective to Schr\u00f6der and that Schr\u00f6der would not go through with his line, which was already a bit recognizable at that time.

Yes, obviously party.\n That's the rich boat exactly the rich boat in which many social assistance recipients\n are where many migrants are and then the vote is somehow at 19 at 20 percent\n we have also taken away good votes but those who determine the politics are those who have voted 79 percent.\n And in the other areas, people are partly not reached by politics anymore.\n That means, how do I reach them? How can I get into these districts?\n How can I talk to these people brings back what we just talked about,\n such as contractual contracts, lease work and other things.\n And a left-wing party will have to measure whether it will bring about real change.\n But tell us, if you say how,, how can, how can, how can?\n I just said that.\n On the one hand, go in, talk to the people directly,\n have door-to-door conversations\n and be active on site.\n And on the other hand,\n also make measures that\n really improve the situation.\n For example, a overcoming of\n Hartz IV, away with the sanctions regime.\n And others, either a conditional basic income For example, a overcoming of Hartz IV, away with the sanctions regime.\n And others, either a conditional basic income or a sanction-free minimum insurance at least.\n A pension from which everyone can live.\n The end of the two-class medicine and similar things.\n So things that bring fundamental justice back into society and strengthen the social cohesion.\n And then the others have to think about whether I should think out any problems\n or do I want to go back into the democratic discourse.\n But G\u00f6sta, now the left is already in some countries, whether here in Berlin or Thuringia, you have a prime minister.\n That's not different from other countries or federal governments without the left.\n Yes, then we might have to talk about political understanding.\n My political understanding is not that if a left goes into government, everything will automatically get better.

Germany is historically the\n fourth largest climate polluter.\n And if we say, let's go on like this for a little longer,\n then other states say, yes, then we'll go on a little longer too.\n And then nothing changes fundamentally.\n And such a government has to turn the lever.\n In all social areas and also in the climate.\n Let's get back to it. Why did you say goodbye to the left?\n You said goodbye to the Greens at the end of the 90s because of Kosovo.\n Did you go to the left afterwards? You didn't exist yet.\n I didn't go directly to the left, I first looked at the PDS, but I then focused mainly on student politics.\n And then I took the WASG as a great opportunity, i.e. the alternative work and social justice,\n on the one hand as a split from the SPD and especially in Schleswig-Holstein with other forces and thought\n that this would bring a little dynamism to the party landscape and then I went the way to the\n joint left and was also the first chairman of state then in schleswig-holstein\n I think you were in the parliament in schleswig-holstein i think you were in the parliament in schleswig-holstein not\n that means now you are the very first ever deputy and then immediately a federal\n party before you were not a county deputy city council but as I said you can\n do politics differently and practice politics differently and I understand my politics in a different way than the switch between movement and parliament."

No, that's not an option.\n But you asked first about antifascism and why a climate movement has to be antifascist and antiracist.\n That's a bit related to history, to colonialism. colonialism together and that the resources the fossil resources that heat up our climate\n in which we heat them and thus also our future that the exploitation\n conditions from the global south come that they come together with corresponding environmental\n conditions corresponding social consequences and finally\n then also with the consequences of the climate change, the strongest, so meanwhile it comes\n here too, the climate change in Germany, but the strongest they meet the global south\n and then it is so if we simply make it concrete an Ethiopian family. A typical family eat as small farmers, have a small field, have children and then\n comes the milk that simply destroys the livestock from Europe and then comes the climate change.\n That means you have heavy rain and you have drought in the change.\n And the drought makes the earth dry out and the heavy rain then washes away the fertile crop, so to speak.\n And the family loses their livelihood.\n And then I should hurt him if he, for economic reasons, because it's about surviving, I want to find a good life somewhere else.\n And then I want to say as a European, hey, you're not coming in here because you're so-called economic refugees.\n They flee because of this lifestyle.\n And that's why it basically has to do with anti-racism\n and anti-fascism.\n Because this ideology\n that says we have a right to be here,\n we have a right to live at the expense of the global sense,\n I question it fundamentally.\n But what is more important in the end?\n That we take a democratic approach?\n Because we decide real climate protection too late in parliamentary majority or then\n maybe set up an eco-dictatorship for 20 years?

Then it was clear that this demand premium would come.\n As a result, old cars were scrapped and there were more powerful and larger cars that were bought.\n But the thing is now, on the one hand, the car industry will of course fight against the fact that an\n exit date for a combustion engine will come. At some point they will lose and that will come.\n I hope it's not too late that they lose.\n Yes, but still, if they are interested in it, then we want to sell our e-cars.\n Yes, of course.\n But the goal, according to you and other climate researchers, is less cars in itself.\n How do you get the cars from the streets?\n You have to make the public transport, I said earlier, more attractive.\n You have to expand it, you have to convert cities differently. For example, there is a very exciting thing in the Netherlands.\n There are some towns that are converted so that the cross-country roads are closed. That means you can come to the town hall with your bike in\n five minutes. No problem at all. You can't get through by car, but you would have to drive around\n with the car and then you would have to drive around for 20 minutes with the car, because you have to\n go around the city once. That means you can take building measures you can first prohibit that\n burners are on the way in the cities and then you can more roads around in\n traffic-free traffic-free zones you can create an attractive offer on the land\n example with us in schleswig-hololstein, the community of Sprackeb\u00fcll,\n they are currently testing an autonomous bus. That's a six-seater, I've already driven it.\n It drives 25 km h, it's learning now, it's just getting started. When it's done in a\n or two years, they said, it's used to actually drive people to the station, to drive older people to the doctor and the like.\n That means you have to do things like that in addition to legal measures.\n Incidentally, it also helps me when, or at least it helps a little,\n if you have an SUV with 700 hp afterwards that knocks out the energy, the electricity like nothing good\n and then brings another two or three tons on the scale, but I think\n that you also have to make laws and regulations that SUVs are at least the very rare exception.\n But it is being regulated on our roads.\n That's a problem too.\n You can also legislatively impose there.\n There are the most different measures.\n You can do electrification in the cities,\n you can do overpasses,\n you can reactivate highways.\n I think in Kiel the highways were dismantled in 1987.\n Absolute nonsense. Of course, the car lobby took over because they had no interest in alternatives.\n And you can create the conditions for that that you will not be driven by car because you know how much how much percent here in berlin\n roads that are under two kilometers are no every third route that is put back in berlin\n is under two kilometers it is an absurdity so i mean in 2-2.5 you can go 2 km on foot.\n You don't even need a piece of junk on two wheels like an electric scooter.\n Or you can borrow a bike or whatever."

No idea, I wouldn't say that, but I would actually say\n it's a massive difference between tempo 50 and tempo 30, which can be a difference in the whole.

We already had that with colonialism.\n There is a basic thing about injustice and exploitation. And that is exactly why you don't just have to make measures\n that we have just talked about, like in the transport sector and other areas, but rather a fundamentally different distribution of income and wealth in this society in order to change something about it. increasing progressive income tax, top tax rate and the like,\n are the first measures that can be taken.\n That means that they really ask for the cash in our society, which has been relieved for too long.\n And now in the Corona crisis we have also seen that the large assets are just growing and yesterday evening quite coincidentally\n because before I watched a video of you, hey, any other broadcaster was on\n no idea who put it on before world of wonder or something like that obviously\n I have never seen before and there was a documentation about nico rossberg\n I think this race driver and he grew up in monaco and so on and then he said yes and we\n are now making our electricity green here and use the water heat of the sea's water heat\n and do a lot for the climate,\n like they want to do on Fridays for Future.\n And then stood in front of the yacht port\n where you saw all the really fat yachts in Monaco.\n All electrically driven.\n Yes, of course.

No, you're right.\n Because at the beginning, when I started researching, in 2013,\n the American government spoke of civil victims in the single-seater area.\n And that was one of the reasons why I started researching,\n because I couldn't imagine it.\n Drones were used very intensively at that time\n the first armed drone attack was supposed to be at the end of 2001 at the beginning of 2002 and then\n they still talk about civilian deaths in the independent area in 2013, so it doesn't fit together and in my film myself\n I also have victims and civil victims visited afghanistan and alone with this one attack\n on the drone with the drone played a very big role 23 people were killed\n civilians and including children but I've always learned that the Americans don't declare that as a civilizist,\n but rather as collateral damage.\n Or if men were there, they were considered combatants or something.\n Yes, that's the problem.\n So who is counted as a victim at all?\n That is one of the protagonists of my film Daniel.\n So his job was to look for high-value targets for a special unit.\n He describes in the film that a high-value target is one person.\n But especially in these countries, these individual people, especially when they know that they are being persecuted or that they are being thrown at them, not alone.\n They are very often in a group of people.\n And these people will then simply,\n if they were killed in such a bombing,\n are seen as collateral damage.\n And then, even if mistakes happen, it is not always clear\n how they will be called at the end.\n Whether they are considered civil victims or collateral damage.\n There is far too little information with the drone program.\n You just indicated that it started with the film, because you saw that there are a few civilized people as victims.\n Yes, that was something that was so irritating to me,\n that didn't fit together.\n And then at the time, 2013, when I started,\n there was really almost no information from the program.\n There were articles in the newspaper,\n comments from politicians, from experts on the subject.\n It was all more on a theoretical level."

She flew her first mission when she was 20 years old, making the decision to drop a bomb a stressful experience for her. The image quality can be so poor that it is difficult to recognize the gender or age of the people in the footage, let alone what they are wearing.

But the Americans are the country that really leads the drone war in so many countries.\n And the reason why they do it, in my opinion, is because it is of course easy.\n So you can just fly with these drones to other countries, borders and you don't have to be afraid that\n American soldiers die who are on the ground and then afterwards there are these pictures\n that politicians really don't like at all, namely from sergans who then where the\n American flag is draped around so from that perspective I can understand it.\n But if you think strategically about the use, the use of drones,\n you also have to look at the overall strategy.\n And the overall strategy should actually be the reduction of terror.\n And my question is whether the drones really do that.\n If you are active in so many countries where people in these countries really know exactly\n and are also afraid of the sky, are afraid of the threats, are afraid of these attacks,\n does that really lead to a reduction of terror?\n One of the protagonists from my film, Lisa, who was also in Afghanistan,\n has said several times during interviews and events,\n can you really fight terror with terror?\n And what is the definition of terror?\n So what we saw in Afghanistan, how people feel it on the ground,\n they feel it as terror because they are afraid, because it changes society,\n because the children are afraid.\n We heard that the plane was flying in the air.\n It was very high, very dark. I was in a high place, in the middle of the night. I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.\n I was in a high place, in the middle of the night.

We don't want to have a war anymore.\n And that's what I think we can really take with us here, so this value of peace,\n this value that we have here, that is simply something so valuable and\n that is something that is special for many people in the world and there are also many\n people and I'm not saying that there are no terrorists, and there and there are also many people and I don't say\n that there are no terrorists yes of course there are and there are also people who attack\n but there is also the civilian population and that is simply sat has there is this\n saying i don't know from general mcchrystal or something he means every for every drone attack\n where we kill civilians we get three new terrorists\n out of it now it sounds to you as if that is not the case so my view of the this war and\n also what I hope what comes across in the film is that it is not there is no easy answer\n yes so the people the people also in these target countries, they're not all the same."

Was shooting in the US with American protagonists a problem? Did you get annoyed or was life difficult for you? Yes, it was a very, very difficult situation.\n It was an incredibly difficult production.\n It was a secret production for the entire production,\n because the American government also tried to intimidate the protagonists.\n And that was an, intense attempts. So during the production, in the middle of the production,\n the production initially had Heather or her family visited by the\n Air Force Office for Special Investigations, so it's an investigation unit within the Air Force and then she came to her family in person.\n So Heather was at the time, or I was on the road with their family appeared and said yes the heather\n is somehow in danger and she should rather be careful what she speaks about publicly and\n then they said they should have low social profile so just say a little on facebook or\n on twitter and should also write any comments either.\n So she wrote a comment for the internet during the production\n and she should rather keep it because it would be too dangerous for her.\n And in the beginning it even seemed that she was so,\n so really, the parents were so scared because it seemed as if she were on\n some kind of killing list or something by some terrorists.\n And luckily she already had a lawyer by that time.\n And that's the same lawyer who represents Edward Snowden, Jesselyn Radek.\n And Jesselyn Radek then called this OSI, the people in charge, and then checked in.\n And said, what's going on there on, what kind of danger was there.\n And suddenly the story sounded completely different.\n They said, yes, it's actually not that dangerous.\n And no, it's not a direct danger now.\n And no, no murder list at all. Some person who somehow has contact with a known terror network,\n they would have googled her.\n So googled her name.\n So it all sounds very weird.\n And then shortly after that, Daniel, the other protagonist in my film, was searched by the FBI for spying.\n And that was of course the big shock during production.\n And then I had to talk to my lawyers because it was suspected that they would come to me next.\n So my lawyer told me, Sonja, get your head together, they'll knock on your door.\n And that was a time when that didn't happen.\n Because I think that there was the investigation at Daniel's,\n it took place after Snowden.\n The Obama administration had already started to prosecute journalists,\n and that didn't work well with the Americans, with the population.\n Whistleblowers are one thing, but journalists, limiting press freedom,\n that doesn't look good in the public eye.\n And I think that protected us then, but it was still a very difficult situation because then I don't trust\n any technology anyway and no cell phone and we use encryption but if you then\n know that your protagonist and most likely me too my team yes that we are\n goals then so it is that work is even more difficult.\n So just this awareness and this really justified paranoia that you then get is of course also very difficult psychologically.\n So you can see that it has also become part of the film, how Daniel deals with it."

Behind that is the interest\n of big companies,\n that they, for example,\n when they bring a new car on the market,\n it doesn't have to be allowed in Europe and then again in the USA.\n Here in Germany it is built with yellow indicators\n and in America with red indicators.\n They would like one approval for the common market,\n but they would save a lot of money.\n So it sounds like a great thing.\n If the corporations want that,\n I've always learned that if the corporations are happy,\n then the country is happy.\n And if it was just about such simple technical simplifications,\n then that would be a good thing.\n Unfortunately, there is a big but,\n because, as always,\n if you give lobbyists\n and lawyers of transnational\n companies the opportunity, then they try\n to put as much as possible in their interest\n in such agreements.\n And that's why they have much more\n in the proposals for this\n agreement, if you will, dictated\n than is necessary. So,\n for example, it is also discussed\n that the respective governments\n on both sides of the Atlantic\n have to open the markets for public orders\n for all public services\n for providers from both regions.\n This would then mean, for example,\n that if public transport has to be written off in German or French cities...\n That means if an S-Bahn is built?\n No, also the operation of the S-Bahn, the operation of buses and so on, that it has to be same as before, that the national states have their complete freedom to organize their health care as they want, or whether it will be compulsory privatization of services and health care.\n If you look at the American side, then of course American medical and hospital companies are pressing for it to come into business here in Europe.\n So far, everything has not yet been finished.\n What is also very problematic, which I find the most difficult in this whole agreement, is that the corporations are pressing for a kind of special justice. So international companies, international investors should get the opportunity to complain to governments and states if they make regulations that reduce their profits.\n What?\n Yes. There is also an example for this. There is a comparable agreement, for example, which is valid within the European Union for Germany and Sweden.\n And that is why the Swedish state-owned company Vattenfall is now suing the Federal Republic of Germany\n before an international trial for compensation of, I think, more than 3 billion euros because of the nuclear exit.\n Because that of course meant for Vattenfall that they had to put two nuclear power plants, with which they would still have a lot of money to earn.\n They won't earn the money now and that's why they're complaining."

The primary interest behind this agreement is to save costs for corporations, particularly in the automotive industry, by eliminating the need for separate approvals in different markets. However, concerns have arisen due to the involvement of lobbyists and lawyers from transnational corporations. The proposed agreement includes provisions for opening public markets for all public services to providers from both regions, which could potentially lead to compulsory privatization of services and healthcare in European countries. American medical and hospital companies are particularly pushing for this in Europe. Another controversial aspect is the creation of a special justice system for international corporations, allowing them to complain to governments and states for compensation if regulations reduce their profits. This system has already been criticized for its potential to undermine national sovereignty and the rule of law. Vattenfall, a Swedish state-owned company, is currently using a similar mechanism in an ongoing dispute with Germany over the nuclear exit.",

Such international courts of justice,\n the days behind closed doors,\n mostly at corresponding places in Washington or Geneva,\n are occupied by lawyers who in other cases\n are working for the same corporations under circumstances.\n They are working behind closed doors,\n the documents are not public,\n the witness interrogations are not public, civil society organizations cannot participate in these procedures.\n And what I find completely impossible, there is no possibility of appeal against the claims.\n That means there is no second instance.\n Such international courts of justice were invented decades ago to protect investors from industrial countries, poor countries and developing countries from sudden expropriation.\n But over time, an international lawyer elite has recognized, together with the corporate lawyers, that if you incorporate such things into such agreements, you can make a huge deal out of it. That's why there are now over 500 such procedures\n where all states are sued for compensation.\n For example, the Canadian government has been sued for compensation\n by the American daughter of a Canadian company\n because the Canadian government did not want to allow fracking in certain regions.\n So these special methods to get gas out of the earth,\n which is associated with a high risk of groundwater pollution.\n Now the Canadian government is sued by an anonymous secret hearing on compensation for damages.\n Or the Australian government is sued by a tobacco company, Philip Morris, because it prints shock images on cigarette packs.

The Canadian and Australian governments have also been sued for compensation by corporations over issues such as fracking and cigarette packaging, respectively.

No, they try to pay taxes on their profits as much as possible where they have to pay as little as possible.\n That's why, with all sorts of tricks, the taxes are stored in low-income countries.\n For example, there are extremely high profits in Ireland.\n Because in Ireland, only 12.5% of taxes fall on company profits and if you combine it with another company shift on the Virgin Islands or the Bahamas,\n then you even come to less than 3%.\n In this respect, unfortunately, you can no longer say that with taxes.\n What is going on with these corporations these days?\n They go where the get the least taxes, they want to make sure that the lowest rules are in place everywhere.\n Why do they want to make it so easy everywhere?\n Why do they want to make it harder for all the other normal citizens and workers?\n They have to work more and so on.\n Well, because it's from the point of view of those who are in the board of directors of the companies,\n their task is to increase the benefit for their shareholders.\n In other words, to raise the profits.\n If you can reduce the costs by having to pay less taxes,\n less wages, less environmental costs,\n then you can increase the profits.\n I learned from my business expert that they are forced,\n so these shareholders are forced to maximize their share rights.\n That's what they always say."

The Greens and the Lefts have been critical of the agreement from the beginning. The CDU, led by Angela Merkel, has not taken a clear stance on the issue, but historically, the party has been less critical of the TTIP than the SPD. Alexander Lindner, a CDU politician, has expressed support for the agreement. However, it is important to note that the term 'free trade agreement' is misleading, as there is already almost free trade between Europe and the USA, and the economic benefits of the proposed agreement are questionable. Reports suggest that even if all the desired outcomes are achieved, the economic growth increase would be below the measurable limit.",

Two lives? Two lives. One life is what I have to do today, the here\n and now. You gotta talk to someone in the government about this topic. The other part\n of my life is I spend a lot of time with youth in Germany. Really? Do a lot of town halls, talk about the importance of the German-American relationship.\n So you talk to people like me and even younger?\n Even younger.\n Even younger.\n Even younger.\n And you don't even know how old I am.\n You're a young guy, I know.\n I might be 16.\n You might be.\n I just did a town hall yesterday in Quedlinburg, which is in Sachsen-Anhalt, with a bunch of 16 and 17-year-olds. Tell us about what is a town hall yesterday in Quedlinburg which is in Sachsen-Anhalt with a bunch\n of 16 and 17 year olds. Tell us about what is a town hall? Town hall is where I\n get up and I say a little bit in German and then I do it either in German or\n mostly English and talk about my typical town halls. I walk around the kids, they\n ask questions. What do they want to know? They typically, well,\n I do broadly speaking two kinds. One is\n we talk about heroes. Heroes? Heroes. Super heroes?\n No, like heroes like Martin Luther King Jr. So I talk about my heroes, they talk\n about their heroes, and that was yesterday.\n Those are really good. Do sometimes both sides have the same heroes?\n Yeah. In fact, I asked yesterday, give me some of your names before I even open my mouth.\n And the first two names were Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks.\n Really?\n Two of my heroes. The other town hall I do, I say things like, okay, today is April,\n and these are the five things that I'm thinking about today,\n or the ten things that are really on my mind.\n And so those are really great opportunities.\n And I view that as sort of setting the stage for the future.\n Besides talking to the German youth, what else do you do as an ambassador here in Germany?\n You do in the here and now stuff, like the stuff you've got to do today,\n you do a lot of interaction with the government.\n The German government?\n The German government, the members of the Bundestag.\n I see a lot of representatives from industry, German and American.\n Why is that part of your job?\n People want to talk about the economy, how's the economy going in the United States. Do you tell them about it or can you help them? I try,\n I don't know if I can help them but I try to give my best shot. I'm a former\n banker so I think some people think that I know more than I in fact do know about\n markets and the economy so we talk about that a lot. We talk to members of the\n media a lot, all shapes and sizes.\n Yeah, so it's a variety.\n So really, we have a lot of internal meetings because we've got to deal with budgets and things like that.\n Tell me, I always wondered, how do you become an ambassador?\n It's a very good question.\n So in our system, about 20% of the ambassadors are like me.\n They're political appointees by the president.\n The other 80% are just like the German Foreign Service in that they are career ambassadors.\n They've spent their whole career as in the Foreign Service\n and and I might add some of the very best professionals I've ever been around.\n Why did why does somebody call you and ask you? I have no idea. I lived in\n Germany in the 90s as a private citizen so I had a sense of the place. Did you\n work here? I worked here. What did you do? I was a banker. For who?

            "reference_answer": "During the Cold War, the American military presence in Germany was significant as it was there to protect Western Europe and Germany from potential invasion. This presence led to the establishment of American houses, which were open institutions around Germany that provided Germans with a sense of what America was about through cultural programs, libraries, and movie screenings. The American military and their families lived in Germany for extended periods, leading to millions of Americans having meaningful history in the country. This history and the resulting cultural exchange have contributed to the strong friendship and relationship between Germany and America, with Germans and Americans sharing more similarities than differences. Today, the American military presence in Germany continues, but for different reasons, such as training with allies and getting to know each other better in a safe environment. American influence can still be seen in German culture, with foods like schnitzel and Weisswurst being popular among Americans.",

So we are, we, this administration is all\n for making progress and in fact a couple of years ago now,\n we signed quite successfully with Russia\n a new, what they call, START treaty,\n which was a further reduction in nuclear weapons.\n But the president in Prague laid out a very clear vision\n that his aspiration is to see someday\n a nuclear weapon-free world.\n And in fact, when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009,\n the citation referred specifically\n to that speech and that objective of the president.\n So.\n FRANK SCHILBACHER.\n The next point, why doesn't America,\n why don't they advocate that?\n I mean, North Korea, they have the bomb and they're madmen.\n Why does America not say, okay, why not get rid of all bombs\n so we're not afraid anymore?\n We don't have to be afraid of any state anymore.\n I mean, America would still have\n the biggest army in the world.\n Let's put North Korea aside for a minute\n because that's really what they say and what they claim\n versus what the reality\n is.\n It's very hard to know.\n They say they have the bomb, but we don't know?\n I'm not smart enough to know, honestly.\n But they say a lot of things, as you've seen over the past few weeks, and a lot of it is\n very dangerous and unnecessary.\n So let's hope that cooler heads prevail on North Korea and this thing that they realize\n that this is not a sensible path to be going on.\n As a general matter, again I refer to President Obama, he was very clear."

Absolutely not call it journalism.

There's no question. And it was not...\n Were people made responsible for it? I mean, I think there's not a single banker.\n I don't know about that, but I think what I'd look to maybe more explicitly is,\n have we regulated ourselves after the crisis in a way that we probably should have had ourselves regulated before the crisis?

You want to make sure that what you just went through,\n you never go through again. Exactly. But you also want to make sure that what you just went through, you never go through again. Exactly.\n But you also want to make sure that you are properly anticipating what the next crisis will be and that you're regulating also prospectively.\n Time will tell whether or not that's been done, but certainly we were not properly regulated.\n I think you could probably say that about the global financial industry, but certainly in the U.S.,\n and I think we're in a much better place today.\n And you put people in jail who were responsible for it.\n Yeah, well, I didn't do any, but I...\n Yeah, I mean, nobody went to jail. I mean, there were people, millions of people lost their homes\n or their savings, but nobody was made responsible, neither here in Germany nor in America.\n Do you think that's fair?\n Well, you'd have to look at every case. I'm not a prosecutor. A lot of people in our system in the United States, if you pick up the paper every day, you'll see a lot of people getting taken into account for insider trading as an example. And that's something that we've got to continue to be vigilant on. But again, I look to regulation as the key. Did we learn our\n lessons? Could we, with this regulation, could we have prevented the last crisis? And hopefully,\n can we prevent the next one as well? All right. Thank you. That was episode 36 with\n Philip Murphy.

This was a departure from the perceived greed and short-term focus that characterized the financial industry as a whole during the same period.\n\nHowever, following the 2008 financial crisis, there was widespread criticism that the financial industry had not been properly regulated, and that individuals and institutions responsible for the crisis had not been held accountable. In response, regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act were passed in the United States to prevent similar crises from occurring in the future.\n\nNicolls expressed the view that the financial industry, including Goldman Sachs, had learned from the crisis and was now better regulated, but it remains to be seen whether these regulations will be effective in preventing future crises.

I have a new guest. Who are you?\n My name is B\u00e4rbel Baas and I am the Federal President.\n What is the president of the German Bundestag? Yes, many say the head of the German Bundestag, but that's just a term.\n Because I'm not really a head.\n Why not?\n Because I would wish I could decide everything, but that's not the case.\n Yes, then you would be a dictator or something.\n Right, exactly. And I'm not. I was elected democratically by the members of parliament.\n And my main task is to lead the session.\n Many people know that, because they see me when I lead the session.\n But behind that is a big federal government.\n I am the head of that.\n The federal government has a total of 3,000 employees.\n A director helps me with that.\n A director of administration, so I don't have to do it alone.\n And the other thing is of course the representative tasks,\n that I represent the German Bundestag from the outside.\n We'll have to discuss everything, so that a little light comes into the dark.\n I think many people just don't know what a Bundestag president does.\n That's true.\n And you are even the second highest person in the German state by protocol. Yes, in the ranks of the constitutional organs I am number two behind the\n Federal President and in front of the Chancellor. Why is that?\n Yes, because I think the Federal President is the first\n head of state and the second institution elected by the people is the\n German Bundestag, which represents the people.\n Therefore a second place.\n And the third place is the government, the chancellor, the federal council and the federal constitution.\n Because the Bundestag elects the chancellor who sets up the government.\n Simple explanation. And not the other way around.\n But you're not the housemaster in the Bundestag who has a key to every room and every door?\n For God's sake, no I don't.\n But you have... I mean, of course you have...\n No, but I have the right to the house. So if that's a question, I also determine the access regulations.\n But there are also the committees for that. So we have, for example, one committee, which are the security officers.\n Every faction appoints an official who deals with security issues in the house.\n We have adjustments to the house order again and again, even if certain things happen, access.\n We had a small storm on the Bundestag, that was 2020, I think at the end of a corona demo.\n And then security measures are checked again and again, whether the house is safe, who comes into the house. These are rules that determine the house owner.\n Can you do that in a partial way? I don't want left-wing extremists or people of the last generation to have rights.\n No, no, that's why I just said there is a board of directors, that are the security officers, who consult with the federal police and the administration.\n I can make suggestions, as I imagine it, but the members of the board, who work as security officers for the factions,\n it's also about the safety of the members of the board in the house, they discuss these suggestions and then make a recommendation for the oldest council,\n or in that sense for me, by then renewing the house order. Could you say, I don't want any more lobbyists in the house?\n Because that disturbs our work or something.\n So lobbyists, I know that's always a hot topic, but we are being consulted by many experts.\n Of course, in that sense, they are all lobbyists.\n So I'll say, from the German Federal Trade Union, and Welfare to individual companies that operate in the house.\n To exclude that would block the house.\n But it's important that these things are transparent.\n That you know who is talking to whom.\n And we started to make it clear with the clear which organizations are moving in the house.\n Are you satisfied with that?\n No, not quite yet. I think we have put it in motion. It was important that transparency comes in first.\n We will get information from many outside and we will adjust and check it again and again."

We have taken the case as an example that we want to create transparency in, I have almost 200 police officers and I would just be against a partial judgment.\n They are all somehow right-wing extremists.\n You said it earlier, but there were...\n No, no, but there was also great concern with the deputies. Are we still safe in the house?\n And we have after that, that was before my time, but we now have again and again, when we get hints, there is something that we make sensitive.\n I also want to have an open culture, so when I get hints, everyone can rely on us to follow them.\n That we, even if it is possible, also follow them who it was from the day game, was it Taz or something?\n Yes, or Taz was it. The indications, there were also some disciplinary procedures.\n So in that respect I also want an open culture, because it is of no use to me to keep things secret and then run them under control afterwards.\n And we also come into a security problem afterwards.\n In that respect it is important to me that even if I get indications from information, that everyone can be sure that we will follow it.\n You are the successor of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, for example. He was the last president of the Bundestag. Do you do anything different?\n I think we are already a different generation. I don't think you can compare that.\n But did you bring in a different style? You are the head of 3,000 people in your administration. Do you manage it differently?\n Yes, I was just at the staff meeting this morning. We want to change something in the house. We see that in the digitalization we really need a lot of attention in the German Bundestag.\n Are there faxes?\n We're gradually finally getting rid of them.\n There are faxes, right? Yes, I think one or the other is throwing himself over his fax device and doesn't want to give it away.\n But that's really the plan, that we get rid of fax devices, that we digitize processes.\n The Global Register alone is a good example where we have finally managed to get it.\n Forms that can be filled out directly on the internet. We had a procedure with the members so that the transparency of the members\n that you really fill out a form of 30 pages, then print it out and scan it again and send it by email.\n This is not digitization as I imagine it.\n And that means we have now also sorted out a bit in the house.\n I have signed the Charter of Diversity because diversity is also important to me as a modern employer.\n It is no longer the case that we immediately get good employment for all positions.\n It is no longer enough for many people to say, oh, I work for the German Bundestag, but we also have to compete with other employers on the labor market.\n And that's why I also care about things like that."

I got through well.\n Is it still like that today?\n That you first look at what it's about before the audition?\n No, in the end it's not enough if you only look at it briefly before the end.\n No, but I have a certain ambition, no question, but I'm not that over-ambitious.\n And in that respect I always learned what was necessary.\n And that's how I got through it well. But I also liked going to school.\n Do you remember what the ambitious young B\u00e4rbel wanted to become?\n Certainly not the president of the Bundestag.\n No, I wanted to become a technical draftsman. That was my first wish.\n What was that?\n Well, back then it was still like that. Today I'm glad I didn't become one.\n It's a lot with computers, but I found this thing with circles, linears, drawing, drawing circles. I wanted to be a technical artist.\n Why did you want that?\n I found it fascinating with the circle, linears, triangle, geo triangle.\n What inspired you? I'm not so creative that I would want to become an artist, but it had to be straight.\n In the end, you drew a rough sketch and you could see a little bit.\n That somehow inspired me.\n Why didn't you want to do it?\n Because it belonged to the technical professions.\n I was a woman, or a girl, I wrote a lot of applications and the statement was always like this, no sanitary facilities for women.\n Seriously?\n Seriously. That was the way it was back then. Back then I would say I was really old, but I'm not the youngest anymore.\n When was that? In the 80s?\n In the 80s. If you didn't want to have a girl in the business sector, there was a good reason say that. We would like to do that, but unfortunately we don't have a ladies' toilet.\n And maybe you're saying that you only applied to NRW? Maybe you had to look elsewhere?\n In the GDR, women were allowed to do that.\n Yes, I know. It was probably a thing from the West, I don't know.\n But I didn't apply to the federal government. I was already in my district, Duisburg and the surrounding area.\n Or in North Rhine-Westphalia, I didn't dare to go out.\n Did you always want to stay at home?\n Yes. I admire the young people who say today they are doing a year abroad. I think I would never have dared to do that back then.\n I also saw that you went to a primary school from 17 to 84. Why not a gymnasium? I would think so. You know, the president of the federal parliament will probably have studied there,\n he will have a professor or a doctorate, and so on.\n No, my brother, who was three years before me,\n he was, as they say, expelled today, he didn't make it to the gymnasium.\n And then it was clear, then they won't make it either.\n So my parents were now also like that, that they said,\n if the teachers recommend that they should better not to the gym, they didn't rebel.\n Back then there was this decision about the school and then I went to the primary school.\n But you were so ambitious.\n Yes.\n You didn't want to go to the gym.\n With confidence.\n Didn't you tell your parents that you can do it?\n Yes, but it didn't help.\n I went to the primary school. Didn't you tell your parents that you can do it? Yes, but it didn't help.\n I went to the primary school.

That's not the case with the private one.\n How do you get insured as a member of parliament?\n You can actually choose where you are before. If you come to the Bundestag again, you can choose whether you want to be privately insured or legally insured.\n Because we are talking about two-class medicine, what do you think of private hospitals as a social democracy? Do we have that in Germany? Probably also in NRW where you come from? I think it was developed by privatization in the health sector.\n In the end it depends on whether I am well taken care of.\n My problem is simply that if there is a differentiation afterwards, who is better taken care of.\n I also want to say that private insurers are not always better taken care of,\n because they sometimes get research methods that are calculated, which are not necessary, sometimes too much.\n So it's not always healthier, depending on how you are insured.\n I think we have done a lot wrong in the hospital sector.\n You can see that in retrospect, I think, through privatization, the case bills.\n A lot has also been saved in the care, and that is now right, because we simply have too little care personnel,\n because it was included in the case-assets at the time.\n Then the staff in the care sector was saved, because you earned more money with certain operating keys.\n I know that Karl Lauterbach is now also working on another hospital reform."

This decision was made in response to the uncertainty of the situation and was subject to parliamentary withdrawal of authority at any time. The parliament had the clause included in the decision. Later, as the situation stabilized, the Bundestag gradually took back the competence to regulate health matters from the minister. This was not widely reported in the public, but the parliament held frequent debates and discussions on the laws and decisions related to the pandemic. The impression that the government and countries held all the power in regulating health matters was not entirely accurate, as the Bundestag played a significant role in shaping the regulations through its legislative function.",

But the good thing is, the truth is that we can change a lot in parliamentary proceedings.\n And that is often underestimated.\n The first draft, when you see a development, which we want to make possible digitally,\n that you can see what has actually changed from the first draft to the signing has actually changed.

No violence in parliament.\n No, order means that we actually have order possibilities in the session management.\n So I can call for order, I can give an order call.\n Like in Great Britain, like order?\n Something like that. We have to do that in the session management.\n Or I can put up to 1000 euros in order money and the hardest part is to exclude someone from a meeting.\n Because excluding a member of parliament, from practicing his mandate, that's the highest punishment.\n Assuming I'm a member of parliament, what would I have to do to exclude myself?\n I don't want to give any tips.\n Someone could see that and say, I'll try that next time.\n If I really insult you, we know what a serious insult is, can you exclude me for a month?\n Theoretically or practically it is so, it is not a cascade of orders that I have to give an order call first.\n Depending on the severity, I can immediately say 1000 euros or depending on the severity, I can immediately say get out of the hall.\n Have you done that before?\n No, I threatened it once.\n Why didn't you do that?\n When posters were held up.\n Are they all so nice?\n Yes, they immediately took the things down, immediately listened to me.\n Even the AfD listens to you?\n Yes.\n But did you ever wish for it or don't you enjoy it internally when you get 1000 euros at some point?\n Yes, maybe I'll do that, let's see.\n How long, so let's say I'm a bad deputy.\n I insulted you, you want to exclude me now.\n Can you exclude me for the entire legislature period?\n No, I don't think so. No, because then it will be attacked before court.\n Because it is already the case that it is of course the freedom of the mandate.\n So you have to be a little careful.\n I can't take my right from a deputy permanently for the rest of the legislature to no longer run his office.\n I think that's also very difficult by the constitution.\n But I can exclude him from the meeting week or depending on the situation from the next one, but not for the rest of the legislature.\n I think that would be too far. I would I would also lose if he goes to court with it. Speaking of freedom of the members of parliament, we know that there is a factual obligation to the faction or faction discipline, as you call it.\n Why? Why do you let that happen to you? I think it's also true that we're not all experts in all topics. I want to say that openly.\n What we should read and feel about everything is that we should be experts in all topics.\n That just doesn't work.\n Everyone has their own report, that's what we call it.\n Every deputy has his own subject.\n And in a large faction or even in a faction, you rely on your colleagues for the judgement.

The last one was a new record.\n 53 million euros were earned by MPs compared to 2009 when it was first discovered.\n And most of the side-exemptions come from the Union and FDP.

In the news, 4 out of 5 people in Germany say that our democracy is at risk.\n How do you explain that 80% of Germans think that democracy is at risk?\n How should I explain that?\n First of all, I think it it worrying that this feeling is there.\n I still believe, there have been surveys that say that democracy itself is still the best form of state.\n However, many are struggling with the institutions, also with the German Bundestag.\n I believe that this is also a alienation of the institution with the citizens or how decisions are made.\n Decisions are made.\n That's why I've tried to say, at least, let's have an element of the civil council to fill a gap again.\n And to install this element of civil participation at the German Bundestag.\n That's not a cure-all. And of course we have, through citizens of the Reich and rats and so on,\n we have anti-Semitism in Jewish communities, which sometimes takes place on schools.\n So it is a tendency to see that society is worried that democracy is at risk,\n that right-wing extremism is growing.\n It is not unfounded, but we can all do something about it,\n by showing civil courage, by becoming loud.\n I don't think politics alone can do that.\n That is also a task of society,\n if we want to keep our democratic, free system that way.\n You have now introduced one of the civil hearings.\n It was accidentally put together.\n In the end, a civil report is issued. What is the difference between the fact that we write it off and say thank you and it's nice that you were there?\n The advantage is that we have not asked the issue in black or white, for example, should there be a social obligation?\n Yes or no. We didn't do that because then it would polarize and above all we already know that\n parties say we don't want that. Then we would have asked the citizens, but we know exactly\n that it doesn't happen. We have very broadly covered this topic of food in the change.\n And I assume that there are many proposals and the difference is that this time we will discuss the proposals in the plenum.\n You will be able to understand which parts of it are included in the laws and you have to explain why you don't take over other parts,\n although it is a proposal of the citizen, because you may want to go a different way.\n But I think this openness to say we have debated your proposals and we have included some of them in the laws.\n We didn't include the other part because we want to go different ways.\n I think it's important to deal with it and not to put it in the drawer.\n You said it's nice that you wrote it. The president is accepting the report. That would be too little.\n But can't you imagine a further development of our democracy? We were at the subject of sovereignty and that you represent it.\n That we then also anchor civil councils, so that they also decide things without you saying yes or no. to surprise everyone by saying, what kind of instrument is that, it's a threat to democracy.

Instead, she suggests that parliament's task is to weigh down all arguments of all citizens and bring together opposite positions in parliamentary democracy. She acknowledges that the topic of climate protection and sustainability is important and requires consistent action, but emphasizes the need to consider the opinions and concerns of all citizens in the decision-making process. She also mentions that they are currently discussing a building energy law and want to address climate-damaging areas, indicating that they are not staying where they are. She has seen the effects of climate change firsthand and believes that expanding renewable energy is necessary to address the issue.

From Peking?\n Yes.\n Why?\n Because I live there.\n Why do you live there?\n Because it's exciting.\n Why is it exciting to live in Peking?\n Because this region changes very, very quickly and very strongly. And to observe that is very interesting.\n Why did you move there?\n It was a coincidence. I actually traveled there and stayed there. There was no big plan behind it.\n How old were you?\n 27.\n Oh.\n Yes.\n Did you just want to go on vacation?\n Yes, I went stay a little longer.\n What was so interesting about 1994 in Peking? So that Frank thinks, I'll stay.\n It was a society in its infancy and you could feel that in every corner. And that you can do a lot of things, that you can design.\n In football, you would say, play in the open space. And that was 1994. So you could feel that at every corner and at every end of this city.\n That you can build something there, that you can develop something.\n Now you say shock Tiananmen, what does that mean?\n Oh, that was the overthrow of the protest movement in 1989. And the square is called Tiananmen Square.\n Why was that a shock? For whom? For the system?\n For all people, of course. That was clear.\n It was a... I don't know why you have to ask the question that it's a shock, because it's actually a matter of course.\n People were shot down by tanks and that was of course a shock for the country.\n Why did people get up then?\n Originally it was an economic crisis with 30% inflation in 1988.\n And then the students sat on top and demanded more freedom, more\n demanded play space. Which you didn't get? Which you didn't get, at least not\n as you wanted. Has there been something like that since then? No. Why?\n That has to do with economic reasons, that there was never a big economic crisis afterwards.\n And the majority of people feel that their personal freedom is constantly increasing.\n And that's why there was no pressure in the bowl. At the end of last year, only a few days, when the protesters held up these white cards.\n But that was only a very small movement, if not in several cities.\n But otherwise, people are busy earning money, making sure that their children have a better education, to travel, to develop their personal freedoms.\n Was that also a movement for more co-determination.\n But it wasn't a constitutional movement for democracy in the narrow sense.\n You didn't wish to have our leader elected?\n That didn't play a central role. It was more about the question of more determination. It remained more vague.\n Basically, you wanted to determine more where it would go.\n Can young Chinese people learn something about the student movement from back then, if they wanted to?\n So could they read something about it in Chinese media or in the internet?\n Not in the censored media, but they could of course download a VPN channel, like many hundred million people do.\n And then they have access to all international media, also in Chinese language.\n That works.\n Do you also do research?\n Yes, sure.\n Is that difficult?\n No. Why?\n It's just a program, you press on and everything is fine.\n I think the least VPR users use it all the time, but we don't need it, do we?\n Exactly.\n Okay. You were 27, you stayed with your family?\n No, back then...\n You mean you went with your girlfriend?\n Yes, but that wasn't family yet. That was my girlfriend and family came much later. So children.\n Now you're almost 30 years old.\n Yes, exactly.\n Do you speak all Chinese fluently? No. My children laugh at me.\n I just got stuck at some point, so to speak.\n If you don't sit down every night and learn for three hours, you won't get any further at some point.\n And I prefer to drink a glass of wine in the evening.\n Do you speak Mandarin?\n Yes, most people speak Mandarin. There are basically only two major languages.\n That is Cantonese, which is spoken in the south, but the main language is Mandarin."

The protests were led by students and citizens demanding more democracy, freedom, and co-determination in response to an economic crisis and growing political discontent. The Chinese government responded with force, resulting in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians.\nSince then, the Chinese society has evolved in terms of economic conditions and personal freedoms. The economic crisis that preceded the protests never fully materialized, and the Chinese economy experienced rapid growth. The majority of the population has focused on earning money, ensuring their children receive a better education, and developing their personal freedoms. The internet and VPNs have provided access to international media, allowing Chinese citizens to learn about historical events like the Tiananmen Square protests.\nHowever, the Chinese government continues to heavily censor information related to the protests and maintains a tight grip on political power. While personal freedoms have increased, there has been no movement towards constitutional democracy or free and fair elections. The Chinese government has also implemented strict surveillance and control measures to maintain social stability.\nTherefore, while the Chinese society has undergone significant economic",

So I never know what comes out, even though it's a book.\n I never know what will come out when I start the book.\n That would be too boring for me.\n Do your books also come out in China?\n Yes, a little thinner.\n Why?\n Because they are censored.\n Why do you let that happen?\n You can say that if they are not censored... I find that interesting because you have a censored version that appears in Taiwan and a censored version and then you can see what was censored.\n That's very interesting.\n Can you think beforehand what is censored?\n I'm always surprised. Things that I would say are censored are not censored and things that I thought were not censored are censored.\n Give me an example.

Is there a censoring agency for foreign media?\n Yes, for books, for movies. There are people who sit there and read through it, watch the movies and then decide what goes in there or not.\n Have you ever censored yourself?\n No.\n I'd rather not keep that for myself, so that I don't get annoyed.\n No, because you can actually formulate everything in a way that the point of criticism still comes,\n without immediately giving one out of twelve.\n Have you ever gotten one to twelve?\n I have."

And that's not possible anymore, because they become more and more self-confident,\n more and more powerful and say, no, we have a different idea.\n That's not possible anymore or can we still try it?\n It seems to be so far-fetched sometimes.\n Well, we try it, but it doesn't work anymore.\n So to speak, if the West, now again such a\n partialization, but if the West speaks of the international world order,\n then the Asians, not only the Chinese, speak of it, yes, but that's not our\n world order, that's yours.

Or you have a lot of people.\n But Europe is still one of the largest markets in the world, economically speaking.\n Well, but it gets more difficult. As you just saw. These are dramatic developments. Especially when you see that the inflation in Asia is much, much lower. In China it is 2.5%. The\n national economies in this region are much more stable than in the West.\n But I mean, the table, if you now go from the United Nations, China is already sitting on it.\n Yes, but that's not the table that the rising countries say, that's the table we want, but that's the table of the West.\n With veto rights.\n China also has veto rights. No, but the Chinese also say that's not what we want. They want the world parliament to give power but also on the basis of the population.\n Because if we think about our value at the end, one man one vote, then Europe is about the same as the FDP in Germany.\n So there is nothing going on there alone.\n But we in Europe and in the USA, we do vote for our leaders.\n In China 1.4 billion cannot be chosen.\n Exactly. But in India and in Brazil and in Indonesia.\n And in South Africa, to name the largest country on the African continent.\n And in Kenya and so on. And these are all countries that belong to the outcasts. And it is interesting that the feeling is stronger to belong to outcasts or to the established than to democracies or to dictatorships.\n The feeling is stronger. That's why the countries don't join together according to political systems as we would actually like that.\n All democracies in the world join together against dictatorships,\n but this feeling of rising up is stronger.\n And with the established, the feeling of belonging to the established is stronger,\n i.e. to those who know where it goes.

The relationship between Russia and China is much more complicated because there is a competition within the socialist brother countries, who is more successful.\n Russia is not socialist? Russia was much more developed than China. After the war Stalin had Mao wait in Moscow for three weeks until he had received him.\n Mao noticed that.\n How did Mao was in Moscow?\n He asked for help.

He let him graze and in the moment when Mao had the feeling that he could do it alone, he said first of all, you can lay down your heads.\n And then there was a kind of hostile relationship.\n And then at some point in the 80s, people got together and it became a kind of purposeful marriage.\n That you say you have a long border with each other, 4200 kilometers, and it doesn't help.\n It's better when you get along with each other than if you don't get along with each other.\n And it was particularly difficult in the early 90s when the Chinese, then from the economic power, overtook the Russians.\n And today, in the past, the Russians looked down on the Chinese, today the Chinese look down on the Russians, so they can't get it cooked.

Because we say\n actually the Chinese have to separate from Russia. Russia was evil or is\n evil and the Chinese say no, we have to deal with them, they are our neighbors, we have a huge border and we don't want to, we can't even create climate change.\n Now, from the perspective of China, if we don't get the gas from Russia, we won't get down from the coal.\n And so you have to weigh one disadvantage against the other and basically sometimes you have the choice between plague and cholera.\n But do the Chinese understand the western view, especially the moral outrage about this war of this moral outrage, one loses sight of the other says we have to win.\n And they say that actually both positions are somewhat irrational.\n And why don't you go and say okay we build pressure with weapons and negotiate at the same time.

However, the economic disparity between the two countries has led to a complicated relationship, with Russia having about 2.8% of the world economy and China having 18%. Despite this, China has tried to maintain the relationship and not separate from Russia, even during the Ukraine war. The Chinese perspective is that they cannot afford to lose Russian gas and must weigh the disadvantages of not receiving it against the potential consequences of separating from Russia.

It only refers partly to Russia. China demands the return of the mentality of the Cold War.\n No country should pursue its own security at the expense of another country. The security of a region should not be reached by the strengthening and expansion of military blocks.

If the majority is for it, then it is. But it won, it's a big movement of rising behind it and it leads to a relative decline.\n That's the way it is. The USA won't disappear tomorrow, as you can see from the British Empire, but the power will be relativized and Europe won't be able to find its own role.\n Actually Europe should say now, dear Americans and Chinese, we have our own interests, we have our own ideas and we make our own politics. That would make sense if you want a multipolar world order, because otherwise you have a bipolar one.\n Exactly, we don't want that.

And that wasn't always bad, but it was also kind. These times were weakened by the Americans, who came here and there.\n They didn't explain the countries to America like the Brits, but only exchanged the governments.\n But this epoch, where we force the others to do what we think is right, this era is now coming to an end.\n That means we have to convince.

No, we should make offers that are better.

We want to exploit the African resources. The Americans want that.

They always do commercial, economic projects. They help of course by giving valuable loans, by sending companies over who wouldn't have gone over because it's too risky for them economically.\n But in the end there's always profit and loss.

While Europe has historically provided development aid in the form of grants and loans, the Chinese focus on commercial and economic projects. The Chinese do not view development aid as a useful tool, instead preferring to provide loans for infrastructure and commercial projects. These loans often come with the condition that Chinese companies are contracted to build and manage the projects, ensuring a return on investment for China.\n\nThe concept of long-term loans plays a crucial role in this comparison. Unlike European loans, which are often forgiven or restarted after a certain period, Chinese loans remain on the books. This creates a different psychological starting point for both parties. Additionally, the Chinese model allows for the possibility of extending loan repayment deadlines if necessary, providing a degree of flexibility that is not typically found in European development aid.\n\nAnother factor that distinguishes the Chinese approach is the role of state-owned enterprises. In Africa, Chinese state-owned enterprises are often contracted to build and manage infrastructure projects, ensuring a close relationship between the Chinese government and the African state.

Other perspectives.\n And those were also Germans.\n That was even more astonishing.\n They look at the world differently.\n It wasn't about ideology.\n It was really about the perspective.\n And about the own world of life.\n And I found that very interesting. Because before I had only taught in the West, there is only one view.\n We still wonder today, 30 years later, I mean, especially in Ukraine, they say, look at the Aussies, they are supposedly Putin-friendly. We just have a different perspective. We have a different perspective. We just experienced different things.\n And that was a key experience for me. That helped me a lot later in China.\n How?\n Well, when it came to understanding that people have different perspectives.\n I wasn't taught that in West German school.\n That's crazy. not taught. Crazy actually. Yes, but that was\n we fight them down, then everything falls apart\n and then they\n end the story\n and win. Exactly, then they\n put themselves in the\n success course\n and are very happy.\n And that was\n really, that was for me\n a very exciting experience and then I wanted to know, I, Brie, the philosophy people.\n And then I spoke to several people from the former leadership.\n And I got stuck with one person, G\u00fcnter Schabowski.\n And I wrote a book with him.\n And that was very, very exciting. I learned a lot.\n What?\n Well, how to sort of, how to adjust to the world on the one hand and how to actually live in another world.\n So he lived in another world within the GDR. That was, so to speak, another level, a more complex level. And fortunately he never said ...\n As a leadership cadre.\n Yes. He fortunately never said, I always had doubts, but I was so weak and so on.\n No, he said, I thought in December 89, we're going to exchange a little staff now and then it goes on. And he did that very thoroughly and we had conversations for months and a book was created from it.\n And I learned a lot about this topic.\n Are the Chinese interested in the collapse of the GDR? Yes, of course. Especially when it comes to how we can learn how not to do it. Gorbachev is considered as someone who did everything wrong. He gave up his country for nothing and nothing again.\n In our view he is a hero? Yes. The Chinese say he would have to open up gradually and sell himself more expensively.\n There is something to it.

They had incredible privileges.\n It was called, we are socialistic here.\n Well, the privileges were incredible, but they were privileges.\n They had a lot more.\n They had cans of beer and reindeers in the forest.\n They had their own lake.\n Yes, exactly. Is that the same in China?\n Of course they have privileges.\n The party officials?\n They live in a kind of Kreml in the city center, Zhongnanhai.\n So the top leadership.\n Of course they also have privileges, but you have to say,\n because it is a market economy, unlike the Soviet Union or the GDR, there are of course a lot more rich people than in Russia.\n Where they actually only became really rich after the collapse of the Soviet Union, where the people who were state-owned companies have been under the nail.\n In this respect...\n But as a common Chinese, do I have to be careful who I get to know?\n Not that it's someone from the party or from the leadership circle and then I get annoyed?\n No.\n No?\n No, no. No. The party members have to be careful that they are not too corrupt. There were strong campaigns where everyone had to sign how much real estate they had and how much they had to sign how much real estate he had and how much and then also so to speak, had to sign against it.

Farmers grow crops such as rice and corn, while nomads in the northern regions have a few goats or live in the desert edge area with a few animals. \nThe Chinese government has addressed the economic disparity between the coastal and western provinces through measures such as wage increases and relocation of industries. For instance, in the progressive province of Guangdong, the state allowed private companies to increase wages by 15% to make production too expensive and encourage companies to move to the western provinces where it is cheaper. This redistribution of resources and industries has helped to alleviate some of the economic disparity between the regions. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards vegetarianism and veganism in China, which is being promoted by the state as a way to reduce the consumption of meat and address the environmental impact of livestock farming.

The government is also promoting traditional vegetarian dishes and encouraging the development of modern vegetarian and vegan products based on these traditions. The movement towards vegetarian and vegan food is also being driven by cultural shifts and increasing awareness of animal welfare and health benefits. However, meat remains a status symbol in China, and the government recognizes the challenges of transitioning away from coal power and reducing meat consumption in such a large country.

We replace old coal power plants with new ones.\n And now there is a geopolitical development.

That was one reason why the coal miners said, climate change is good and nice, but we also have to preserve a preserve independence. That means we have to build up production capacities, coal-fired plants, even if we don't burn coal, to pay for the power supply in case we don't get anything.\n Build coal in China? Yes, of course.

China's solar panels and wind turbines are sold at affordable prices to the rest of the world, making renewable energy more accessible to other countries.

One reason was a sense of overconfidence and complacency, as China believed it was the non plus ultra both morally and technologically. This led to a lack of foresight and failure to prepare for the challenges posed by the industrial revolution.\nAnother reason was the interference of foreign powers, who colonized parts of China and forced the Chinese to trade primarily through their ports. This led to a reliance on exports of raw materials and imports of finished goods, which hindered the development of a domestic industrial sector.\nForeign powers, including Germany and the UK, established colonies in China and built infrastructure such as railways and breweries. China was late to industrialize and stopped early due to the economic and social instability caused by foreign interference and the resulting weakened economy.\nThe colonial powers also forced the Chinese to smoke opium, which led to addiction and further economic instability.

The movement gained momentum and eventually attracted the support of the Empress Dowager Cixi, who saw it as an opportunity to regain power after being sidelined by the Guangxu Emperor.\nThe Boxers were successful in weakening the Qing Dynasty's control over its territories and causing significant damage to foreign interests.

India belonged to the British.\n As I said, 100 years ago the British Empire ruled a quarter of the world.\n How did the war with Taiwan start? Can you explain that briefly?\n Basically, from these many warlords and these battles, crystallized into two big groups. On the one hand, it was the communists and on the other hand, the nationalists.\n And in the end, the communists, also because they had the communists came faster to the weapons of the retreating Japanese.\n They had to capitulate to Hiroshima.

There was a president named Nixon.\n He had big problems with the interior policy and he had an assistant and advisor, namely...\n Now I have a hang-up.\n Kissinger?\n Yes, of course. Henry Kissinger. And they thought about how to get out of the situation and they thought, well, through a big foreign policy chess move we distract from our internal political problems and we connect with the Chinese against the Soviet Union.

And that was an incredible achievement for Mao and for China. The Americans, Nixon and Kissinger, had completely different interests and didn't even think about economic dimensions at the beginning.\n And then it was the Chinese's gift to say that they don't have diplomatic relations with Taiwan anymore, but they have diplomatic relations with China. That was the big step.\n The Americans told the Taiwanese, friends, don't worry, we'll hold our hands over you militarily,\n but diplomatic relations we have now with the great China, that will do more.\n And that's where the one China principle came about. And that led to the fact that practically the whole world, except a handful of countries, basically only recognizes the People's Republic of China and not Taiwan.\n That's the situation we have nowadays.

            "reference_answer": "\nThe recognition of the People's Republic of China (PRC) by the United States and the establishment of the \"One China Principle\" can be traced back to the Second World War and the subsequent power struggles between the Nationalists and the Communists in China. The Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s and 1940s weakened the Chinese government, allowing the Communists to gain strength and eventually take control of the mainland in 1949. The Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to Taiwan and declared it an independent state.\nThe PRC and the Nationalist-controlled Taiwan both claimed to be the legitimate government of China. The United States initially recognized the Nationalist government, but as the Cold War began and the United States sought to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union's rival, China, the situation changed. In the late 1960s, U.S. President Richard Nixon and his advisor Henry Kissinger saw an opportunity to improve U.S.-China relations and distract from domestic political problems by establishing diplomatic ties with China.

            "reference_answer": "\nThe negotiations between China and the Vatican regarding the role of Christianity in China have been ongoing for several years, with the Vatican seeking to establish diplomatic relations and clarify the status of the Catholic Church in China. This issue is closely linked to Taiwan's status as an independent state, as China claims Taiwan as a part of its territory and insists that it is not an independent state.\n\nHistorically, Taiwan was not recognized as an independent state by the international community, and many countries, including the Vatican, maintained diplomatic relations with China. The Vatican's position on Taiwan's status was influenced by its desire to maintain good relations with China and ensure the freedom of religious practice for Catholics in the country.\n\nThe issue of Taiwan's status is also related to the strategic importance of the region. The USA has protected Taiwan's democratic government due to its geopolitical significance as a bulwark against Chinese expansionism and the risk of a third world war. China, on the other hand, sees Taiwan as a weak point and a potential threat, both politically and militarily.\n\nThe historical background of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule in 199",

There is the thesis that Chinese are always pragmatic and that communism was just a label to keep the country together.\n Did communism have a history in China?

No, Mao's successor was Deng Xiaoping.\n He even tried to overthrow Mao several times.\n Mao didn't succeed.\n And when Mao died in 1976, he took over Deng Xiaoping.\n Okay.\n I thought there might have been a successor in between, like in the Soviets.\n No, no, no. There was the 4-band band, but it didn't last long.\n It was a very short interplay.\n Deng Xiaoping was on the radar relatively quickly. So in 1976 he died and in 1979 he basically announced the new course of opening.\n Did he tell the Chinese, hey guys, a little less communism now, a little more capitalism?\n No, he said we can't do it alone. We are too weak. We have to get help from the foreigners. We have to learn from them. We have to learn from the foreigners. We have to learn from them.\n We have to learn from the capitalists.\n Yes.

The market economy plays a decisive role.\n We're talking about a capitalist market economy. Profit striving.\n The Chinese government is also clear that innovation is only possible in a market competition,\n that the state cannot invent it.\n At the same time, however, there are strict rules of play. And that's what you could call communist. Actually the term doesn't fit.\n The Germans would say ordo-liberal. Ordinance policy, legal conditions. That is the basic principle.

I think that in the end communism is a label that you don't say goodbye to, a slogan that creates a certain continuity. The West is also always blaming China for being the evil communists, Frank.\n We don't get confused, that's not a communist.\n So if communism is a party rule, then China is still a communist.\n That's true. We can talk about dictatorship, we can talk about that later.

Maybe we have to limit the time of co-determination.\n Maybe there has to be a point from which\n there is no longer discussion, but then it is implemented.\n Sometimes I think about it in Germany,\n conservative rights, even exploiting these co-determinations\n that we have, for example with things they don't want.\n Renewable and so on.\n There they have suddenly promoted a lot of co-determination,\n so that the angry citizens have the next wind. Maybe it would be a progress of co-determination, so that the angry citizens somehow have the next wind.\n Maybe it would be a progress of our democracies that one says for a certain period of time everyone and as many and as intensively as they want to talk with,\n but then there is a point of no return and then a decision is made and if it was wrong, then you can still elect the government, but you can't raise a claim, start a process again, and start a citizen initiative again.\n And with the Chinese it is certainly the case that you say you have to make it more open, you have to make it more transparent, you have to doing everything wrong.\n But that wasn't the case. And in fact they also questioned the most progressive cartel lawyers and that has been included in their legislation. Do you have to ask the Chinese what they think about Robert Habeck or the German government\n for example, abolishing Tenet or there are some other energy...\n No, the Chinese would say about the energy...\n We act communistic, you had to ask that. Exactly. So energy is state in China. Banks are mostly state.\n What about media? is mostly state-controlled. And that is of course,\n they work with that, carefully put, in a different way.\n How?\n Rather in a So the media in China are basically gathers\n with which the sheep are driven in a certain direction.\n And not, so. And not open forums of discussion.\n At this point we probably can't learn that much.\n But can the Chinese discuss openly somewhere?\n Are there end-to-end encrypted chat programs or something like that?\n They constantly invent synonyms for everything.\n And it always takes until the sensors come behind it.\n And then it's too late and they invented the next synonym.\n So that's a very heated discussion.\n And you shouldn't forget the areas where there is a very open critical debate.\n So I have the example of food security, medical care, pollution.\n There is a real environmental movement. There are areas where there is a lot of open and controversial discussion.\n But for example the topic of how to vote and how many parties are there and if the president is allowed to lift the constitution and now have a third term.\n These are taboos in the big platforms.\n In a restaurant, at the table, there is no one at all.

The government believes that there should be a point of no return where decisions are made and implemented, despite the potential for errors, which can be addressed through elections. The interview also touches upon the limitations of open public debate in China, with media being mostly state-controlled and discussions on certain topics, such as voting systems and constitutional changes, being taboo in major platforms.

First of all, is China a dictatorship?\n That's the question how to define dictatorship. If one party is a dictatorship, then China is a dictatorship.\n For me the GDR was a dictatorship where only the SED was ruling.\n Yes. Do the Chinese know that they live in a dictatorship? Because the background of my question is, I often talked to people who have lived in the GDR for a long time, who then tell me, in principle I only understood that it was a dictatorship when it was over.\n So they weren't even aware of it. Well, that's the same in China. It's of course...\n Do you know that they live in an unfree state?\n That's another question. Do you feel that you are in a dictatorship to be unfree? I wouldn't answer yes right away.\n Because you can travel? No, also because they have a completely different standard of living.\n The standard of living has improved in an unimaginable way.\n Of most people.\n If you had asked them in the 90s, do you think it is possible that you have this or that standard of living.\n Then she would have said, that's unimaginable.\n In this respect, they certainly feel a freedom, an increasing freedom.\n This freedom comes with increasing play, to be able to decide for oneself, to have the economic foundations, to be able to decide.\n If it's about voting now, then\u2026\n A political freedom, exactly.\n A political freedom, then there is, so to speak, then they would feel rather, or some would feel rather, unfree.\n But do you know that you live in a dictatorship?

They simply weigh advantages and disadvantages soberly and say that I now live in this system has great advantages but also great disadvantages.\n And I would say the system exists as long as the balance, so if I weigh disadvantages and advantages, as long as the advantages are superior. Very simple.\n In the moment when the majority of the Chinese population has the feeling that the system in which they live has more disadvantages, they are immediately on the street.\n And no state security and no surveillance technology, even if it is developed in this way, can prevent it.\n And that's why the Communist Party is striving.

Can you look into the future? Can you plan for 10, 20 years in such a political system?\n These are topics that they emphasize to secure their own power.\n But don't they wonder why German-Americans always exchange their government?\n Well, not with us in the last 60 years, but you know what I mean.\n Do you have to explain to them why we vote? Do you have friends who you say, listen up?\n They're not stupid.\n They're not stupid?\n No.\n They also learn at school that there are elections and stuff.\n Yes, and they go at it in detail.\n So that's the difference. They look at the pros and cons pretty soberly.\n And we don't do that. We say good and bad. Right and wrong, good and bad. And that could be a disadvantage for us in the long run,\n because it reduces our ability to develop strategies adapted to reality.\n And in this respect, the Chinese are more open.

Of course he tried that.\n But you can't get him out of any power constellation.\n And then you have to say, okay, some can't get through one, others can't get through the other.\n What do we do now?\n Well, let's take Xi Jinping.\n It was a compromise between the heterogeneous groups.\n And then you underestimated the man and then he consolidated his power very, very quickly.\n For example, he started an anti-corruption campaign and actually fought corruption, but also used this campaign to get rid of politically unfriendly figures. that he succeeded in getting a constitutional change.\n Before that, after two years of office they had to leave.\n How long was one term?\n Five years. So after ten years they had to leave.\n And I always found that to be a big strength of this dictatorship,\n that they said, after ten years we'll exchange staff.\n They would have been further away than us.\n Yes.\n At least with the Americans it's the same.

One\n says I've actually been there for 12 years and he makes pretty big accusations, especially this one one says\n actually you are completely uncritical and actually more a Chinese than an independent German journalist\n and you would feel softly what actually is going dictatorship in China. I noticed when you said that you said several times that in a country as big as China,\n it simply doesn't work, for example, energy transition or immediate transition to renewable energies.\n And then came a nation that spends 600 billion US dollars on armaments and has a moon travel program.\n It can also make energy changes and teach the citizens to read.\n Is this a typical confrontation among Germans living in China?\n I don't find the arguments convincing at first, because they are making the energy transition.\n They are world champions in solar energy, in wind energy.\n I think they just can't do more.\n It's just not physically possible.\n You need engineers for this and so on and so forth. Then I also said\n quite clearly what I don't like about this system. Quite clear and clear. We\n talked about Xinjiang. In this respect, I don't find the argument of softening the skin is that convincing, to be honest.\n But of course there is always the debate to say, how bad is China actually?\n Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. And my argument is that we have to learn to see both at the same time.\n We have to endure it in this ambivalence.\n That there are at the same time incredible advantages and strengths\n and on the other hand very large, unacceptable human rights violations\n that we have to talk about.\n And everyone who tells that it's just one thing or the other,\n I'm careful about that. We have also got used to such ambivalence in the USA.\n We have the very liberal San Francisco, on the other hand we have the Bible Belt and the\n weapons lobby. We have the Silicon Valley and the Rednecks, we have Trump and California or the liberal east coast.\n And China is similar.\n It's with such a perspective that says, people, let's take a closer look and not binary black and white,\n but look at what is with them, even if they are completely different from us, what about those, where we have to say, isn't that something for us too?"

Frank responded by acknowledging the existence of human rights violations in China but also emphasizing the importance of recognizing the ambivalence and learning to see both the advantages and disadvantages of China. He also defended his reporting by highlighting China's achievements in renewable energy and education. Frank did not find the arguments of the accuser convincing, especially the argument that China can make energy changes and teach citizens to read despite spending 600 billion US dollars on armaments and having a moon travel program.

Because they are the stronger ones.\n There is a nice sentence,\n the clever one will follow.\n The result is that the ignorant one will prevail.\n I wouldn't sign that.\n I would always\n focus on the weaknesses.\n On the things I criticize.\n But\n maybe not about sanctions,\n but about through dialogue.\n But I would never cut them out.\n And I don't think that you can neutralize human rights violations through successes on the other hand.\n But both are there, that's part of the ambivalence.\n That you perceive both and not that one overcomes the other.\n So you can't say that so many people have never been brought out of poverty like in the development in China.\n That's why it doesn't matter what happens in Tibet or Xinjiang.\n That can't be. Question was, how do the citizens of China look at the distribution of wealth in their own country or worldwide?\n Well, you can see that the distribution of wealth is not an extreme amount of inequality. However, one has to say that it is not about the farmer in the hinterland asking to live like the person in Shanghai.\n But it is about being involved in this process of rising continuously and substantially.\n I think that is the crucial political answer.\n But you said earlier yourself that there is enormous wealth, also through the private, basically capitalist, entrepreneurs.\n There are the princelings, the number that lower the average age of Porsche owners. That is also a split or a gap in wealth and wealth development in the country.\n Is that a topic of discussion in China?\n Of course.\n Yes?\n Yes, of course.\n The gap between rich and poor is getting bigger and bigger.\n Yes.\n That's unfortunately the case.\n That's because the rich are getting richer faster\n and the others are not get there as fast.\n That's the crucial political topic.\n Also in China.\n Yes, of course. How do I make sure that no one falls through?\n If you read through politicians' speeches, then that's a crucial point, this making up. This is why these campaigns to help the West, the rural regions, to help the farmers to come with us and that not only the industrialization of the coastal countries is going well.\n And I think that is also a very important requirement for the stability. Another question.\n The Chinese view on North Korea\n and its dictator Kim Jong-un\n is to some extent\n harmful to the Chinese regime.\n Yes, of course.\n The basic\n constellation is Yes, of course. The basic thing is that the Russians and the Chinese don't want North Korea to collapse because then the Americans are right on the border.\n So Kim can do what he wants, he is always somehow fed.\n Because he is needed. He knows that of course and that's why he is so strict and that's what annoys him of course.\n When he fires a rocket again, from which you don't know if he got it or not, but you don't know for sure if he can steer it and where it will land.\n And he says then, hello I'm still there and I need a little support again. This is a power constellation, which is as it is.\n And as long as the Americans are in South Korea, nothing will change.\n He is the buffer that is needed.\n Yes, he is the buffer that is needed.

You have a number of public appearances here in Germany now.\n No, I can't do that.\n No, I can't do that.\n Have you ever had problems with the censorship you described earlier, where you were sometimes surprised? There are former ARD and ZDF correspondents who said that when we were sent or written unloved or critical reports, we were already felt big advantage, that's why I'm untypical. I've been there for so long and I know the people for so long.\n That means that my playing space or my status as a farm breeder is a little bigger than my colleagues who have only been there for four years. years are there.

That's just the way it is.\n Is it true that less and less Chinese passes are issued and thus less\n can travel? So it was at least in the high phase of Covid.\n Yes, but I don't think that will stay that way permanently. I don't assume that.\n But is it over? Yes, it's over.\n We already had that, environmental protection. How can you imagine the power or the independence of the provincial governors\n against the state president Xi Jinping?\n If the numbers are right, they have a lot of room.\n What does that mean exactly?\n If the economic numbers are right, if the province is prospering they would have plenty of room.\n Big jump. How do you estimate the situation in general in the Indo-Pacific?\n As far as the new world order is concerned, India, Japan, Australia and Asia. Does that fit with the Chinese,\n one can say, increasing demand for leadership?\n Yes, because one has decided to have\n their own interests on the one hand,\n also so to speak hegemonic interests in the\n South Chinese Sea with the occupation of these islands.\n On the other hand, one is interested in running in the group at Sea with the occupation of these islands.

However, Schabowski missed the note specifying this deadline during the hectic press conference.

This led to a wave of excitement among the East German population, who began rushing to the border crossings to take advantage of the new freedom to travel to the West. Schabowski was initially surprised by the unexpected outcome of his announcement, as he had assumed that people would go to the police stations to get the necessary stamps before leaving.

                "5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n So, a new episode of Jung Naiv. We are in the studio and I have a new guest. Who are you?\n Lars Feld.\n What are you doing, Lars?\n I am a professor of business policy at the University of Freiburg, director of the Walter Eucken Institute.\n And I am and have been active in various advisory functions, last in the Board of Directors for Economy.\n That the General Assembly is called the Board of Directors for Economy. You were even the head now.\n I was even the chairman last year\n of my ten-year membership.\n Is it always like that, that you are the head last year?\n No, the chairman is elected by the members of the Board of Directors\n and they elected me last year.\n But there are only five members, so there is a five-rounder, right?\n Yes, there is a five-rounder.\n The law has also determined that the members of their committee elect a chairman or a chairman.\n How did you convince them?\n Oh, I was for a long time ...\n Did you still have a election campaign?\n No, I didn't need to.\n I was in it for a long time and was responsible for the finance policy, which always means that if you know what is happening in the finance policy, that the European political issues, the social political issues, they all have a place in it.\n That means I did a lot of the core business of the board of directors and then the members also decided for me.\n Is the economic way actually the Olymp for the German economists? Or as a German economist?\n If you got there, did you make it?\n You can't say that. You have to clearly notice that in my field, in the economics, there is a strong research orientation. It has always existed, but it has become increasingly important with the internationalisation of the last 20-30 years,\n so that the actual Olympus is the Nobel Prize and not the economic need? On the one hand, there are councils in Europe in different countries that have been founded\n partly according to the role model of the board of directors, for example in Denmark. In\n France it is different, this board is also exchanged with each government change.\n In smaller countries this did not happen, but with the provision, I think it is from the\n six-pack regulation,\n to introduce a so-called fiscal council to monitor financial policy,\n some countries took the opportunity and then founded a board with a broader mandate,\n similar to the council of secretaries. So for example Spain did that.\n But does it need something like that?\n Could there be such a council for the European economy with a German, a Spaniard, an Italian in Greece?\n That could be possible and we also have a European fiscal council that has specifically assessed the financial policy of the member states at the EU is a strange structure. It is not a federal state, it has a statehood not in the narrow sense.\n It is a construct between federal state and state federation. The Federal Constitutional Court always says state federation to somehow understand that.\n And therefore it is of course a bit more difficult. Whether such a board needs it, I find it useful. But that's no wonder, I was a member. But still, if you made your report, it didn't necessarily have an impact.\n So theoretically, all governments could always say, Lars, thanks for your advice, but we choose to ignore it.\n Yes, basically every government can say that, but they can't completely ignore it. It is also stated in the law that in the annual economic report, which will come three or four months later,\n actually January 2.5, the federal government must take reference to the annual report of the board of directors, in whatever form.\n In any case, this means that employees in the ministries responsible for economic policy at least have to have read parts of the report.\n But to whom do you always hand it over? To Merkel or to Altmaier?\n No, to the chancellor.\n She doesn't read it, does she?\n I don't think so.\n Why is it handed over?\n Well, because it's a press conference and an act that always takes place.\n But is it a deception of the public?\n No.\n The chancellor doesn't read it.\n The chancellor doesn't read it, but her employees read it, have lunch with the Chancellor and the cabinet,\n to then discuss the annual report with some distance and peace\n and to discuss the upcoming challenges in the spring for the year that is then in progress."

The Board of Directors for Economy is a five-member committee that advises the German government on economic matters. The chairman is elected by the members of the board.\n\nThe annual report of the board is an essential document that assesses the financial policy of the German government and provides recommendations for the upcoming year. The report is presented to the German Chancellor in a formal press conference, even though it is not read by the Chancellor herself. Instead, her employees read the report and discuss its contents with her and the cabinet during their regular meetings. This process allows for a thorough analysis of the report's findings and the development of strategies to address the economic challenges of the year.",

The BMAS is responsible for the largest part of the federal budget and is responsible for the labour market and the important social policies.\n You have to keep that in mind. These are essential parts of the economic policy, which are not usually included in the Ministry of Economy, if you don't have a super ministry.\n Maybe the division is not that bad. The Ministry of Labor takes over the interests of the workers,\n the Ministry of Finance, the interests of the employers.\n Altmaier said on Friday,\n I represent the interests of the economy.\n Well, the interests of the economy,\n I always try to differentiate and say,\n I'm concerned with the entire economy,\n not the employers or the employers.\n Or are they special interest groups?\n I've always tried,\n well, the economy of the people is an old-fashioned name,\n in the past it was called national economy, it is also a strange name,\n and that's why you say better economy, if you say it in German,\n but it's about the whole German economy and European economy.\n So now you're no longer an economist, what's the Nobel Prize for?\n It doesn't really exist, right? It's just called that. If you take it more precisely, it's a prize from the Swedish Nationalbank, the Swedish Riksbank, that's what it's called.\n But it's so well-known that it's now accepted as a Nobel Prize.\n What does it look like? Do you have any chances?\n No, I've gone very decisively towards economic policy, then you simply don't have the time to do research to the extent\n and also to do basic research, that you would have a chance at the Nobel Prize.\n Then you have to see on the other side, without a background at an American university,\n it is very difficult to get the Nobel Prize."

And that has led to unemployment, especially in the lower wage area,\n and has led to the fact that the unemployed with low qualifications hardly ever got into jobs.\n And that is, in my opinion, the wrong way. But where was the Angle F 2010, to be specific,\n not radical enough? Where would you say we would have done more consistently?\n I would have done more with the labour market regulation. We have, in view of\n various elements of the prohibition of protection, received opening legislation,\n if you think of lay-off work, temporary work, for example, there were facilitations and the like.\n But it was only minor things. In essence, the German prohibition of protection of rights is still relatively restrictive and we can be happy,\n unlike Italy, for example, that our workability decides these cases\n quickly and the employers know quickly what they are.\n Did you wish for a stronger Hire and Fire mentality?\n I wouldn't say that.\n That the employers can fire their employees faster and set them up?\n Hire and Fire is the American system.\n What I have foreseen are the Flex Security models\n as we have them in Switzerland and Denmark.\n Also two very different systems if you look at it from a social and political point of view.\n There you have a very flexible working situation and therefore a higher insurance for those who become unemployed.\n What would that mean if that had happened in Germany? Give us an example.\n Basically, you would have to get as insurance would be higher for unemployed people.\n So not 67% or 60%, if you are unmarried, of the last salary you earned and the last salary, but higher have become more expensive and on the other hand, there is a clear flexibility in the contractual regulations. In Switzerland, you typically have a term of termination of three or six months.\n Have you ever been terminated?\n No, never. I have never been terminated. I have always had small jobs during my studies, but as a student you are always only employed as a minor and retirement is not really an issue.\n And on the other hand, if you are then employed in public service at some point, you are not threatened by retirement.\n Have you never been unemployed?\n No, never.\n Do you have to be that to know the situation of unemployed people or is that not a factor in economic science? I think it is generally not a factor that you have to have been in a situation to\n analyze these situations or these framework conditions and\n find out what is reasonable or not. That would be even nicer if everyone had\n everything through first in order to make sensible decisions afterwards.\n That applies to politics as well.\n Yes, there is always the accusation that he hasn't worked a day, that he has been sitting in his seat since he was in the Bundestag.\n I think that's wrong. I always like to oppose those who always raise their voices against the economy.\n You should think a little more carefully about what the principle of working division means.\n Someone who is a professional politician and is able to get to the top has certain advantages to do politics compared to others.\n Tell me, how did you grow up? What did your parents do?\n My father was a credit officer at a bank in Saarbr\u00fccken. No, that was the former R\u00f6chling Bank, which was then taken over by the Bavarian Association Bank and then by the Hypo Association Bank, which is now at Unicredit."

The most important innovation\n of the last year is the development of drugs, i.e. a vaccine that has been developed.\n And that also on a gene-based basis. And we have not been friendly to\n gene technology in the last decades.\n I am just wondering which innovations private clinics have produced in Germany in recent years.\n It is certainly a process innovation that must be taken into account.\n And what we now also have in the health sector, that in the course of digitization and automation,\n for example, it is discussed for which treatments you can use, for example, operation robots.\n But if private clinics are in the health system, then there is a profit thinking.\n They want to make money. Can you make money with it on sick people and the health system?\n Sure.\n But we could say as a society that we don't want that.\n You could also say that it's not good.\n The market should stand out.\n There should be no market.\n You shouldn't make a profit with health care.\n That's too much for me.\n So the question of profit is not the key point.\n Because we ultimately want a good supply to come about. And when we look at the purely state systems, we always have certain forms of rationing that we have always rejected in Germany.\n So, for example, which operations are carried out beyond the age of 80.\n We have that in the British NHS, for example.\n Not in the Swedish.\n We don't have it in the Swedish.\n Not in the Dutch either.\n The Dutch system is different.\n There is always this state system, it is always called Great Britain, but Sweden forgets it.\n No, I don't forget it.\n There are good state health systems and not so good."

And then it comes\n down to the restrictions. The orientation to want to get as much profit as possible. Yes,\n I don't want to tell everyone that they are\n maximizers of profit, but you drive better if you do that.\n But you do that in companies, right?\n I think it's better to tell everyone that they are maximizers of profit.\n But now we're talking about big companies. Helios and Co.\n Yes, it doesn't matter if you take big companies or small companies or private\n people. You are, if you try to set rules for an economic system\n or in general rules for a state and a society,\n on the safe side, if you assume that people\n would act the way you fear they would act,\n then you have robust rules.\n If you have to trust it...\n So, expect the worst and hope for the best.\n Yes.\n Yes.\n You don't have to hope for the best, but you can try to set the rules and the framework so that you get a relatively good result.\n Then the question is, if the private clinics in Germany still make billions of euros, are the rules not strict enough?\n They could maybe make 100,000 euros, for my sake.\n Or a million, but if they make billions...\n But Thilo, the question of the amount of profit is not relevant for that.\n But the money has to be somewhere...\n They have to have earned it somewhere.\n Yes.\n So if billions are missing in the health care system and that is being spent on the shareholders...\n Then there is obviously a willingness to pay for it. The question is always, if we have such a system, is it actually also the willingness to pay\n for the people who can express themselves in a reasonable way?\n Or is there market power or something like that that can lead to exploitation of the crime?\n So a system in which we would exploit the state organization of the health care system is bad.\n But we have already briefly discussed it.\n I then look at the health care system and ask where the inefficiencies are."

            "reference_answer": "\nLars Feld believes that profit should not be the primary focus in healthcare financing, as the ultimate goal is to ensure a good supply of healthcare services. He acknowledges that there are good and bad state healthcare systems, and that some elements of private provision may be desirable in Germany. However, he emphasizes the need for strict regulations on private clinics to prevent profit maximization from negatively impacting the health system. He suggests that the rules should be designed assuming that people will act in the way that could potentially harm the system, to ensure robustness. Feld also raises concerns about the potential for market power and exploitation in a healthcare system that is heavily influenced by private providers. He suggests that the question is whether the willingness to pay for healthcare services in such a system comes from the people who can reasonably express their needs, or if it is driven by market power or exploitation. Overall, Feld advocates for a healthcare financing system that balances the need for efficiency with the importance of ensuring equitable access to healthcare services.",

You were one yourself.\n Yes, I was just a nurse.\n You can feel more into it than I can.\n I can feel into it, yes.\n And my wife is a doctor who has worked in clinics for a long time in Germany and Switzerland.\n Exploitation is too far for me.\n I wouldn't say that. We have exploitation in other contexts, but not there.\n Is there exploitation in Germany?\n Well, if I look at what there is about black work, illegal employment, there is also exploitation in a large scale, of course.\n I'm thinking of the foreign harvesters or people in meat factories and so on.\n The fact that you call them farmers shows that we have put a view from the outside and that many in agriculture cannot really afford to exploit them.\n The question of exploitation is always how you fix it. I always make exploitation based on the fact that people do something they wouldn't normally do if the employer didn't have the pressure. from mostly workers, rare workers, but also workers,\n from outside, because we don't have enough workers who do these hard jobs.\n And they are ready to do that.\n The hard workers get relatively a lot of money compared to what they would otherwise earn.\n Maybe you should just pay more money so that Germans think,\n okay, it was a hard job, but good money.\n This results in, so to speak, on its own. We have already seen last year how difficult it was\n to get the staff in the pandemic. But you can also see in the time frame before the pandemic,\n in the years of 1918, that it has become increasingly difficult to get a\n herder. In the meat industry, the problem is a little bit different.\n I know some companies in the meat industry that don't have the problems that T\u00f6nnies has.\n You just mentioned the insurance, the civil insurance. What do you think about it?\n What the SPD, the Greens, and probably the left-wing want?\n So to put it roughly, the abolishment of the dual system, private and legal.\n Yes, there are two different paths. On the one hand the financing side and on the other hand the question of whether we organize this privately or do we do it purely state-owned.\n We could also imagine private companies and you pay a certain amount at the level of your income.\n So not only interest rates, but also income.\n And that is the civil insurance, unlike the current financing of the legal health insurance.\n And the separation of state and private is in a way also a bit more differentiated to judge.\n You have to know that the far largest part of the private insurance is the civil servants.\n Maybe they should pay the same system as the majority.\n Yes, but it is a confusion between state and private, especially when it is state-employed in the private insurance.\n I have to say, I like the system, the Swiss one, much better. In the Swiss system you have private insurance, no legal insurance. You pay premiums, that is, rather head-to-head, as it to income differences in car insurance.\n And on the other hand, more than half, almost 60% of the Swiss population,\n receives subsidies from the general state household through so-called premiums.\n That means you don't have a purely private system,\n but the state pays relatively a lot to the insured themselves."

That fascinated me.\n Werner Pommerene is a student of Bruno Frey,\n although they weren't very much apart in terms of age. This was because\n Bruno became Professor and Constance very early, namely I think at the age of 27 or 28. And\n Bruno Frei founded the Freischule with many professors, just like that in the German-speaking\n room, some still in office and would today.

I found that fascinating. This combination of VWL and political science, the interface between political science and economics, I found very fascinating.\n And Werner Pommerene was just an extremely strong man in research. He worked day and night, had many risk factors for the heart attack he later got.\n Did you read Adam Smith, Keynes, Marx at the university?\n Only later.\n So I did a dogma-historical course at the end of my studies with Rudolf Richter.\n There we read Marx, Carl Menger, Smith, Ricardo, B\u00f6hm-Barberg and others, then a number of younger\n authors.\n I thought that was quite nice, but that I then read the\n The Wealth of Nations completely and later Theory of Moral Sentiments\n and so on, that actually came first in my doctoral studies.\n That was capital?\n Not completely, just parts of it.\n And?\n That didn't fascinate me.\n Did he have a right to do that? Or did he keep his right? Marx?\n That's a difficult question.\n He described capitalism at the time.\n Yes, but that's a difficult question. Because the question we always asked ourselves, or the one I asked myself early on,\n why didn't this Marxist prognosis of communism, this historical determinism that is in there, doesn't work.\n What was the reason for that?\n So the other question is, where did he get the injustice?\n Well, his way out was, okay, we have to get away from it.\n But he described capitalism in itself, and that seems to be still in line with the big picture today.\n What you draw from it and which keys he drew, you don't have to discuss that now.

So both the labor market policy and the money policy should only offer support.\n And that means, essentially, that the money policy is responsible for the state's budget restrictions,\n by printing money and ensuring that this budget restriction is not too strong. And this idea is exactly the same as that of MMT.\n But unlike MMT, Eberleurner did not claim that this was a theory of money,\n but he said right away that this was a financial theory.\n And in this respect, the first M is wrong, it is not modern, but old.\n The second M is wrong, it is not modern, but old.

It's not a science of the mind.\n I try to separate them.\n I like to count the lawyers in social sciences,\n although they sometimes defend themselves.\n But in any case, economics, sociology and politics are part of it.\n It's nice that you say that, because economists sometimes act as if what they say is the law of nature.\n No, no, that's not the case.\n So you have to see that the decisions that are made in societies,\n both for economic and social and political reasons,\n are made by individuals and not by particles.\n That's just a huge difference to the natural sciences.\n What directions did the professors have where you were? Were you shaped there? So there is\n then, at that time it was called so ordo-liberal, one of the socialists, how can you imagine that?\n Yes, I can't really say how politically they are to be identified.\n Someone like Olaf Sievert was pragmatic and a member of the Council of Representatives and then oriented towards economic policy.\n Probably more conservative.\n So close to the CDU.\n He later became head of the Central Bank in Saxony-Thuringia at the end of his career.\n But I can't say that he was a member of the CDU.\n Does the CDU name him ordo-liberal?\n Not necessarily.

The focus of functional finance was on ensuring that the money policy supports the state's budget restrictions by printing money and preventing the budget restriction from being too stringent. This idea is similar to that of MMT, but Eberleurner did not claim it to be a monetary theory. Instead, he considered it a financial policy. The theoretical foundation of functional finance was to prioritize full employment and have other political areas stand back to offer support. This approach is different from MMT in that it does not claim to be a modern or monetary theory but rather an old financial policy. Additionally, functional finance did not have a significant theoretical foundation compared to MMT, which has been the subject of extensive research and debate in modern economics.",

I would not want to accept that contractual freedom is driven so far that companies can form a cartel, can make agreements.\n For example, especially competition policy is an essential element of the ordoliberal.

There are not that many worldwide.\n Oligopolies means when four or five companies dominate the market.\n When few. We'll say few.

In the energy sector, we have only, there is a lot of state provision for the electricity and power economy.\n How do we get rid of an oligopoly?\n The question is always how harmful it actually is with an oligopoly.\n The oligopoly can, as I mentioned, if there is an oligopolistic competition, very likely to be very intensive among a few providers.\n So if they don't let themselves be at ease.\n Can, can.\n Yes, that means of course that I have to be an oligopolist.\n The state must ensure that it must be so.\n Exactly. That means you have to go from the state side oligopolist\n check again and again whether there are agreements or not.\n And if there is an agreement, then you have to punish accordingly.\n Is it smarter for an oligopolist to talk to the other oligopolists or not?\n Well, I'm here as a public servant who looks at the whole thing in a comprehensive way and have the impression that the profits that can be achieved through the agreements in the oligopoly\n cannot be rewarded for the harsh penalties that are then imposed on the EU level.\n So we are now at such high penalties that it is already serious.\n What advantages does oligopoly have for a society and what disadvantages? The advantage is that you can achieve scale advantages with large companies in certain industries.\n That means the costs are distributed to a larger production.\n That is an advantage for the companies. That's an advantage, but it's also an advantage for the customers, for the consumers,\n if this advantage is passed on to them.\n And for that, the competition between these companies must be there.\n In this respect, an oligopoly is not bad per se,\n but it has to be regulated accordingly.\n But that splits into a advantage and a disadvantage.\n If they pass it on to you, it's an advantage, if not, it's a disadvantage.\n Normally, the competition ensures that we have a price increase.\n Unless they cancel it.\n Unless they cancel it.

Can you as a state simply ensure that there is no monopoly?\n So by making preventive laws or regulations, that you say, okay, a company shouldn't just get bigger or something.\n I think you can't do that that way.\n So to say that's the right size, that's not possible to determine. You can also use other that's the right size.\n You can also use other factors besides size.\n I think you have to try to decide procedurally.\n What I just mentioned, the creation of national champions,\n this goal setting in the system of a political system,\n is wrong in my opinion. You shouldn't do that.\n You won't get into the problem of you have a monopolist afterwards with whom you somehow have to deal with.\n Are they European champions?\n It's exactly the same. So especially then, European champions means that they would have a market-dominant position in Europe,\n not only in Germany, but throughout Europe and then carry that on to the outside.\n Of course, we have talked about Google and how to deal with them.\n The EU is now important for that has 100,000 employees and\n at 101st we will beat it or so. Defeating is not provided in our competition law anyway\n . So that means we have a whole range of\n possibilities to proceed in competition law. Defeating is not provided?\n No. The difference is in American competition law, where the\n defeat has been put in again. Yes, that's put back in. There is a long discussion about it.\n Oh dear, do you want to start with me now?\n Only if you want to.\n If it is understandable for the layman.\n Exactly, that's the problem, to explain it later, whether it makes sense or not.\n Okay, you are against national champions, against European champions.\n What do we do in your logic if the Americans have national champions, the Chinese have national champions?\n Yes, we as a market are so important that these providers want to offer us. If they don't do it, we don't have a problem.\n Then we can offer our European providers.\n Yes, because then the American and Chinese champions are making themselves available to us.\n Yes, if they can make themselves available. We can also try to go against these champions with our European competition policy.\n And that's exactly what we're doing nowadays.\n So if you look at the latest novella in the GWB, the law on competition restrictions,\n there are a whole series of regulations that aim at such platform companies,\n and in general platform companies and not just Google,\n to go around in such a way that they have to reduce their market-dominant orders and can no longer proceed to that extent.\n Is it actually in the constitution that there should be no monopoly or something?\n I'm not a lawyer, but not in my knowledge.\n Our economic system is not even fixed in the constitution.\n Exactly, that's the point. And that's not bad either.\n Why?\n That's right, in my opinion. There was the discussion whether one should write down social market economy as an economic system.\n No, we have a whole series of foundations that ultimately determine the system of market economy on the one hand and the social policy,\n that is, the social state aspect. And that's enough for us. We don't need to define the economic system separately.\n So the property guarantee, for example, in the Basic Law.\n Freedom of expression and other freedoms are fixed, which are essential, fundamental for market economy.\n And on the other hand, we have the social state guarantee, which then determines this adjective social market economy.\n So that's why we don't need all of that.\n It's basically in there indirectly.\n True.\n I just came up with the idea that our constitutional protection agencies interpret it differently sometimes.\n I mean, there will be end zones that are deliberately anti-capitalist\n already classified as an observation case because they are anti-capitalist.\n But that's not a state hazard.\n Yes, I mean, what the constitutional protection does, I'm not a specialist for that, I like to hold back.\n It also has a monopoly.\n I'm different with the constitutional courts, but with the constitutional protection, yes, that's of course the case.\n Can you shut them down?

You know that I'm a big advocate of the debt break and I think it should stay that way.\n So that was the only and last thing that was included in the constitution?\n I don't know if that's the last thing, but it should be in the constitution, in my opinion.\n I think a fiscal rule in our German system develops a binding effect if we have it legally secured. Otherwise probably not.\n And that's why our fiscal rules have always been in the constitution, even if you go to the time before the founding of the Federal Republic, so the Weimar Republic because of me. We have always had constitutional rules,\n always had fiscal rules on the constitutional level,\n because in the 19th century we had a wide range of lawsuits in the multilateral system.\n Then you started with fiscal rules, because these lawsuits came up then.\n And yes, accordingly, I think it's right to define that as constitutional.\n But the nice thing is that you always have to ask yourself in such constitutions,\n how open are they for new social developments in the future,\n which we then have to secure by law.\n I don't see that at the moment, which may also have to do with the fact that I'm not a lawyer.\n But I think we should keep this open and make sure that we will also make the changes in the constitution in the future.\n We change the constitution more often, especially when it comes to the interplay of states, countries and municipalities.\n You can be critical of the changes in the past years at many points.\n But that's not something I would be on to demand a change in the constitution.\n But now an important election is in place. It could happen that a political constitution will come out that will throw the debt brake out of the constitution.\n Do you know who to turn to?\n Yes, I will write against it every day if it has to be.\n Explain for the tenants what the debt break mean? The debt break means that the decisions for taxes, other deductions and expenses then have to be made by the decision-makers today and all those who are affected by them also have decision-making power.\n You have to explain it differently.\n The debt break ensures that the distribution conflicts that the public household always keeps ready have to be resolved today\n and not only in the future, but also by future generations.\n Because if at some point the situation should arise\n that the financial policy is running out of control,\n then the future generations will suffer especially.\n I would have wished that Greece had had a debt break in the 1980s.\n Then we wouldn't have had the collapse of the Greek economy.\n And it was especially the younger people who were affected, not the older ones.\n But don't you think that future generations will be grateful to us,\n if we now, nowadays,\n put hundreds of billions,\n if not even billions of euros into climate protection,\n so that these future generations have a life value?\n Yes, I am firmly convinced of that.\n So climate protection is, in my opinion is one of the most important...\n I can't imagine that my grandchildren would say at some point,\n it's good that you have kept the debt break rule at that time."

You have to talk about it, because just putting money there doesn't help at all if we don't reduce CO2.\n So just to say that we in Germany now have a climate-neutral economy, the rest of the world doesn't care, that helps the future generation zero.\n But I wanted to stay with the debt brake itself. Debt brake means income, expenses basically the same.\n And with the climate we could say, okay, we're doing a lot of expenses because of the future generation.\n You could also say, let's raise the income.\n Then the tax break is stopped again.\n Yes, I think so.\n We have a lack of capital, taxes and I don't know.\n If you think we need these massive expenses for climate protection, then you have to finance them through taxes.\n That's the position I'm representing.\n Although you have to say again, the debt brake is a bit more complex.\n It's not like we don't make debts today.\n Last year and this year we had record debt rates.\n There is a limit, a percentage limit.\n There is a normal limit, a rule limit for normal debt in normal times.\n And what is possible in debt is fluctuating around this rule.\n In boom times you have to build surplus, in worse times, recessions and heavy crises you make decent deficits.\n That is very Keynesian thought, to be honest.\n But we are in a heavy climate crisis, we have to make a lot of deficits. We are not yet in the climate crisis. I think we would only get in if we did not reach the 2-degree goal.\n Or maybe the other half-time goal.\n Then it's too late. Then it's too late.\n Then we have the crisis. That's exactly the point.\n The crisis only comes when the cart is in the dirt.\n The crisis we have now is the corona crisis.\n We are not yet in the climate crisis. We can still react.\n A debt crisis does not occur when you have low debts, but it occurs when you cannot pay your debts anymore.\n So if you have driven the cart into the dirt. And that's why you have to react beforehand. And you have to do that with climate protection as well.\n I thought we had the cart in the dirt for a long time and that's why the world is getting warmer. No, we can achieve much more with a decent CO2 allocation\n and we can also achieve international agreements much easier with a decent CO2 allocation.\n That climate protection policy must be operated in conjunction with this,\n for example by providing infrastructure that is necessary for other technologies,\n by seeing through research and development, we can see what we can achieve further.\n And for that we need additional expenses from the state.

For me, the coal exit is above all a regional political measure to provide more political peace in the regions.\n To dig up resources so that other things can be operated.\n We should have left them flat. Or should we have left them to the market?\n No, you can't leave anything to the market with an externality like climate problems.\n You have to make sure that CO2 emissions are not too high.\n But then it would be even worse for the coal companies.\n If they don't have any subsidies anymore, but have to pay CO2 prices, they are even more likely to leave the market.\n I think you can't even say that so easily.\n If I look at the steel industry, there are of course a number of companies that do their work by working with electricity as energy carriers.\n They don't have such a big problem.\n If the electricity comes from renewable energies,\n such a steel company can continue to work without further ado.\n Would be able to sell certificates.\n No, so you have to see again,\n and then we talk about CO2 prices,\n which go far beyond what we have now.\n We would have to talk about a size of 100 euros per ton of CO2.\n And that is the idea that is, in my opinion, the right one for a reasonable climate\n protection policy. You take money with it. So it's not like the debt\n break is preventing income from trading emission certificates on the state side.\n Is the debt break an audio-liiberalism set in the basic law?\n In a way, yes. If modern autoliberalism, modern order economy is understood as a rule orientation for the economic policy, it is a rule for the financial policy, yes.\n And needs more rules. So you don't have that in your head anymore. You couldn't say that earlier.\n Yes, yes.\n That something is missing in the constitution?\n No, I wanted to hold back on the question of what needs to be written into the constitution.\n Also because I'm not a lawyer.\n You can express your wish and then we let our lawyers...\n Wishes are something for Christmas.\n So not for the economy. I rarely express these wishes.\n I have certain ideas that aim at removing the problems we have.\n Then I can also present competing ideas.\n So that's not a matter of wishes. No, the point is rather that I would ask myself whether we might think about our political system at other points.\n I am from my research in the past and also currently a representative of a federalism that is competitively aligned,\n i.e. with clearer competence regulations on all levels, not such a mixed system as we have in Germany. And secondly, always someone who sees direct national rights, i.e. referendums and initiatives,\n as a possibility to complement the representative rulebook that we have.\n We'll talk about that later.

That means we don't have\n a loss of payments, Germany operates its loans and ...\n Yes, but in a major crisis there are always debt conferences and then debts are\n cut.\n Yes, the typical thing we have is that less developed countries or\n threshold countries have these debt conferences.\n Argentina is a notorious case that comes around again and again with a new restructuring.\n So that happens on the one hand, but the interesting thing is that it is also a remittance that takes place.\n And if you look again at what conditions this happens,\n often it is not worse for the believers if the debt is repaid.\n So you always have to look closely at what's happening there and to what extent debts are being paid in the sense that we actually have a haircut.\n Wouldn't it be possible to make a total global reset, to put all debts in all states to zero?\n Even if you wanted to have the mother of the financial crisis, it's possible.\n Why is that?

The point, and this is also completely clear in the economy, but in the economy it is also clear that the investments in the rule of law, if it works well, are also investments.\n And yet the salaries of the judges are all counted as consumer expenses with us.\n Why?\n On the other hand, we calculate, for example, the construction of children's money as an investment.\n If you go through this, you will always find out that if the state does something meaningful,\n you can see it as an investment in the future for our future generations, for ourselves, for this state.\n And then we can leave it out of the school break. No, because the point is that you can also do everything in the transfer area,\n everything that we do as a social insurance, if it is not exaggerated and is meaningful,\n also as an investment.\n Well, but then everything that the state does is investment and then you would have to say,\n then it has to owe 100% and not finance it over taxes.\n That can't work.\n But you say there is a saying that even for good debts there is a upper limit.\n I'm saying that there is a total upper limit for debts.\n We can't say which state expenses...\n So just by categorizing you can't say what good and bad expenses are.\n Well, yes.\n Expenses for climate protection against climate change?\n No, there are...\n I mean, you can say that we have an expense for climate protection and certain companies in the Ruhr area in the steel industry are paying their initial investment.\n Then I would say that these are not good expenses for climate protection. You can put that under the heading climate protection, but it's not good. I don't want to pay any subsidies.\n But you know that good investments can make good debts. And then and then you could say okay and those, there are no...\n But still, basically you have to say really clearly in which areas of the state what exactly to do.\n Even with the classic state investments, think of the traffic infrastructure.\n I don't want us to have eight-lane highways everywhere, pulled tightly through Germany.\n I don't think that's right.

He emphasizes that the financing side of state spending is through taxes or debts. \nRegarding investments in education, climate protection, and the rule of law, Lars Feld argues that they can be considered good debts if the state is addressing market failures, creating social and political balance, and ensuring macroeconomic stability. He suggests that investments in education, climate protection, and the rule of law can be seen as investments in the future for future generations. However, he also acknowledges that there is a limit to the total amount of debt a state can incur and not all state expenses can be classified as good or investments. For instance, he criticizes subsidies for certain industries, such as the steel industry, under the heading of climate protection, as not being good investments. Instead, he advocates for prioritizing investments in areas that are necessary and in line with climate protection goals.",

First of all, I went abroad\n in 1998 and got a promotion grant from the Swiss National Fund.\n I was in Los Angeles at the University of Southern California for half a year and then another half a year in the UK.\n Then I went back and finished my PhD, or rather I finished and passed the PhD at that time.\n I had my PhD in 1999 and became a full-time lecturer in St. Gallen for the postdoc phase. Today it's called assistant professor, which we know as junior professors in Germany.\n And I was able to apply until 2002.\n And lived that long in Switzerland.\n And what does tax reform in Switzerland mean?\n That the difference in burden with income and profit tax is enormous.\n So the cantons have the basic competence to tax income and profits.\n The municipalities raise such a contribution so that there can be a different burden between the municipalities and cities.\n The federal government also has its own direct federal tax on income and profits.\n And these are not calculated under each other.\n That means there is a cumulative burden.\n And that is very different.\n An example is when you live in Zurich, you pay about the city of Zurich and the canton of Zurich\n with an income, a taxable income,\n so all the deductions are gone, from one million Swiss francs a year to more than 25 percent income tax.\n And then comes the direct federal tax in the amount of 11. something percent.\n If you go to the Freienbach community in the canton of Schwitz, half an hour away, you pay about 8% income tax for the same income.\n Nice. Why aren't they all going there?\n Because the differences in tax burden in real estate prices and rents are decreasing.\n Yes.\n That's an important difference. And because on the other hand, Freienbach\u2026\n That's where 8% income tax is, the real estate prices are higher.\n We economists like to say that ceteris paribus is higher. So given what is offered there in the Freienbach community, they are higher.\n And in Freienbach there are probably many more millionaires and billionaires who can afford it. Exactly. We also know that in other cantons. I have now named the canton Schwitz and the community of Freienbach.\n In Schwitz, of course, you have other communities that are a little more attractive than Freienbach.\n Or we have the canton Zug, which is best known for this and has been driving this tax saving model for a long time.\n And of course it also plays a role in terms of infrastructure services.\n Some people prefer to live in Zurich, even if they have a higher tax burden, because Zurich is simply more attractive. It's nicer to live in Zurich than in Freienbach.\n Is there a country financial balance in Switzerland?\n There is a financial balance, it's not just a country financial balance.

It's always a system in our country.\n A canton financial balance.\n It's a system in which the federal government also plays a role. But there is also a balance, a horizontal financial balance between the cantons. Do you think it's right that there is a balance between countries in Germany?\n I think that's right, but I think it's too egalitarian.\n What does that mean?\n It's the case that the financial differences between all countries are too much.\n And that's why it happens that if, for example, the Saarland had an additional settlement and could realize higher tax revenues,\n that in the system of the financial balance that has been in force since last year, an over-leveling takes place. That means, so ...\n Please don't say too many foreign words.\n I try. So I'll explain again from the beginning.\n Let's say that Saarland has a new settlement and has a million additional tax revenues.\n And then the financial balance that has been valid since last year is taken away by over a million,\n because Saarland then gets less from the financial balance system.\n That means it's not worth making a new settlement at all.\n So over the million. That means we have in that sense ...\n For the society probably because there are jobs.\n Yes, there are jobs through it, that's right. But financially, that's\n uninteresting for the Saarland. And that's why there is always the risk that you are not\n documented enough.\n But financial policy is perhaps not always the most obvious criterion.\n But often.\n But should that in the end, the most important thing is not always the most obvious criterion. But often.\n But should it be like that?\n That it is such an important criterion. It is simply so. I don't know if it has to be the most important thing. But it is just an important criterion.\n I am quite pragmatic. It is just the way it is.\n But which criteria are even more important or more equal?\n I don't do any ...\n Social ... or even more important? I don't do any social work. Yes, thank you for the keyword.\n Workplaces are something that brings something to society.\n Yes, but workplaces only bring something if you think about it. So I mean,\n to create a workplace, because of me, also from the state side, if you\n dig up bottles and dig them out again, that doesn't help. I mean, we also have to have\n workplaces that create value, that give people a perspective, that's no good.

The appointment process involved Feld being asked in September if he was ready to join the board of directors, receiving a green light in December, and the news being made public in January. Feld has defended the market economic order and believes that climate protection can be achieved through market economic instruments such as a CO2 price. He is bound by the mandate of the board of trustees, which requires the development of economic policy based on the market economic order. Feld is a financial scientist and was appointed to the board of trustees due to his expertise in public finances.

We calculate what comes out of pension payments according to the pension formula. That means you have to have worked for a certain amount of time.\n It is also calculated according to the level of income you have achieved and the like.\n So that's why there is this complicated pension formula.\n So in that respect, the pension payments themselves are always limited and dependent on what you did before.\n On the other hand, the duration, the duration of the pension is not the goal size, but it is just an indication that we have spent more and more time in the retirement age in the many decades due to an expansion of the average have also favored for many years and which others also favor, is that. That's the idea. That means you would have to work longer, but only slowly, gradually over time and\n then still have at least on average a longer retirement period.\n And what you have to discuss there, which we also discussed in the last year's report,\n is the question of how this longer retirement period is distributed.\n There are also some who work in certain jobs and therefore also have a shorter retirement phase and\n don't have that much of it, those who are on average much much older are\n just those who have a different burden on their job during their working life and that is\n a difficult solution or a difficult question that years of work and 40 years of free time? That's too short for me.\n That's fair.\n No.\n Why?\n Well, because then those who work 40 years have to pay so incredibly much in taxes so that the others who are then still 40 years in retirement ...\n But that's a system of circulation.\n Yes, it's a great circulation system in which the younger ones are massively disadvantaged.\n Well, you can somehow regulate that.\n You could also think of a new system for the money that comes from the pension system.\n Where should it come from?"

Even included, of course.\n Do you save? Do you pay?\n I think I even signed a Riesda contract at the time. But that's very simple.\n So if it's private, say it.\n Also there is division of labor, the financial decisions at our home meet\n my wife much more than I do.\n Really?\n Yes.\n The economist gives the ...\n Yes, absolutely.\n What's going on there?\n My wife is much more economical and future-oriented than I am.

I used to like to celebrate, we just found out.\n Do you still like to celebrate?\n Yes, I mean, of course it's not as possible as it used to be.\n You're not the youngest anymore.\n Not in the pandemic, but ...\n Not in the pandemic either, but ...\n You have to invite me sometime.\n I'll do that, gladly.\n If you hang out with a party like you, then we have to do something.\n If a real party comes up again, yes.\n If you hang out like you, then we have to do it. If a real party rises again.\n But you also have an advantage as chairman of the business department.\n You are probably invited everywhere.\n With the lectures.\n Well, it depends.\n I mean, if you give a lecture and let it be granted, then the exchange relationship is clear.\n So you present, for example, a customer presentation for a bank, in which you discuss and describe the economic situation based on the year's budget and beyond.\n And in return there is a return. A very normal relationship.\n Where do you not take money?\n At political foundations I usually don't take money.\n If so, they only have small compensation of 500 euros or something.\n I don't take money from political parties when they invite me.\n I don't take money from student organizations, student congresses,\n from research seminars. I have also regularly presented the annual reports to universities.\n So my presentation is already very, very intensive and covers basically the entire range of schools, universities, service clubs like Rotary, Lions or Zonta,\n up to scientific lectures, which of course are not provided at scientific conferences.\n You actually pay a fee for the day and provided lectures at customer lectures.\n Good.

It does not help to bind work and capital into companies that no longer have a viable business model.\n I understand that the parties want to prevent a rapid increase in unemployment rates before the Bundestag election, but that is not an economic category for me.\n Why is the springy increase in unemployment not an economic category?\n What is not an economic category in this quote is the interest in the Bundestag election.\n In my opinion ...\n But it was understood that the increase in unemployment is not an economic category.\n That may be, but that's not what I thought.\n The election itself is not an economic category for me.\n It's a political category.\n And the question of extension, you always have to see in what context I made or do such statements.\n It was about the extension at the time and it was discussed with which additional conditions this extension should come.\n And it was important to me to point out that we have the problem with structural change, that you should not simply bind the workers in the companies that do not have chance of survival in the end. And what the politics then did, it did not simply take the extension as it was intended,\n but it made sure that from this second quarter on,\n you also have qualifications and that you have to prove them from July on,\n if you want to have a short-time worker's salary.\n And I felt that in view of my criticism as a reasonable compromise.\n And so we wrote that down in the annual report.\n But isn't it understandable that the political parties,\n which eventually level the politics,\n worry about the possibility of a high unemployment,\n if they impose the short-time employment?\n Well, the question is always what happens\n if we just let the short-time employment continue action? Well, the question is always what happens if we just let the short-time wage go on,\n whether the damage is not greater afterwards.\n We also had a phase in which the short-time wage did not work as well as after the financial crisis.\n Damage to the labor market, so for the employees.\n If they would not be fired?\n Well, look at the reunification.\n We have set up short-time wage, short-time wage zero, over a long period of time, relatively generously.\n It wasn't cheap. We should have stopped earlier with it. We should have stopped earlier with the other labour market policies so that people actually got jobs.\n And we actually only did that with the reforms of the Schr\u00f6der government, bringing people back into jobs. And that is the key point in the labor market. To keep them in short-time worker regulations or in employment measures,\n as the things used to be called, that doesn't help. That doesn't bring the employees anything\n and the employees who are in there don't either. And it doesn't bring\n the overall development of the economy. So you always have to see that it's not always about the short-term memories.\n We saw that in 2008 and 2009 the regulations of the short-term wage were favorable.\n That helped. We got through the crisis well.\n We then also cashed the generous decisions on the short-term wage\n and then it went very well in the labor market in the weeks, in the months and years after.\n But after the reunification it was not so cheap.\n But now the pandemic is something different than reunification.\n Absolutely, the pandemic is something different, but we still know, first of all, we did not know from the beginning how long the pandemic was going on.\n Secondly, we still do not know what effects the pandemic will have structurally.\n So will it be like this afterwards that we have fewer flights, so that the airfares are better occupied on the train?

The money that we take away from debts comes from the financial markets. Because the financial markets are the ones that refinance us.\n The money we take on debt comes from the capital markets.\n We are dependent on the financial markets.\n We are dependent on the moneymakers. Let's put it that way.\n Let's not say it so abstractly, but financial markets are an abstract construct.\n They are moneymakers.\n They are private companies.\n Banks, they are banks, they are private people who buy state loans, there are funds.\n Then we make ourselves very reprehensible as a state to these actors.\n Whenever you make debts, you make yourself reprehensible in a certain way.\n You have to be able to serve them.\n Or you think about making debts to someone else, that you organize it differently. Yes, but you always have to see what the market conditions are and who is\n lending money to you in good conditions. That is no problem for the federal government at the moment.\n He earns money with it when he makes debts. He even gets a negative interest.\n We are privileged as Germany.\n We are privileged as Germany. Others do not have this privilege,\n for example the United States does not, although they offer the world reserve currency.\n They have to deliver positive interest rates.\n So that depends on the conditions.\n And of course you can say I don't want the financial markets, then you go to a decent credit high, but usually requires higher interest rates.\n But why do we signal the financial markets when we take away the debt, that we don't have our demography under control?\n That we don't have the demographic problem under control? I don't even know if I have demography,\n did I authorize demography?\n My concern is indeed that the politics\n takes the pandemic as an excuse to eliminate the debt break.\n That would be completely wrong from my point of view.\n If you take away the debt break,\n you signalize the financial markets,\n we don't have the demography in our country under control.\n We make debts, we expropriate.\n So that's a mistake.\n It's not like we don't have the demography in control. We can't have it in control.\n It's running anyway. But the financial problems that arise from the demography.\n And in general we signal the financial market participants,\n whether the solidity of the past years still applies or whether you have to demand higher interest rates from Germany.\n I have another quote, again from the world, so there are obviously interviews from the world.\n You also said again about the topic of state-belief, the world has asked.

A transition solution. This must also be extended throughout the EU to these other sectors\n that are not yet covered in the EU.

What reforms are necessary?\n Market-economic reforms?\n Well, again, with the demographic, that's a different age. With climate protection, a sharper CO2 pricing and international agreements.\n With the issue of digitalization and technical progress, increasing Germany's innovation capacity.\n And innovation means the implementation of new ideas that we have in the field of research and development into marketable products.\n And we can see that Germany has problems.\n To found startups, to bring startups forward in the growth phase and to ensure that we have innovation.\n We are behind states like the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland.\n And a whole range of changes are necessary.\n If you look at how difficult it is to implement innovation and investment in Germany,\n both state and private,\n a narrow range of regulations that prevent investment for a long time\n or push it to the long run,\n then we don't have to address the problems of the Berlin airport.\n We can also talk about the expansion of rail traffic on the Rheinschiene,\n if it is about state investment.\n But we can also talk about the construction of the new stadium of SC Freiburg. Or we can talk about investments that were\n wanted to be carried out in the field of gene technology from BASF, but then\n have taken place in the USA, because we have restricted it.\n In terms of climate protection, the CO2 level is now only falling in terms of market economic\n Reform.

But isn't it, the school to which you would orientate yourself, if I understand this correctly,\n so autoliberalism in a modern form,\n doesn't build on the idea that it would make sense to make as few concrete regulations as possible for the actors of the economic process as few concrete guidelines as possible,\n but to let them act.\n That's a bit of an ideology, an idea of what is good and right in the running.\n So autoliberalism or orderly economics means to make economic policy rule-oriented.\n That does not mean with as few restrictions as possible,\n as you have now formulated, but that means with reasonable restrictions.\n So to ask, how do I have to set the framework conditions\n to get a good result?\n Eucken has formulated it nicely, it is about creating a human-worthy order.\n Yes, but exactly, human-worthy.\n And there are also a whole series of follow-up questions\n that refer to the fact that you said\n we don't have an ecological crisis,\n so no climate crisis,\n but we can handle all of this.\n We have instruments.\n They say, sorry,\n we have already had global warming.\n We are now fighting to reach the 1.5 degree target.\n Hardly anyone thinks that this is still to be achieved.\n We are in the middle of a crisis.\n What kind of crisis term do you have, is asked,\n if you call it a crisis only when the poop is steaming\n and the cart hangs on the wall.\n Yes, that is a crisis term.\n I think many would share it.\n So if we go back to medicine, for example,\n I just said that I was working as a caretaker in psychiatry,\n then we also take the crisis as a phenomenon\n that actually only occurs during the collapse.\n So then when the difficulty is there.\n And typically you try to heal in the next step and do something about it.\n Of course, this can be so serious crises as the climate crisis can become,\n can it be that we can no longer correct it.\n That means, as long as I still have the opportunity to preventively change something in advance\n so that it doesn't get worse and we don't have the collapse, then I think we are not yet in the crisis.\n But is the work, as you understand it, of the economist, also of the political economist, who you are, also controlled by the fact that he says we have to recognize crisis symptoms early on and see that we can preventively counter-control a time when the crisis is about to break out.\n Is that the task?\n Yes, we have to recognize in advance what is happening to do something about it,\n so that we do not get such a collapse of the systems.\n What does that mean?

            "reference_answer": "\nLars Feld, an economist and former chairman of the German Economic Association, views economics as a social science that deals with economic issues and their social implications. He acknowledges that economics has ideological elements, but emphasizes that these ideas and thought structures have become less important over time due to the scientific method's empirical examination. Feld identifies autoliberalism or orderly economics as an approach that aims to create a human-worthy order by setting reasonable framework conditions for economic actors. He clarifies that this does not mean making economic policy with as few restrictions as possible, but rather making it rule-oriented. Feld also acknowledges the existence of crises, but emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing them before they lead to a collapse of the systems. In the context of the current pandemic, Feld acknowledges that the economic implications of the pandemic are complex and that the benefits and damages of different policy responses, such as hard lockdowns, are difficult to evaluate.",

Three weeks of a hard lockdown and then we can open again compared to what we have had for a year.\n A bit of a lockdown. Where is the damage and the benefit greater?\n That's a more difficult question.\n On the one hand, I have tried to make it clear throughout this Corona pandemic that there is no simple simple goal conflict between economy and health.\n So you have to see very clearly that the health impacts that we have in the\n pandemic would lead to people staying at home even without lockdown, also losing a lot more\n trust and the economic activity would not go on. And we see\n this, for example, also in Sweden. We also see it in historical investigations of other pandemics in the past. So there is no such simple goal conflict.\n What is best done economically is a good anti-pandemic policy.\n So on the one hand to say we are trying to keep the infection rates as low as possible in the waves\n so that our health system does not collapse, i that the intensive care facilities are not overcrowded and that triage decisions are made.\n Because this was really asked, a certain time in the reopening,\n both medically, ethically and economically the right one.\n Yes, I have used myself for this, although you always have to ask again with which instruments.\n So unlike what we had last year, Clemens Fuest now also encouraged the no-covid strategy in this no-covid group, not the border closure.\n And that means, of course, that we could continue to maintain our internationalized value chains.\n That means that this would not belong to this no-covid strategy that we close the industry.\n So not zero covid, no covid is something else.\n Exactly.\n So you are for no-Covid. Absolutely. That means, of course, that I have also emphasized in the discussions, even in the past days, how important, in my opinion, a barrier of exit from higher incidences, i.e. for example an incidence of 100, is.\n And that it can be effective, which we have also seen in various contexts.\n So much that it is currently still empirically disputed. I believe that we would already be able to move forward with such a barrier.\n It was asked about minimum wage, destroy jobs, did not occur.\n Did this lead to a change in your way of thinking?\n No, so again, I have argued against the minimum wage and said that there is a danger that it will cost massive jobs in the interview.\n After that, in the annual report in which we rejected the minimum wage from the board of directors, a prognosis was included that we had made how much the minimum wage would cost in 2015. This is based on 100,000 employment conditions.\n And if you look at the studies that have been conducted today,\n you will find that about 100,000 employment conditions have been lost due to the minimum wage.\n But in view of the very good financial development, this did not play a role at all, because we\n have had so many additional employment conditions in other\n contexts. In this respect, I am always very clear about the prognosis\n and say that the prognosis we made back then was not\n wrong. What I focused on in the interview,\n is also in this rejection of the minimum wage in the annual report,\n if we get a politically driven minimum wage that is set higher and higher,\n and then also more and more working conditions are established that are then no longer profitable for the employer,\n then we also get higher unemployment.\n And that's exactly the problem that I don't want to have.\n At this point I remain critical.\n Today I am also critically critical of a minimum wage of 12 euros, from now to the same time."

I think that the minimum wage can be a market-based political instrument,\n especially in the case of regional market power by employers is corrected by the minimum wage.\n We have that again and again, especially in the service well.

Ultimately, the protection that the British and\n the Americans offer these tax oases is too great. An oasis like the Cayman Islands would not work without Great Britain.\n We can say the same at other places.

What do you say to the thesis that the forecasts regarding growing inflation, also due to growing debt from states, have always been wrong in the past? It's not correct to say that, because of course it would always mean that we are historically\n going back in time and that doesn't work. In the last 20 years.\n In the last ten years I would admit that this is the case. But that also has a lot to do with the fact that\n it has been underestimated how badly the banking system has come out of the financial and banking crisis. And there are also long-standing analyses that say, well, after a banking crisis,\n the systems are already very vulnerable and until we get to inflation, it takes quite a long time.\n So until the problems in the bank balance sheets are cleared, it takes a long time.\n We have had that in the Union of Stock Exchange.\n While the United States, which have cleaned quickly and more consistently cleaned up their banking system, both in management and in the balance sheets, have returned to higher inflation rates earlier.\n Which are still very modest.\n They are still at 2%, but of course that was also because the monetary policy has not become much more relaxed. That is now different. So both the monetary policy and the financial policy in the USA are now quite different.\n So that you should not be weighing yourself on the other side now, that the inflation phenomenon does not occur.\n The economic theory for which you represent is, I think, still connected with the claim to growth. There was the concrete question of how one can imagine economic growth,\n since we have an ecological limitation of resources on the other side.\n The limitation of resources is the actual phenomenon that economists deal with.\n It's about scarcity and the question of how to deal with scarcity.\n This is how an introduction to the teaching of economics begins, if it's done well.\n So it's nothing new at all that it's about limiting resources and the question of how to deal with it.\n One problem that we have to address in terms of growth is how does growth come about at all?\n Growth is much, much less resource consumption consumption than it was 20 years ago.\n Relatively.\n Relatively seen, of course.\n Absolutely, it's more.\n Relatively seen.\n And the resource, is the relationship actually the same?\n What we mainly achieve in growth is an improvement in the quality of our standard of living.\n And we see that as resource-saving.\n We just talked about it, Thilo and I. I come from the Saarland.\n That is an area that has been very strongly based on the motor industry.\n When I was a teenager in the 70s, early 80s, I outside for a week and turned the town hall,\n there was always a nice thick layer of coal from the nearby coal power plant on the window sill of our house.\n It's not there anymore for 30 years. Because we're going through completely different conditions.\n So the key point is how do I achieve the standard of living through an increase in quality, which is ultimately also growth-related, and to proceed with a resource-saving approach.\n For example, this can be recreated.\n And that does not logically correspond with the claim to growth that is still represented by you.\n You don't say, or I didn't hear and read that, you don't say growth only as far as the absolute of the resource does not exceed.\n No, we're not going that far.\n Yes, but the question is, if we discuss this in the long term,\n in view of the question of when the resources are so exhausted that our Earth cannot survive anymore.\n For example, at 2. how many degrees?\n Yes, but then we are at a very specific point."

However, the legal health insurance system as we know it today did not exist at that time. Initially, the health insurance covered only a small percentage of the population, mainly factory workers and their families. The insurance was mandatory for workers and those earning a weekly wage of six thalers or less.\n\nBefore the Second World War, the legal health insurance system was quite different. It was primarily focused on sick leave benefits, with around 60% of the expenses being spent on sick leave. Employees in the civil law book were entitled to six weeks of sick leave, while workers only got a maximum of three days. The health insurance companies were responsible for covering the costs of sick leave beyond that period.\n\nA significant change occurred in the 1950s when a major strike in Schleswig-Holstein led to the implementation of sick pay for both employees and workers. This marked the end of the six-week sick leave entitlement for employees and the beginning of employer-funded",

The difference is not that big, because the private health insurance also pays the same fees, the same case fees as the legal ones.\n The health insurance pays for that, but then you also have to have a special tariff or an extra insurance,\n actually only chief physician treatment and two beds.\n And whether the chief physician treatment is the better one, I dare to doubt.\n So I don't have an additional insurance. I would give the same amount of money in the hospital as a cash patient.\n This is a waste of money, the private health insurance.\n Because for the same amount of money, for the same services, about 50 to 70 percent more is paid than in the legal health insurance.\n So it's one of those fairy tales that this is a two-class medicine.

That was always untouched.

The increase in contributions can be attributed to the increasing tendency for healthcare spending, which is economically explainable due to the personal intensive and service-oriented nature of the healthcare industry.\nRetirement benefits play a significant role in the development of health insurance contributions, particularly in relation to private health insurance companies. These companies have their own funds to cover the costs of aging, which they use to cover the increasing costs associated with age. As a result, health insurance contributions are mainly aimed at the age of entry, with later entry resulting in higher costs.

Nothing.\n For me, there is nothing to say about doctors being called to the best-earned jobs.\n That's a highly qualified job that has to be paid well.\n The limits are of course there, where it is tried to gain extra profits through excessive performance. This is partly a problem that must be addressed.\n This is a very complex problem when it comes to pricing in health care.\n Because this cannot run across the market.\n Most health economists agree that health care is characterized by market failure.\n This simply is mainly related to the dominant role of doctors.\n Because they have the social mandate to define who is sick and what the therapy looks like.\n That's completely fine, who else should do that? Someone has to do it.\n But at the same time, the possibility of taking advantage of this, let's say, business, is growing.\n And it would be naive to assume that this does not happen.\n So doctors are not nobler than all other people, they also want to, there are also financial incentives.\n But that is also true, and that is now being realized so slowly, I hope also this is because the economic control of the health system is only short-lived\n in terms of prices and profit incentives.\n We have a really good supply in international comparison.\n You can say that everything is fine, but that doesn't mean that there are no problems.\n And there are in a number of ways.\n For example, we have a large regional imbalance, both in the supply density and in the quality of care or in the frequency.\n So, in terms of supply density, it is completely clear that there cannot be this kind of hospital care in the country as in the city.\n That was in the past. I come from Meck-Pom in the GDR, there were always these polyclinics\n and so on, there was a lot of ...\n That's another one of the structural errors of the German system.\n For example, many mistakes have been made in the German Union and one of the biggest\n was to dismantle this actually very modernly organized GDR health system.\n It was hopelessly underfunded and the facilities were in a deplorable state.\n So what I saw at the beginning, the neck of my head was curling.\n But I have to say, the doctors and nurses working there are really admired\n how they have preserved quality of care. But the whole organization, this stagged system of individual practices,\n ambulatories, polyclinics, also regional, connection to hospitals,\n that was what we discussed in the 80s in West Germany,\n that our system should be changed like that.\n That was bad, that was bad for the GDR, right?\n Yes, but hello. No, but that, no, also because that was discussed in the 80s in West Germany,\n then those, especially in the organized medical staff, so the forces that didn't want to screw us up,\n prevented that in the agreement.

I am an economist and you also have to have a lawyer who knows lawmaking well.\n But I mean, there are already ...\n Sometimes we have thought things out among our colleagues.\n Now nothing comes to mind spontaneously, but I mean, the the word health reform is a wrong word.\n There is a very nice quote by Loriot, the great one.\n He had a mirror interview, that was about 10 years ago.\n They asked him for his favorite word.\n He said, dental replacement, additional insurance, but actually health reform,\n because some health can't actually reform, if I understand that correctly.\n So that's full, so the, the, the, the, also the, the names of the laws, that's, that's special.\n So, um, they're called GKV solidarity strengthening law or, so, um, so that's, that is for everyone who has a bit of a language aesthetic\n feeling and I count on them that is always very painful but\n lawyers do not take care of it so that we are there for example that one again\n then your journalists had a wonderful abbreviation for it found I found a shortcut for that.\n GKV-Finance-Quality-Embedding-Law. That's what the journalists thought of GKV-Fuck-WG.\n GKV-F, that was a abbreviation for GKV-FWG or FQWG.\n And that's what journalists said, GKV-Fuck-WG.\n And from that we then said to journalists, as I said, GKV, FaktWG. So that is, to read such a law is actually just something for experts, that is so hard.\n Because that's what it says in there and paragraph 73b of the Social Law 5 of the SGP is changed so and so.\n Then you have to look at the law first, what was it before and what are the changes?\n So one of my jobs was always the housekeeper, so to speak, to clarify these changes.\n What does that mean now?\n And then I always read through the justification of laws first, because it said what it was all about.\n And so that's a very, very, very, very specific job.\n So that's a very specific job.\n The system of law in health insurance or private insurance consists of many different health insurance companies. Why are there so many? Or is it good because there are people on the market who can choose?\n The lecturers argue that it is historically dependent.\n And a common saying is that if something is not explainable, it is historically dependent.\n That means it has developed and no political majority has found a way to change it.\n For us, this comes from the Bismarck social law, which I mentioned earlier,\n that the old aid associations were integrated into this system on the basis of mutual assistance.\n At the time, Bismarck originally wanted to have an AOK for everyone, so to speak.\n And it was also by the 1960s, by far, the largest cash system with more than half of the insured.\n In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria they still have more than half of the GKV members still have half of the money. But this led to the addition of the business health insurance, the insurance for the disabled and the health insurance for the disabled.\n And then, in the 1930s and especially in the 1980s, the law, the replacement health insurance, which were all professionally organized."

Prior to this, the health care system was professionally organized, with different choices depending on whether an individual was a worker, an employee, or a craftsman. This led to a system of fraud and huge contribution differences between different health insurance companies, with some workers paying up to 17% more for their health insurance compared to others.\nThe turning point came when the Federal Social Court ruled in favor of a worker's insurance company, Steinfurt, in a case against the Federal Government. The court found that workers were being discriminated against by being forced to remain in their expensive AOK health insurance and unable to switch to cheaper replacement cash. This ruling, known as the Stantepede decision, paved the way for the introduction of the free cash vote.\nThe free cash vote allowed employees to choose between different health insurance companies, leading to a more competitive market and a more balanced distribution of health care costs.

This is explained by the fact that\n over 80-year-olds, or over-aged people,\n can or should not make certain interventions.\n Yes, because that would be...\n For economic reasons?\n For medical reasons.\n I'll put it this way, it could be a attempted suicide.\n Because these interventions are already done before,\n be it a new hip or cataract surgery or something like that.\n So the influence of age on health expenses is generally overestimated.\n It's rising, but it's not unpaid.\n If it were unpaid, you couldn't do it.\n That means that old people would be screwed up or would not receive medical treatment anymore.\n But that's nonsense.\n Behind it is unpaid, that is, the health insurance should not pay it.\n But that the private ones are cheaper, you really can't deny that.\n That is one of the fairy tales and myths, that everything will become more expensive through demographic development.\n At the moment, we even have a very clear rejuvenation in the legal health insurance process,\n which also relates to the migration movements.\n So all these forecasts that are always in the press about a demographic catastrophe, that's bullshit.\n That's absolute bullshit, because I once had the fun of looking at demographic forecasts of the 50s.\n It was absurd what they predicted.\n The decline in births, that was also connected to the births,\n the, let's say, the strong years of men in war.\n But that there are so-called refugee movements,\n that people came from the GDR, later guest workers.\n The pill-crack you could not foresee.\n That's why such demographic forecasts, which are beyond 5 to 10 years,\n are becoming more and more insidious, the more they grab.\n So if you see today, forecasts until 2060, complete nonsense.\n It has no say.\n You say it in a pauschal way, right?\n Yes, no, because that's actually what the Statistical Office says in their population prognoses in the introduction.\n Unfortunately, the journalists don't read it.\n They say these are status quo high rates.\n That means that would happen if nothing else happened.\n Otherwise, if the population structures remain the same.\n And that's a very brave assumption to assume that.\n Productivity developments are not taken into account at all.\n For example, with the productivity of the 60s, we couldn't afford an education system like today.\n It wouldn't work.\n 25% of people graduate school. It just didn't work. You're not a doctor, but I'm trying to...\n I mean, doctors are getting better and better, we're getting better and better trained,\n our medical technology is getting better and the early warning systems are getting better and better.\n Everything is getting better and better from a medical point of view.\n Are people in Germany getting healthier thanks to our health system?\n They are getting older, but that is partly due to the medical system.\n The growing life expectancy of over 60-year-olds, that is my generation, has a lot to do with medicine. After the change of the world, it was observed in the new countries\n that the mortality rate for heart attacks and stroke\n has dropped drastically, especially in people over 50 to 60 years old.\n And this has also significantly increased the life expectancy of people over 50 years old,\n relatively short-term.\n But in general, life expectancy at birth birth only coincides very little with the medicine."

            "reference_answer": "\nThe belief that over 80-year-olds account for a disproportionate amount of healthcare costs is based on the Faust rule, which states that 80% of healthcare costs are incurred by 20% of the population. This group is primarily made up of chronic and severe patients, including the elderly. However, it is argued that the influence of age on healthcare costs is overestimated, and that the increase in costs for the elderly is not entirely unpaid. Instead, it is suggested that private insurance may be cheaper for older individuals, and that demographic forecasts predicting a demographic catastrophe due to aging populations are not reliable. The argument against the disproportionate healthcare costs for the elderly is based on the fact that medical advancements and early warning systems are improving, leading to better health outcomes and increased life expectancy for older individuals. Additionally, productivity developments are not taken into account in demographic forecasts, which could lead to significant cost savings in the future.",

They have of course completely different interests.\n And what the politics succeeded in, there is still a association of generic manufacturers,\n then there is still a association of pharmaceutical manufacturers,\n who represent natural health and homeopathy and so on.\n The politics has already managed to split the pharmaceutical industry, so to speak,\n also through this fixed-cost system.\n That was already...\n Then the big corporations said, we don't care anymore.\n But a leading pharmaceutical manager once said a few years ago that this\n fixed-cost system was a blessing in the end for the big companies,\n because they\n earned themselves stupid and stupid before and how that is, once made a monopoly community,\n you get comfortable and don't even notice what excessive costs you have in your shop.\n That would have forced them to really look at their structures and\n found an enormous wave of rationalization. So that's, as I said, the power of the pharmaceutical industry in the USA is much bigger than\n ours. That's for sure right. That's also a problem here in general. I also know people\n who work for large American pharmaceutical companies. They always have big problems explaining to their colleagues in the central\n in New York or elsewhere or Boston how the German health system works.\n That you can't just call Ms. Merkel here and say, now change our\n pharmaceutical price system, that this is a bit more difficult here.\n There are also quite a few German corporations, like Bayer or Merck, who know how to deal with it, but the Americans don't always understand it.\n You just said homeopathy.

            "reference_answer": "\nThe Association of Research and National Medicines Manufacturers (Vereinigung der Arzneimittelforschungs- und Nationalerzeuger e.V., or VAN) is a leading association in the German pharmaceutical industry, representing the interests of major pharmaceutical corporations such as Bayer, Pfizer, and others. It differs from the Federal Association of Ph pharmaceutical Industries (Bundesverband der Pharmaceutischen Industrie e.V., or BPI) in terms of representation and interests. While the BPI is the traditional interest group for the entire pharmaceutical industry, the VAN specifically represents the interests of large research-based pharmaceutical companies. The VAN's focus is on research and development, and its members are primarily engaged in the production of innovative, patented medicines. In contrast, the BPI represents a broader range of pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug manufacturers and those involved in natural health and homeopathy. The fixed-cost system implemented in the German healthcare system has led to a shift in power within the pharmaceutical industry, with the VAN and other large corporations adapting more easily to the new regulatory environment.

Why do German health insurance companies pay homeopathic treatments, medicine, etc. The question is completely justified, but it does not belong to the compulsory services.\n These are which are not really a big risk. Actually, it's homeopathy, I say that very clearly,\n that's charlatanism, there are enough evidence for that.\n But now, you have to say that a good doctor always has a certain repertoire of placebos.\n Because placebos sometimes have a felt effect at least. But\n overall, the question is completely justified why the health insurance company has to pay for that.\n What role do the hospitals play, the hospital industry?\n Well, you have to see first, it is divided into three. There There is also about a third of the market share.\n That is the private ones, Helios, Asklepios, Rh\u00f6n, the big hospital corporations.\n Then there are the free-of-use, mostly church, so Diakonie or Caritas.\n They also have about a third of the market share.\n And then the municipal hospitals. They each have very different\n structures, but they all get the same case quotas from the hospitals. The\n private ones usually make profits by specializing. The problem with these case-reference It was developed in the US and imported to Germany.\n We have developed our own DRG system.\n These are all average prices for defined performance.\n The problem with the price finding for such prices in the health care system is that they always depend on average costs.\n But the single case is often different from these average costs.\n There are cases where even with the same diagnosis,\n sometimes less effort is needed, sometimes more.\n You can't determine that from the beginning.\n And that's why hospitals with high cases\n or with specialization have cost advantages,\n because they can then reduce the fixed costs in these areas\n , the operating costs also play a role, so energy and so on,\n and that is why private hospitals have often specialized in certain\n disease patterns and the whole thing is a bit to the disadvantage of basic care.\n That's a problem.\n That's why we basically have, because the whole development in medicine is about\n that more and more ambulances can be made.\n And that you really only do the special things in the hospital.\n And that also requires a completely different organization.\n So these small hospitals are simply no longer viable.\n But there are always huge protests in the population, I can understand that,\n when a hospital is to be closed or a department to be closed.\n Because you have the feeling that we no longer have any care here in our vicinity.\n But that is on the other hand, you can just have 120 births a year can also be done at the expense of quality and safety.\n Because they don't have the experience.\n Or in other areas, for example, hip surgery or something like that,\n small hospitals often don't do that in the required number of cases.\n There are also legal provisions that hospitals should provide for certain areas a required number of cases. There are also legal regulations that hospitals for certain areas in a certain\n number of services per year to provide, because that is clearly proven, the higher\n the number of cases, the better the quality of care. Simply because there is routine,\n because they know a lot about it and that's just the way it is. But that's a question,\n a structural problem of our care system, which I just said, this strict separation from ambulant and stationary.\n That's why we have made it much too much stationary, that it is actually made ambulant.\n That is also one of the wrong claims, that the health system has no rationalization effects.\n But they have enormous rationalization effects, but they have enormous rationalization effects. Only through the development of anesthesia are things no longer necessary in the stationary care\n because you can also make them ambulant. So cataract surgery or\n things like that.

            "reference_answer": "\nPrivate hospitals in the German healthcare system account for about a third of the market share alongside public hospitals, which are mostly church-affiliated organizations like Diakonie or Caritas, and municipal hospitals. Private hospitals often have cost advantages due to their specialization and the ability to reduce fixed costs in specific areas. This is because the German healthcare system uses a DRG (Diagnosis-Related Groups) system, which sets average prices for defined performance. However, the single case often varies from these average costs, and hospitals with high cases or specialization have an advantage. The problem is that this system can disadvantage basic care and lead to the closure of small hospitals. Private hospitals often focus on specialized care and have a different organization than public hospitals. Legal provisions require hospitals to provide a certain number of services per year for certain areas to ensure quality care. The strict separation between ambulant and stationary care in the German healthcare system is a structural problem, leading to an overemphasis on stationary care and a lack of rationalization. Despite this, the healthcare system has enormous potential for rationalization through the development of anesthesia and the ability to make more procedures ambulant.",

It is understandable that everyone has his Euro-sign in his eye, even if it is dominated.\n The danger is that we have good special care, but the basic care suffers from it.\n So it is also, especially in ambulances, we actually have in the\n medical care, partly a over-care and in all\n dentists a sub-care.

But all these supply differences city-country, that's a huge problem.\n You can only solve this through an integrated supply of ambulances and stationary facilities,\n from hospitals to care centers and from surrounding other groups of doctors.\n And now I want to do a lot for our care system in Spain.\n There are often too few nurses and caretakers.\n What is in the bill is good, it is also okay.\n I have problems with some things, for example that the costs for care should be calculated from the case quotas.\n I have problems with that, you could have done that yourself through changing the case quotas,\n that you better balance the care activity in these case quotas.\n That would also have been a possibility.\n But the problem will of course be, as it always is,\n when you change structural problems, you still suffer under the old structures.\n There is simply no such number of nurses.\n Because this profession has simply been neglected too much in the past.\n That's generally the case now, not only in the health sector, but also elsewhere.\n We can now just see what the consequences\n of these savings systems\n of the 90s and 2000s.\n As Wovereit said, you have to save until it squeaks.\n But if it squeaks, it takes 15 to 20 years until it stops squeaking,\n because the infrastructure has to be rebuilt,\n which has been destroyed by that.\n And that's the same in the health care system.\n And if you treat the health care system with such strong medical attention for years,\n if you have such a strong neglect of the nursing profession,\n then it cannot be changed by push of a button and with more money,\n but the training system must be re-established.\n There is already a relatively good law on the training of nurses.\n That was also made difficult in the last legislative period.\n And it always takes a while for all of that to take hold.\n And it will be similar with the provision of money for more positions.\n So the money is there. That has never been the problem in general.\n The problem has always been that people have not been trained for it.\n Do we need a full-fledged health insurance? We don't have that. I would be in favor of it, although there will be no full insurance.\n That was a political compromise.\n When the joint project of the SPD and the Union was introduced in 1994, it was clear that only a part-time insurance could be made.\n Why not full-time insurance?\n Why not everything?\n That was politically not acceptable at the time.

He proposes the establishment of medical care facilities in districts, which would secure the supply in the area. He also suggests that Sister Agnes, or similar healthcare professionals, visit older people in villages to assess their medical needs and provide necessary treatment. Reiners acknowledges that doctors and visiting the house are not necessarily well paid, and there is a problem with care supply differences between urban and rural areas. He suggests an integrated supply of ambulances and stationary facilities to solve this issue.\nRegarding the shortage of nurses and caretakers in Spain's healthcare system, Reiners acknowledges that the problem is structural and cannot be solved by simply increasing funding. He believes that the training system for nurses needs to be re-established, as the profession has been neglected in the past. He also mentions that there is already a relatively good law on the training of nurses but that it has been made difficult in recent legislative periods. Reiners believes that it will take time for these changes to take effect.",

And that's not true in terms of the numbers, but these are the ideologies that you have to deal with in politics.\n The health system is often overshadowed by myths that only have to do with the real problems.\n These are not lies. Good bullshitter do not lie.\n They work out reality selectively, as it suits their ideas.\n And so it is in politics in general, but in the health sector it is particularly pronounced, because it is not just about politics, pure politics, but about the spread of a very lucrative economic branch.\n And you have to see that very soberly, whether that fits you.\n I mean, it's a problem too.\n I mean, doctors, that's my personal experience, also in dealing with doctors is that they have difficulties with it, especially doctors who take their job seriously, that they earn money.\n Many of them don't want a problem with them earning good money.\n Not the least.\n But they often feel that in private conversations,\n I have doctors in my circle of friends,\n but as soon as it becomes public, there is an aggressive mood when it comes to money.\n They immediately feel it as a accusation, which is not meant to be.\n So that's difficult.\n But that's another problem that in our case, in terms of health,\n the whole question of ethics and quality has always come too short.\n What is medical ethics?\n How far can we go?\n You can't make fixed rules there.\n Until then it is okay to earn money morally and ethically,\n but then it will be a mess.\n Who wants to set these limits?\n Where is the limit between normal business goals and profit maximization?\n You can say that in individual cases.\n If people, which is common in certain medical practices, are being swindled some performance,\n which is excessive, if not even harmful, just to increase the bill, then that is not ethical for me.\n So it basically only has to be done what is medically necessary.\n But to set standards for that, to regulate that, that's very difficult.\n Because what I said earlier, every single case is different.\n That makes the whole thing very difficult.\n In a single case, certain measures can be\n required, but not in the other. And that is, you can't just do cookbook medicine\n and say, so and so, of course there are certain general rules. And I would also say,\n for most medical cases in the medical practice, there are general rules there is there but I have there once\n so investigations gave the say said that only four or five percent of the common\n therapies and diagnoses are medically evident that means that they really do something\n bring another 50 percent could be assumed that they bring something and the rest is actually unacclared.\n I don't think so much about it.

My name is Andreas Gassen and I am the chairperson of the Kassen\u00e4rztlichen Bundesvereinigung.\n What is that?\n That's a good question. I'm not sure if all doctors know that.\n The Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung is the roof organization of the Kassen\u00e4rztlichen Vereinigung.\n There are two of them in every federal state. There 17 in total, and we are the roof organization.\n What is a cashier?\n A cashier is someone who has a permit to treat legally insured patients.\n Why does he need a permit for that?\n That has grown historically. There were negotiations in the early 20th century where themselves dealt with the health insurance companies themselves.\n That was relatively difficult and did not really work out well and was actually\n to the disadvantage of the doctors. Then many querels emerged from this situation and many querels,\n the health insurance associations, which took on this role for the doctors in their\n entirety to negotiate the contracts with the health insurance companies. This has developed over a while and I think around 1931 this system was established\n and basically linked two things.\n On the one hand, they said, well, we take this contract business away from the doctors,\n hand it over to these health insurance associations.\n For this, they get an exclusivity right for the treatment of legally insured patients.\n Conversely, they also make sure that people are taken care of and do not have to go to the strike court.\n That was the deal back then.\n That's how the Kassen\u00e4rztlichen Vereinigung was created and since then it exists.\n Are we still not allowed to strike?\n No, we are not allowed to strike.\n It is also difficult in principle, because most of the contract doctors, as we call them, sound a bit nicer, are self-employed.\n In this respect, it doesn't really make sense to strike your own shop.\n But basically it is like this, we are not allowed to strike, we are not allowed to burn.\n Is a cashier always a house doctor?\n No, that doesn't matter. It's just about the bill in this case.\n That means, legally insured patients, house doctor, specialist, psychotherapist, will be there.\n Is there a hospital too? A doctor, a specialist, a psychotherapist, etc. The hospital as well? In the hospital there are some solutions. The hospitals calculate according to a different system and not over us.\n But if a hospital doctor treats ambulant patients, for example, then he would get a partial compensation.\n That is perhaps a very important point. It is only for the ambulant care.\n So we have nothing to do with the hospital treatment.\n And are you satisfied with this system? Well, the system is already old, I just said, and of course it is increasingly at the financial limits in a dynamic development of medicine and technology.\n As always, it is usually uncomfortable with money.\n And we have a situation that was the case in the old construction, that the lawful health insurance companies paid a pre-arranged amount and then it was all performance that was lost.\n That means depending on how much performance was burned, it could be a bad business or a good one.\n So there was extremely little burning, if it was a good business.\n Unhappy, not completely unexpected, but the demand for performance continuously increases the is constantly increasing, which is why we have budgets.\n You may have heard of this.\n If a contract doctor provides services for legally insured patients, he writes a kind of virtual bill.\n At the end of the day, however, he receives a bill for 100 euros, depending on where he is registered and depending on how much money is negotiated.\n Maybe only 90 or 85 euros."

It was established historically as a result of negotiations in the early 20th century where doctors dealt directly with health insurance companies, which proved to be difficult and disadvantageous for doctors. Many complaints and disputes arose from this situation, and the health insurance associations took on the role of negotiating contracts with the health insurance companies on behalf of the doctors. This system was established around 1931 and essentially linked two things: the health insurance associations took on the contract business with the health insurance companies, and in return, they ensured that legally insured patients were taken care of and did not have to go to the strike court. This deal established the Kassen\u00e4rztlichen Vereinigung.\nThe Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung is responsible for representing the interests of cashier doctors, who are doctors with a permit to treat legally insured patients.

The prices? Who decides the prices?\n The prices are, in contrast to private medical treatment, not really fixed in euros and cents,\n but we have a very bizarre way of doing it. Some people talk about\n shell money. We have a so-called uniform rating measure that\n clauses the performance in relation to each other and their rating.\n This is put in points. It seems a bit like Club Med and this point has a value.\n And we negotiate this point value, the Kassenetz-Bundesvereinigung,\n which should ideally rise or or at least as much as costs develop.\n That doesn't always work. When my colleagues ask outside, they say it never works.\n We think it sometimes fits, sometimes it doesn't fit so well.\n But that's the point why, in addition to the not necessarily calculable health care, it can also come to a down payment.\n And you want to collect more and more points, right?\n Yes, the points don't bring a lot, that's the problem.\n If I have a sum of 100 euros and I can theoretically get 50 points, I get 100 euros.\n Or I can get 200 points, then it makes sense to get a lot of points.\n Basically, the system is at its limits, which is why we are increasingly demanding that this coverage and this budgeting be left behind and\n instead simply pay what is brought in. Why do the cashiers not find it so\n prickly? It would actually be fairer.

And then we come with eight people and say, we ate eight pizzas.\n And then he says, no problem, he paid five.\n So in this respect, it is actually common in normal economic life\n that what is demanded is also paid.\n This is not always the case with the deceased colleagues.\n What does a pizzeria have to do with a doctor's practice?\n Both are self-employed entrepreneurs and have liabilities, rent, staff and bring their work.\n Is there a legal pizza basic supply in Germany?\n No, but there are free prices for the pizzas. That means a particularly good pizzeria can take a lot for the pizza and a pizzeria that is not so great is less.\n Then it depends on the standard of the pizzeria. But in Germany the price is the same everywhere. Why?

It plays a significant role in negotiating the point value for medical services in the German health insurance system. The point value is a measure used to determine the reimbursement for medical services provided to legally insured patients. The KBV aims to ensure that the point value rises or at least keeps pace with cost developments. However, this process is not always successful, and some doctors may feel that they are not receiving adequate compensation for their services.\nThe process of negotiating point values for medical services in the German health insurance system is compared to paying a fixed price for services in a restaurant in the following way: Both doctors and pizzerias are self-employed entrepreneurs with liabilities, rent, and staff. However, while there are free prices for pizzas in a restaurant, there is no legal pizza basic supply in Germany. In contrast, medical services in the German health insurance system are subject to a collective contract, which makes the negotiation process more complex. The KBV would like to move towards paying a fixed price for medical services, as this is more common in",

We have that, in principle,\n you have to say, we used to have a situation that was completely different in many areas.\n Hospitals were originally almost always mildly operated. They never earned money in\n the earlier days, were sponsored by rich citizens or. They never earned money. In the earlier times they were sponsored\n by rich citizens or the church or something. Nowadays the market has been brought into health care,\n also in hospitals. They are supposed to bring profitability, they are supposed to calculate. You can do that,\n it's always a bit difficult. In this respect I share the assessment. Market and health are things\n that don't always fit together well. And I think you have to weigh that well.\n You have to define areas where the market is rather unfavorable and then there are certainly areas where the market would be acceptable from my point of view.\n Is there a market between the house doctor and the house nurse, the cashier?\n A market in what way?\n Yes, so one house doctor is a competitor to the other two.\n In theory, yes. If there were a lot of doctors, you would see that you have enough patients to get through.\n But since we have a higher need than the colleagues can cover, there is no competition.\n Everyone has more than enough to do.\n I looked, in Berlin there are a lot of doctors, cash doctors compared to Brandenburg.\n How can that be?\n Well, now you could of course say quite blatantly, it is also a certain question of the demography.\n We currently have 3.5 million inhabitants in Berlin, Brandenburg just under 2.1 million.\n And Brandenburg loses 200,000 people to Berlin every 10 years Brandenburg just under 2.1 million and Brandenburg loses\n in the middle every 10 years 200,000 people to Berlin, so they just leave. Brandenburg\n is of course large, area-wise enormously large, thin-settled, which of course always\n represents a challenge. That is also a problem for us or more for the KVs,\n who have to solve that, who also have to ensure the security,\n so that treatment is required and possible everywhere.\n You are obliged to do this, right? Not the health insurance?\n Exactly, we are obliged to do this.\n But you just said health insurance.\n No, the health insurance association.\n Oh, okay.\n I may have been snorting. No, it's the health insurance association.\n And the larger the country is and the thinner it is settled, the more challenging it is, of course.\n And it is actually clear, because a medical practice also needs a certain amount of people to be able to calculate.\n This is different for each group of professionals. The dentists need the least population share, because everyone should go to the dentist.\n And the more specialized, the greater the population share, because you rarely go to a radiologist or even less often to a nuclear medicine doctor. That means I need a certain amount of people to make such a practice bearable.\n And the thinner a country is, the larger the course of the way to be covered."

This contractual relationship results in equality of voices, making it difficult to change prices and leading to constant struggles and the need for a schiedsgremium to decide disputes. The KBV would prefer to dictate prices, but it's not that simple due to this collective contract.\nThe KBV's role in determining prices for medical services differs significantly from a free market system. In a free market system, prices are determined by supply and demand, and competition among providers drives down prices. However, in the case of medical services, the market and health are not always favorable, and the KBV's role is more complex due to the collective contract with health insurance companies. The market and health are not always easily comparable, and the constant struggle to decide who has more right in a given year makes it difficult to establish a true free market system.",

We have an extremely low-intensity care.\n In Germany, you can go to any doctor or any doctor, get treated, for some part.\n Very interesting, I did an examination to get the topic a little bit more in-depth.\n There are people who have three house doctors in parallel. I don't know where the sensuality lives in it.\n Or two rhinoplasty doctors. I can still understand my second opinion, but that someone eats two or three houses is absurd. But that's also possible. And of course these are things\n that you would have to regulate more. This is also done in other countries.\n Every patient can only eat one house.\n For example, there are also splinters.

Now it's about what you have to do.\n I understood the solution. Sure, supply today, top. Soon, not anymore. I could say for example, look, the care is getting more difficult now, it can't be that you keep two or three doctors in parallel anymore, you have to decide for one.\n Yes, but now you're talking about the patients, I'm listen up guys, that someone has a home doctor, completely okay,\n rhinoplasty, ear doctor, out-doctor, wonderful, but that someone in one quarter\n has two or three colleagues of the same field, is hardly medically reasonable.\n So, and then we say, and that's easy, there used to be the insurance, there was a insurance,\n you gave it away and then it was gone.

                "Beautiful, but there are also many areas.\n And that makes it difficult.\n What I want to say is that it will not lead to more colleagues being left in the country\n if I take them to the Zinstenplatz and say, you have to go there for two years.\n Because how is such a practice supposed to work?\n So I have to close a rental contract in a doubt for ten years, build a practice in there and say, after two years I'm gone again.\n I think the hope is that a few will say, I stay.\n Yes, but then I think you can tease them more.\n What we do, for example, or many medical students do, is that they actually do so-called country hospitations medical students and a lot of people say, I wouldn't have imagined that so exciting.\n So there are already possibilities. I think this national doctor's quota is more of a marketing gag.\n I remember back in the day, if you didn't get a place to study, you could study\n in the Bundeswehr. A few completely exhausted people did that,\n studied in the Bundeswehr. There was no NC. But you had to serve as a chief physician.\n Unless you paid the debt back.\n And there were two or three very smart people who put the money on the bank and after a\n study they put it on the table and then said goodbye to the service of the Bundeswehr.\n So that works. There are always environmental strategies. I think you have to rule by\n conviction and not by such unbearable incentives.\n My old housewife from Meck-Pom wants to retire, but has a problem finding a successor for her practice.\n You have to help her. How can you help?\n We are actually trying. There is also a campaign that I think is not so badly done.\n It's called Leave Yourself Down, where we even do such form-and-file stock exchanges, practice stock exchanges,\n to bring the young, the young with the old, together.\n That often works fine. They then sometimes go into the practices, if the old practice owners are still in there,\n to get a little bit of the patient's blood running and learn a few things.\n But it doesn't work everywhere. But we're there, but it's really not easy.\n In this respect, the point is justified. It also makes us gray hair.\n You can see that.\n Thank you. But it is what it is. I learned these days that there is not only a council of experts for environmental issues, which the Federal Republic of Germany advises on climate, but there is also a council of experts on the evaluation and development of the health care system.\n They have also dealt with the lack of doctors in the country. Do you know the requirements?\n There are so many.\n There is one good one. I'm curious what you say.\n Let's hear it. They demand a 50% higher allowance for housewives in under-insured regions.\n You as a KBV type would have to say, allowance, higher allowance, yes of course.\n It's even there. Interestingly, especially Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has an extremely high rate of payments.\n That means that in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, there is an extremely high rate of payments. That means that in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern you earn more money than in Berlin.\n But I do believe, and you are closer to it because you are younger,\n that the new medical generation cannot catch up with the money through the trigger alone.\n But it helps.\n Yes, but it is not enough.\n I think it would be a relatively simple mechanism if I said I'll put more money in there.\n That helps, but we really asked which size order should come so that someone can leave somewhere where they actually want to leave.\n These are frightening sizes.\n Say it again.\n And that's only about six-digit amounts.\n That means? Make it concrete.\n Quite different.\n They want to earn 100,000 euros more a year than the doctor in the city.\n Yes, they want to have incentives, for example, if they do it at all.\n So first of all, it's very little and then the practice practically doesn't cost anything and then you have to have a sales guarantee.\n You can think about that. That would actually have to, because that would blow up this collective contract at that moment this collective contract would explode."

That would actually have to, because that would blow up this collective contract at that moment this collective contract would explode.\n You would then have to go and say, and we have already suggested this,\n if a community says, we really want to have a house medical care and we don't get one,\n then you can of course incentivize it.\n You can rent practice rooms for small money and things like that work in individual cases.\n But there is no one size fits all. We don't have a general concept where we can say there is a sum of x and if we add that up it goes from Berlin Mitte to I don't know where.\n But that has to be your idea. How do I get the house M4 when you get out of M4. The problem is very simple. That's why I say that crude money is not enough.\n It would be relatively expensive, but simple. Most people have a relationship in some form.\n That means that life partners in the academic environment often have to come to terms with this living situation and this lifestyle and have fun.\n So let's say a woman is a doctor, a man is an architect. Then she says, I have a great practice in the Uckermark.\n Landscape is beautiful, I also go to the yacht, everything is great, and then he says, what should I build there? Then it goes on with schools.\n I don't want to introduce the opera, most people want to say, there has to be an opera, no one goes to the opera. But these things, the life situation has to fit for the life partner, it has to fit the community in terms of the future to be built.\n And then it gets complicated and it's more than just cheap money. The Secretary of State also said that you should support the provision of nursing homes, for example, so that there is a child-friendly environment.\n That you also demand that there are enough children's day-caps in the country.\n Yes, but then the communities who make a living could build children's day-caps.\n That's not our goal. So the problem is pretty much named exactly. We have the problem in\n these regions that the medical care often goes away last. But of course it is\n perceived in a particularly painful way. But before that, the bank branch was gone, the baker was gone,\n the supermarket was gone, with us the police were gone, the fire department is gone, the volunteers are gone.\n And then the house nurse or the house doctor is gone.\n And of course that is perceived as extremely unpleasant in a comprehensible way.\n But the problem is, and that's why we're challenged at this point, but we can't do it on our own,\n because it's a structure weakness that has been created overall,\n where often the health care is the last anchor of attractiveness for the community. And that's just the point, you can't get anywhere.\n So it only works with all players.\n You don't come from the countryside, that's no secret. How would you have been\n brought up on the countryside after MV?\n Probably not me, because I'm actually a big city kid.\n Although I think the country is really beautiful.\n But we really need people like you in the country. How do we get you there?\n What incentives do you need Andreas Gessen?\n Well, I would say my trade fair is almost in that area.\n I wouldn't be a successor to the country anymore.\n If you were 20, 30 years younger.\n So, frankly speaking, I wouldn't have gone to the country.\n I have to say that bluntly.\n It would not have come from the situation that my wife is a lawyer.

She probably would have told me something else.\n We also have crimes.\n But it would not have happened. As I said, I can imagine a life on the land in phases, but I probably would't have been able to imagine it at 20 or 30.\n You are basically representative for your doctor, because that represents the problem. I don't go to the country.\n I am representative for a large part of the current generation. We have an urbanization, the urbanization that actually almost depopulate the country.\n And these population changes are real.\n And they don't just happen in purely rural states,\n but also in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n There we have rural space that is always denser.\n Everything goes into the cities. Actually not particularly reasonable, because the quality of life in the country is often significantly better.\n And if I live half an hour away from a larger city and come out of the corner, it's a question of whether that pays off at the end of the day.\n But it is a trend that can be observed here in Berlin in an extreme way.\n And that is a strain that affects all surrounding regions.\n But that is obviously not even a purely German phenomenon.\n We even see that in other European countries.\n This trend towards decontamination.\n Whether that's good, I don't want to judge, but it's just a fact.\n There are also doctors in other European countries.\n And somehow doctor associations.\n Do they have a plan?\n Do they have better plans than you?\n Or do they all have the same problems?\n There is actually ...\n What we have is not available in other countries.\n This physical system of the\n cash-in-the-bank association is also affecting other European neighboring countries.\n They don't understand it at all.\n How is it going there?\n Partly centralistic.\n Take Denmark. They have a health system that is often state-organized in Scandinavia.\n So doctors are mostly employed.\n In Holland, they actually went to the clinics and then to home-based health care.\n This is partly going back again because you find that it doesn't work that well either.\n So practically no one has the patent recipe.\n And you shouldn't forget that in most other countries we don't have,\n so let's take the Scandinavian countries as an example. Italy, France, Spain would pay a large amount of the insurance for the doctors by the patients themselves.\n That means we don't have the full insurance like we do for the entire population, which of course also results in completely different things in the offer and demand situation.\n So there is actually a lot more market. But you just spoke to Denmark. What would speak against it if, for example,\n the doctors and nurses who need McPom are then employed by the state?\n If you get some for that. There is nothing against that. So if someone says,\n we are now doing ...\n You have nothing against it?\n So I'm not afraid of competition, but we are now seeing the best example is the\n public health service. These are publicly funded medical institutions and not so many are there.\n You can expand or make it better.\n You have to take money into your hands. That might work.\n It also has the advantage that if I am employed somewhere, it is a different situation than if I am a private entrepreneur.\n But it's a fundamental decision.

I think, for example, it is of crucial importance that we have access to education, that it costs nothing.\n I think that's a high value.\n That's why I also find access to health insurance and health care extremely important.\n And those are values that are also important, because I believe education and health care is a kit that also holds a society together.\n These are things that are important so that everyone in society can also find a way.\n And that means access to education and access to health.\n But social inequality is often talked about wealth tax.\n I think sometimes these are just extreme measures. For example, I am not one of those who are unhappy, but the question is,\n is that a war decision or is it more important for us, how does society work anyway?\n These are of course things that are extremely clear.\n But political scientists always point out that it is\n dangerous for democracy if the rich always become richer.\n So I think what would be dangerous for democracy if we really drifted apart\n into such a upper and a lower class. And I think a great value in Germany was always that\n we actually had a relatively wide middle class.\n It is in principle to keep that, although the middle class, to be honest, does not automatically only focus on the net income,\n but also on things like quality of life, access to education, health and so on, so life conditions.\n The salaries are one, the wealth is the another. Would you like to pay your assets tax?\n I don't think it would be a bad idea to have to pay assets tax.\n I still think, even if you say with assets of many billions,\n that it has to be like that, I think it's the wrong approach.\n And I think, openly, it wouldn't be enough to cover the financial deficits we might have.\n It's a bit good, you feel good, you have given something away.\n Could help, right?\n Yes, I don't know if it really helps. There are many calculations that say, it sounds placardously enormous, but at the end of the day it's not enough to shoulder this volume.\n People might not be that rich again. You can only take away limited money.\n Do you belong to the upper class?\n Hm?\n You just spoke of upper class. Do you belong to the upper class? I saw you came in a Bentley backpack.\n I think I belong to the upper class.\n You mean the one who drives a Bentley?\n I make a good living, of course. I also work a lot. I probably count as one of the better-earned.\n Upper class is a term we know more from systems like England, where there are also old aristocratic structures.\n There is often a formal status associated with it. We don't have that in that form, thank God.\n I'm not a fan of monarchy, who wouldn't think so.\n In this respect, I think the term Oberschicht is difficult.\n But you belong to the top 10%, right?"

Are the German hips the worst in the world? No, I think that endoprothetics has a high quality in Germany.\n Then we have a situation where hip endoprothetics is also available.\n For example in the USA it is very expensive.\n In England hip endoprothetics is made according to QALYs.\n The English have a system where not everyone gets every injection.\n So if you exceed a certain age, for example, you won't get a hip endoprosthesis in England anymore.\n Because they say, well, now you're 80, then you can live the two years that are still statistical, you can also hump.\n That wouldn't be acceptable here. That means we then build these hips.\n Patients also like to take it because a hip operation, if it is done professionally, and it usually happens,\n offers very high functionality very quickly and the people are free of complaints.\n In the USA we have relatively less endoprothetics, but we have massive problems with drug abuse, for example.\n Because the people who have a hip failure have pain. So if I don't operate on them, they take the tablets.\n Regardless of that, you always have to ask the question, do you have to treat every hip joint disease with a hip endoprothesis?\n The question is the elephant in the room. And it has been asked for years and I know that a lot of studies have been done on it.\n And of course it is a claim that is always liked to be formulated. Everything that's not on the tree has a hip endoprothesis in it.\n I don't think the request is correct.\n You certainly have to question this critically.\n We also said that we have to set quality standards for this.\n This is also being done more and more.\n For example, one of the first registers that was created was for hip endoprotheses.\n By the operators, to meet exactly this request.\n To say that the indication, i.e. the reason for the hip injury\n is correctly chosen, it has been done, we have done it seriously, it has been done properly\n by an experienced team. Nevertheless, you always have to illuminate that.\n I have a friend who is also much older, he actually only needs a new hip,\n but he doesn't want to have it done yet, because it will run off at some point.\n No, it doesn't run off.\n Then he's afraid that he won't be able to perform a second hip.\n Every artificial joint has a standing time.

That was 10-15 years ago.\n There are now many patients with prosthetic hip surgery who have been running with the same hip for 20-25 years.\n In this respect, the problem has been somewhat relativized.\n But fundamentally, it is correct that the later you can do it, the better.\n It is crucial that you don't miss the timing."

            "reference_answer": "\nThe high number of hip operations per capita in Germany compared to other countries can be attributed to several factors. One reason is the availability and affordability of hip endoprotheses in Germany. In contrast to countries like the USA and England, where hip endoprotheses are either expensive or only provided based on specific criteria, Germany has a high number of hip endoprothesis surgeries due to the widespread availability and acceptance of this treatment option. Patients in Germany prefer hip endoprotheses over other treatments due to the quick recovery and high functionality they offer.\n\nHowever, the trend of performing a high number of hip operations per capita in Germany has potential consequences for the healthcare system. One concern is the cost of providing these procedures to a large population. Hip endoprothesis surgeries require significant investments in technology and infrastructure, and the cost of these procedures can add up quickly. Additionally, there is a risk of over-treatment, where patients receive hip endoprotheses unnecessarily, which can lead to unnecessary healthcare expenditures and potential harm to patients.\n\nAnother potential consequence of the high number of hip operations per capita in Germany is the strain on the healthcare",

We're sitting between all the chairs, you have to say. On the one hand, we are the KVs, have to implement many things that are not necessarily fun for the doctors.\n For example, we have to check honorifics, require quality assurance measures.\n So you are both a protection of interests and almost a bit of an supervisory authority, if that's the wrong term.\n But not only with positive connotations.\n I didn't really love the KV back then, because they were the ones who paid too little for us.\n Ulla Schmidt politicized me back then.\n We have young viewers here, they don't know Ulla Schmidt.\n She was a health minister.\n She was a health minister, she made the two legislatures.\n I think she was the only one who was a health minister twice in a row.\n And she had the idea of obliging the specialists from the Netherlands to go back to the clinics.\n And of course we just thought that was extremely funny.\n And as soon as you see it, you're in this political issue. political topic and then ... But how ... are you ... if you have a practice now, if you are a cashier, are you\n obliged to be a member of the association?\n Yes.\n Why?\n That's the way it is. It's a compulsory membership for the time ... as long as you ...\n You have to find shit as a liberal.\n Yes, that's why I say yes. But in case you are legally insured patient\n you can say, I don't do it, I'll let myself down on the green lawn,\n you can do that at any time.

            "reference_answer": "\nIn the late 1990s, doctors in D\u00fcsseldorf or Cologne had to pay a significant amount of money to take over an existing practice from a colleague due to various reasons. One reason was the requirement to pay off the cash register and apply for a new one. Additionally, the market prices for practices were a factor. Ulla Schmidt, a German health minister at the time, influenced the speaker's involvement in the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung (German Medical Association) when she made a proposal to oblige specialists from the Netherlands to return to the clinics. The speaker found this idea amusing and became involved in the political issue surrounding the KV, which was both an interest representation and a regulatory body for doctors. Doctors were required to be members of the KV for legal insurance purposes, but some chose to only treat private patients and not be members. The speaker mentioned that he would still issue bills to these patients and they would have to pay.",

His background differed from the previous chairmen in that he was not deeply entrenched in the political divisions between house and specialist doctors, which had been a major issue in the organization at the time. Gassen's lack of past involvement in the system allowed him to be seen as a neutral figure, making it easier for different factions to work together. Additionally, the position was originally a civil service job, but it had not been explicitly stated in the law how much the chairman would earn. Gassen and the board decided on his salary, which led to criticism from some doctors who felt he was being overpaid.

Why don't we do one?\n You have to ask the health insurance companies.\n What is your position?\n I don't care how many health insurance companies there are at the end of the day.\n Although I would put the thesis that the competition is actually the business at that point.\n If it were possible for the health insurance companies to do more competition for their insurance companies,\n i.e. in the clear text, to, better supply for the same amount of money. That has grown historically.\n That's why we have so many health insurance companies, because it has developed over many years.\n For example, it used to be that large companies had their own health insurance companies for their employees.\n You still know BKK. There are not many anymore, but BKK VW is still there, for example.\n There were many hundreds, of course,KKVW, for example, still exists. And there were many hundreds, which are of course increasingly shrunk,\n because even from a certain number of employees, such a health insurance is simply not financed.\n In this respect, a considerable shrinking process has already taken place.\n I would also think that it would probably be even less.\n But I don't know if you should wish that there is a unit insurance.\n From the insurance point of view, I think it's better if there are several,\n who then also have the opportunity to put themselves under pressure from each other to get the best out of the supply chain.\n It doesn't have to be a disadvantage for insurers.\n Anti-citizens insurance?\n I think the citizens insurance, in my personal opinion, will never come. It wouldn't come if the SPD had the absolute majority because it is hardly feasible in that which is often forgotten, the public insurance does not change anything at all.\n Because Sven still insures infants privately today. That means, until that really works, I'm probably not living anymore and you're in retirement age.\n So that's not what changes anything at all. I see it relatively emotionless. In countries where there is public insurance, doctors earn better. That's something you have to know.\n That surprised me too. We analyzed it.\n The discussion that comes every few years is like a dead man.\n Whenever there is a election, there is a public insurance.\n And we found that in all countries with state health systems, the private share of people paying from their pockets is much higher than with us. But what I personally would consider to be useful, I would actually, with the health insurance,\n an analog, maybe a little bit to the Kfz insurance, I would take the private ones with me.\n Then you would have the argument actually\n that you have to offer such a compulsory insurance range to a comparable tariff,\n in my opinion also without health check-up. And then you can put your ideas on it\n and you can buy them or not.\n If someone says I want to insure myself against falcons and want to insure Botox, I can do that.\n But it can't be the task of the solidarity community.\n So I think you can make a competition and then the boundaries would be a little bit washed away.\n And two-class society in terms of medicine?\n No, I don't think there is. There is a very simple example. If I operate and I do two cross-stitches, one is private and the other is legal insured, the operation is exactly the same.\n But the price is not.\n The price is unfortunately almost the same."

I told you earlier that we always negotiate our point value every year and everyone says it doesn't increase enough, but it does every year.\n And with the private health insurance, the last tax adjustment was in 1996.\n Now you can easily imagine that with inflation is clean, it gets less and less.\n And that's why the benefit of private patients against the legal insured is no longer really great.\n There is a lot of criticism that politics allows homeopathy to be paid by the health insurance companies.\n In the end, that's magic.\n Yes.\n And hocus pocus. What do you think about that?\n Basically I think there has to be freedom of therapy. If there are patients and doctors who agree that homeopathy is a great thing, they can do it.\n The patient can pay for it himself.\n Exactly. What doesn't work is that the lawful health insurance companies pay. Why doesn't not possible? You could say it doesn't cost that much money. The discussion is also, the Greens also took it from their agenda at the time because it is a very bitterly\n conducted discussion. The reason is relatively banal. We have a way of treating\n legal insured patients in Germany, that is, they will be,\n through the joint federal committee, the ICWIC for example and the ECOTIC,\n these are the institutes that select the quality, that select the studies, is the treatment useful, is it effective, is the medication effective and is it safe, very important.\n If that is the case, it will be included in the performance catalog.\n That means that every legal insured knows that the treatment he receives is definitely safe and it works.\n Possibly he will only get it with one or two years delay because this processing takes so long.\n And only these services that have gone through this test procedure are financed.\n In homeopathy there are no reasonable studies at all.\n The homeopaths say there are, of course, but there are actually no real ones.\n In this respect, it is not actually understandable that I make a shortcut there, so to speak,\n because they think it's so great, we replace it. And here I demand a hard scientific evidence. So if they can provide the evidence\n for homeopathy, wonderful. Can you file a request? Do we check that? If that is given,\n can we pass it? As long as that is not the case, it should not be passed, in my opinion.\n Have you ever had a patient who said, give me something homeopathic?\n Well, that's not so much in demand with orthopedics.\n But there are of course people who say, I still take devil's claws and what is the cuckoo without wanting to evaluate devil's claws good or bad?\n What do you think of plant things, green lip mussels or what is the cuckoo?\n That is of course asked, but we usually describe it in terms of the scope.\n That's why homeopathy is not such a huge topic for us.\n Let's stay with the money and come to Corona. There is a lot of criticism from you that you have sold out a supply of supplies for the Corona vaccination. I looked it up. If a doctor does a flu vaccination,\n he gets 8 euros. With measles vaccination between 57 and 16 euros.\n That's poorly subsidized.\n That's poorly subsidized. And last year you got 20 euros, then it went up to 28.

Now, as a representative of interest of the doctors, I have no problem with acting out a high allowance in doubt.\n Although you have to say that the allowance now sounds high or higher at first. The effort is actually not trivial either.\n And we have counter-calculated that. You just said the allowance of the colleagues who work in the\n vaccination center. That's just part of the calculation. Overall, the vaccination centers\n had costs per vaccination of between 150 and 200, due to the enormous effort they make, had costs per vaccination of between 150 and 200 euros. On the other hand, an vaccination for 20 euros in\n practice is of course a special offer, you just have to say that. And I actually had colleagues,\n I would say the vaccination is with 20, 28 euros, does that fit anywhere? But I have many\n letters from colleagues who say how stupid I am to pay such a low allowance.\n And there were demands that were absurdly high in my view.\n So I think the 28 euros are actually appropriate and I say that without getting red.\n I think that is appropriate for the effort and the performance.\n But is the effort four to five times greater than with a flu vaccination or a measles vaccination? We actually vaccinated in practice, of course not as much as the house doctors and the effort was considerable.\n Four to five times?\n Yes, it's more. The documentation effort is really incredible.\n And that's actually different from vaccination. Usually when you get vaccinated, you enter the vaccination number in the system, you give the injection, the person becomes well-educated, you have the anamnesis from them, so far so good.\n And then the thing is done. With Corona we had to, because the vaccines were very new, nobody knew that then they had to be consulted, then we had to do all the nonsense twice, once for the patient, once for us.\n And at the same time we had to enter a report to the RKI manually, which patient was vaccinated with which vaccine, so that they could do these vaccination surveys.\n So the effort was actually enormous. We did that afterwards on days when we did nothing else, because the rest of the practice was no longer possible. We had two employees at the front, they took the patients in, two filled out the forms with them, we vaccinated them in the back and then they had to sit there for follow-up.\n I think the compensation is okay, the 28 euros, but it's not like you can say, they don't just make themselves stupid, but also stupid. I don't think that's right.\n But how did you manage to get 20 euros for a shot last year and now up to 36 euros?\n Negotiated.\n How do you do that?\n Well, I think what politics actually noticed, that was actually a tough discussion.\n It was initially the problem that we only had the vaccination in the vaccination centers. That was also because the vaccine was so extremely scarce that people were simply worried that the vaccination centers would be stormed.\n Of course, everyone wanted to have the vaccination. The vaccination was there, the promise of salvation.\n And the vaccine was super scarce.\n And then they started in the vaccination centers and then at some point they realized that it was just too much work, too much effort.\n Many people do it, but with enormous effort.\n I also got the first vaccination at the vaccination centre. That was in the stadium in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n Of course, because football wasn't allowed to be played, so I got vaccinated."

            "reference_answer": "Andreas Gassen, the Chairman of the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung, justifies the increase in compensation for Corona vaccinations for doctors from 20 euros to up to 36 euros by citing the significant documentation effort required for each vaccination. He explains that the documentation effort for Corona vaccinations is much greater than for flu or measles vaccinations due to the need for consultation, manual reporting to the RKI, and documentation for each patient. He also mentions that the effort was so significant that it required two employees at the front to take patients in, fill out forms, and two doctors to vaccinate and provide follow-up care. He believes that the compensation is appropriate for the effort and performance, but acknowledges that it may not seem high at first glance due to the enormous effort required. He also mentions that the compensation was negotiated with politics due to the initial scarcity of the vaccine and the realization that the effort required was too great for the initial compensation.",

That was in the stadium in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n Of course, because football wasn't allowed to be played, so I got vaccinated.\n That was remarkable, like at a rock concert, the drive to the place, to the people and so on.\n And that's of course in practice, despite all the effort, much slimmer.\n And when the vaccination was made available, the question was, do we give it to the hospitals as well as the vaccination centers?\n There were many who said, we'll leave it in the vaccination centers. It was a heated discussion.\n And I actually conducted a two-hour conversation with Frau Merkel about it and documented it on the basis of numbers that we are actually simply creating more vaccines.\n At the end of the day, that was the question, how quickly do we get as many people vaccinated as possible. And the figures have documented this very\n sustainably, that we have No one knows the information and is even more informed. The people are well known in the hospitals.\n We had 90,000 hospitals that had been vaccinated.\n So very close to the people.\n And it just worked better.\n In that respect, I think that was good and right.\n And then we saw that the vaccination centers\n can't just not be as efficient,\n but that they are much more expensive.\n And I think that was the decisive point.\n We said, come on, we'd rather put a few euros on it to get some boost into the booster campaign.\n But in the end it's not about the health insurance companies paying for it, but the tax payer.\n Half of it, for example, the federal government.\n And then it's a bit surprising when a doctor in Saxony goes to a vaccination center and gets 175 euros per hour.\n You can calculate that, if he works 40 hours a week, he earns 28,000 euros per month.\n If he would do that in practice, he would earn about 65,000 euros in normal business.\n That is a misuse of course, logically.\n Ah, then you might have to...\n No, vaccination is very important.\n It's because you're milking our\u2026\n That's the vaccination fund that we're not trading, but the countries offered it to us.\n The vaccination centers were run by the countries.\n But you're trading these prices with the countries.\n No, not necessarily.\n The Kassener Erzgevereinigung is trading this with the countries? No, not necessarily. The Kassener Erzgevereinigung\n negotiates this with the respective federal states. They did that in part. You have to know the following,\n vaccination is basically not part of the legal health insurance. Neither are these other\n vaccinations. Vaccination is not part of the daily business. It is always negotiated separately.\n And in fact, the vaccination fees are negotiated in national agreements for the flu, measles, and measles vaccination.\n We negotiated the Corona vaccination, the 20 and 28 euros you mentioned, for the first time in the federal government.\n For the vaccination in the hospitals. But we did not negotiate the vaccination fees in the vaccination centers.\n Because the vaccination centers were operated by the countries, the municipalities, whoever.\n Did your health insurance association do that in Saxony?\n Some of them did that. I can't say exactly which association did what.\n Some of them were also offers of the vaccination centers to get people, because of course they have to have people who are vaccinated.\n But the problem is, in addition to this apparently melting of our system, while at the same time our nurses have to look around how they get around the corner and have and wait for a care bonus.\n I find that also strange.\n Come on, go to a hospital in the vaccination center, can earn up to 30,000 euros a month.\n Well, that's a theoretical value."

However, it was soon realized that administering vaccines in vaccination centers required enormous effort and was less efficient compared to hospitals. This led to a heated discussion among politicians about whether to continue with vaccination centers or expand to hospitals. The Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung (German Medical Association) played a role in this decision by conducting a two-hour conversation with Chancellor Angela Merkel and presenting numbers that showed creating more vaccines would be more effective in getting as many people vaccinated as possible. The figures also showed that hospitals were better equipped to administer vaccines due to their proximity to the people and their efficiency. The Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung negotiated the vaccination fees for hospitals with the federal government, but not for vaccination centers, which were operated by the countries or municipalities. Some health insurance associations in Saxony negotiated vaccination fees with vaccination centers to get people vaccinated.

But the costs are good.\n That means he can not only earn no money in his practice, but he has to be an incentive for the vaccination.\n But if we talk about money, we have a size where you can sit down. In the last month alone in the Nordrhein, over 200 million euros have been calculated for these citizen tests.\n For citizen tests that in 7 out of 10 cases are no longer able to detect Omicron at all.\n If you calculate that, we come to the conclusion that ...\n We criticize our work here. That's completely crazy. In this respect you have one point, that with this whole Corona topic, you quickly put money into the system, not always targeted.\n And I'm completely with you. I find the discussion about the health bonus,\n just like the discussion about the Corona bonus for the MFA, almost disproving.\n It comes down to this, you're swimming in money, you've traded a lot of money, the politicians are throwing it at you and the nurses and the old nurses have to hope that they don't get a burnout and that they get a few euros.\n No, that's right. The nursing home is not a new phenomenon. It was difficult when I was in the clinic.\n The question is where is your solidarity? You could also say half is enough, give the money you would give us to the nurses.\n So the nurses who worked in the vaccination centers have also taken a lot of action.\n But now you say you have taken action.\n So 175 euros an hour is not bad, but I know of nurses who get between 40 and 70 euros an hour.\n That's not so bad either. So therefore, I think it's too short-spoken to say that\n the doctors, everyone who worked in the vaccination center, has good money for the\n student aid workers, they got 30, 35 euros. And now you can ask the question,\n is that reasonably allocated? Basically no, the vaccination center was of course much too expensive.\n Therefore it was also a matter of course that in the practice labs. Another discussion is,\n how do I deal with nursing staff, how do I deal with MFAs. If I am full-mouthed and\n that's what politicians have done, yes, there is a nursing bonus and it doesn't come, then I find\n that weak. And certainly, I'm with you, it would make sense to take a few marks\n and say, watch out, they won't tell you much, there's a bonus X. Now you can\n see how it is justified. Of course, it is not always justified when I have an intensive care nurse\n who really does ECMO treatment and I have a nurse in the hospital who maybe has few or no corona patients and both get the same bonus.\n You would also ask yourself, is that still fair? So basically I'm both.\n And the care bonus that is now being discussed, you go to the vaccination center for four hours, then you have it out. You have it out.

I had studied before that affected my subject and now I have to study about virus loads, about test procedures.\n That's exciting, I wouldn't have let myself dream.\n And in that respect, yes, I have read a lot.\n I still wouldn't assume that I am a virologist. Not everything, but a lot. I'm not a virologist.\n You can get into it, but I don't have to understand the virological or the vaccine-based, but I have to know how to interpret numbers.\n How did you come to that? March 2020, almost two years ago, you once said that Covid-19 is more of a medical-related infection.\n Would you say that again today?\n I think that at the time the statement was basically correct.\n As I said, we had 823 cases in Germany and the news was full of it.\n Interestingly, I was in China at the beginning of January when it broke out in Wuhan.\n In China you didn't hear anything. Nothing. No word.\n I called from Germany and said, what's going on in China with this lung disease?\n Lung disease here in China? We know nothing. And we were with a medical delegation.\n So then we come back and we had a meeting at that time when when we asked ourselves how we would deal with this Corona topic.\n Nobody knew what was waiting for us.\n In the meeting in the Ministry of Health, the question was what we could do.\n We also agreed with the RKI at that time.\n We tried to regulate certain things, because we had no experience with the pandemic and no one in charge of it. And at that time, everyone was really lamenting about it.\n And they told me, if you look at the numbers,\n it's not like we have a huge number of infected people at the moment.\n It's actually, and in that respect it may sound a bit flabby,\n but it was actually like that when you looked at the media coverage.\n And what really happened medically at that time,\n then it was a considerable discrepancy.\n So you don't just do statements on a daily basis?\n That was on a daily basis at that time.\n And I want to see who said, I know what it looks like.\n I think we all have a good idea of what happened and how long it happened and how we deal with it.\n But that's exactly the point.

And that's just reality. The virus\n doesn't go away anymore. Because there are coronaviruses similar to influenza viruses. The\n last ones here, SARS, MERS, are coronaviruses. The Spanish ones were influenza, swine flu,\n chicken flu.

Omicron is super contagious and, thank God, does not make you sick.\n We have an vaccine.\n So the conditions of course are actually so far that you say that the light at the end of the tunnel is actually relatively clear and it is not a train that comes towards us.\n But I still find the basic statement right.\n What was done from that, I also found that we were deliberately misunderstood.\n So to speak, it doesn't matter if it's completely useless.

That means, what I'm carrying out is not what I'm thinking in the morning, but is of course counter-proven.\n A with experts, and these are experts who are in parts in the expert council of the federal government, so they will have some idea.\n And of course they are counter-proven with experts that we have, that we have with things we have with the APDA. And that is being condensed and we are not pretending.\n That's the case with everyone who expresses himself politically.\n These are all not experts.\n So in this respect, yes, I have the political mandate for the KBV to act politically.\n And that actually started initially when we started here with the first\n Corona cases to deal with the issue of care. How can the health care doctors, many have\n reported to us, defend themselves against you spreading nonsense in the name of the health care doctor in Germany\n from their point of view? Yes, that is exactly the opposite. I actually, and that's a lot of\n letters, that's of course clear, those who complain don't write more. With certainty\n it will be a lot of colleagues who say, I see it differently, that's also legitimate and say,\n how can he say that? That's why it's still the way it is. And just as many colleagues write to me\n and say, finally someone who can also illuminate it from the perspective of the colleagues.\n So I think there is, and that's the whole thing.\n More people have reported to me who are not cool.\n Logically, they reported to you who didn't like it and wrote to me.\n There is no truth in Corona.\n And that's what's a bit of a shame overall.\n And we wouldn't have expected that when the paper was open.\n We actually thought that this is a discussion basis and you can try to find the best solution there. A little underestimated\n maybe that you had already set yourself politically so that it should not be questioned at all.\n And that's what Tim Werber, for example, from Mr. Wieler in the Federal Press, said.\n The measures, and I mean that's a sentence you have to get used to, the measures\n should not be questioned.\n And then we're back to where we were before.\n I think in a scientific discourse you always have to question everything.\n That is the essence of science, that nothing is given first.\n And I found it undemocratic.\n And that's something I'm having a hard time with.\n And I think you have to question that now. Then you can realize that you are right or wrong.\n Or we both have wrongs and we have to find something else.\n And that is, one might excuse everything, but in this heat of the discussion it didn't really happen.\n And it's also undemocratic to be intransoud or dishonest. Your position paper October 2020 was called\n Position paper of science and medicine for strategy adjustment in dealing with the pandemic.\n Yes.\n That was then, it turned out to be wrong, because you neither brought out this paper in the name of science nor medicine.\n So I would give you the right to say that the title was imprecise and that it would have been better chosen differently,\n but of course scientists,'t have to do that.\n Most of the universities have opposed that their name should be in the name list.\n No, that's not quite right. I know what you're talking about.\n The professors of the anesthesiologist department didn't want to have anything to do with it.\n You've been fooled by the wrong people.\n That's not correct. I'll tell you why it's not correct.\n When this paper was made, we said,\n okay, if we make such a paper, it would of course be\n useful to see how the colleagues think about it.\n And then we asked these associations.\n Specifically, this was the Spitzmann specialist.\n The Spitzmann specialist has a board that consists of five people.\n And the board of the Spitzmann specialist looked at the paper and said,\n yes, we'll take that with us.

You're painting a picture of the doctors as if the cashier should be a police officer. No, that's not true.

I didn't take it seriously that someone had the idea.\n But what was actually the suggestion and it has been communicated several times by state ministers and also in some first proposals for vaccination,\n that a compulsory consultation on vaccination is required, which the doctors, Ms. Giffey, I think also said in Berlin, that the vaccination is compulsory for every medical exam.\n And that is already an agreement of the contract doctors and I speak for the contract doctors and they said And they said, and this was actually a united position with all the KVs,\n we do not want to implement measures that are taken under the umbrella of an vaccination policy for the public health care system.\n We vaccinate anyone who wants to get vaccinated. But we do not do compulsory counseling or compulsory counseling.\n But that's something different than you said at the beginning of the year.\n At BILD you said, quote, we will not encourage our doctors to execute a vaccination against the will of the patient.\n Execute. That's a straw man.\n That can't be encouraged. You are doctors. You are not allowed to do anything against the will of the patient.\n Why do you say that?\n Because that was actually part of this vaccination discussion and that wouldn't have meant forced vaccination.\n But it would have meant, Minister Laumann in North Rhine-Westphalia, Ms. Giffey here in Berlin,\n that we would require compulsory consultation in the contract hospitals.\n And that is a task, a compensation of the contract doctor, which is not allowed and which we do not want.\n That's a different argument than what you brought up, that it's like executing the vaccination policy.\n Well, that's the word, you can pull yourself up now.

He says, easing must be linked to pandemic,\n not to temporal data. When we talk about opening steps, we should\n link them to indicators of the health system, for example hospitalization rates, free beds,\n personnel resources. The calendar does not matter to the virus. Is he right?\n In principle, he is right. I actually said that at another point today.\n You can now determine the relaxation at the date, it's just not in the legal framework.\n But surely it would be smarter to say we are relaxing.\n Under the condition that, for example, I would actually capriciate it on the intensive care unit,\n a certain value is not exceeded.\n That certainly makes sense internally.\n The hospitalization is difficult because we have a lot of people who are not because of it, but with Corona.\n But that you link a medical parameter to it is fundamentally correct.\n So, then the complex that was actually discussed the most, interestingly,\n is the question of why there is no more cash seats for psychotherapists?\n The question was asked by half a dozen people.\n Okay. So we are, in my understanding, the only country that provides psychotherapy through the legal insurance company. That is actually a special feature.\n And we have 29,000 approved psychotherapists in Germany. That is a value that is not\n available anywhere else."

That would have to come through contributions or taxes.\n So ultimately it is a question of money. But I have to say objectively, the number of psychotherapists and the way they are subsidized and also accessible to everyone is relatively unique.\n Nevertheless, the question was also, will you as the head of the Kassen\u00e4rztlichen Bundesvereinigung take the responsibility for increasing the number of psychotherapeutic places will increase.\n Of course we represent the psychotherapeutic colleagues and we will demand that\n but at the same time we have to link this demand with the appropriate financing.\n I don't need anything if I tell my colleague, you can leave me alone, I just don't have a fee for you.\n We have to combine this with a statement from the cash register,\n that these additional places will be financed for the long term.\n And then we do everything to achieve that.\n In this context, Cool Happy 1995 reminds of a quote that probably comes from you.\n Just have a beer when you have mental problems.\n No, that's not from me.\n Ah.\n That's not from me, I would never say that.\n The quote was said by Josef Hecken, the chairman of the Federal Council, once said a bit flippantly, he didn't really say it, but I know that he probably wouldn't say it like that today, but that's not from me, I put it on.\n And you don't do it on your own?\n No, I don't do it on my own. What should universities do to make the training of doctors cheaper and to help them to reduce the lack of doctors?\n I don't know if it's better to make it cheaper. Medicine is always more expensive than many other scientific studies.\n Everything that has to do with lab spaces is expensive. We would of course have to increase the number of medical students,\n because the demand is simply increasing.\n And we also experience that many who do a medical graduation\n do not go directly into the care.\n So we lose even more.\n So we actually need more study spaces.\n Again the same questioner.\n Is the claim that a medical study costs 200,000 euros, if yes, true?\n What are the costs?\n I think it's realistic. I've seen numbers, I don't know how current they are,\n that depending on the degree, it's between 80 and 250,000 euros,\n so engineering, chemistry is similar expensive, I think, or biology.\n It's because over a period of six years the teachers have to be there,\n you have to have the space and in all natural sciences ...\n So for all courses."

You can maybe do virtual things in parts, but medicine is a subject where you have to touch and do things.\n That's why I don't know how high the potential of the cost is.

Zuley asks, wouldn't it be an advantage if every medical student had to do a\n nursing education for two years before graduation as a requirement for admission and then\n who would get which place of study is decided by test and not by NC?\n So basically, whether the NC is the ideal parameter, you can certainly put a big question mark behind it.\n That those with the best graduation are the best doctors, that's probably more coincidental than a law.\n The training places that we need for the care, so to speak, to use for people who then go to a study, I don't think that's a good thing.\n That you do a care practice is already the case so far.

He also suggests that requiring medical students to complete a nursing education for two years before graduation may not be an effective solution, as it would block training places for those who want to learn the profession.

Yes, that's a problem. That's what we have in\n medicine, of course, quite extreme. But we don't just have it in the area of doctors,\n but we also have it, obviously, with the nurses.

That's not a bad idea. There are some, not only as employees,\n but also dependance practices.\n A practice from Berlin says\n we have four or five colleagues\n and one drives once a week\n to the periphery, to Brandenburg or somewhere else.\n What's important is that when you do that\n and when you try to\n bundle this medical competence\n into these centers,\n it still results in often long journeys for the people.\n But we actually get more offers in the field.\n Tjul asks why, I can only assume that what is being claimed is true,\n I can't check, you have to correct if it's not true.\n Tjul asks why general practitioners earn more than highly specialized doctors, such as cardiologists or\n eye doctors, who have to buy much more expensive devices. Is that so?\n So you have to differentiate between sales and earnings. The sales are definitely higher\n in the operative sectors, but of course also the costs. In fact,\n we are now constantly making this observation that\n the house doctors have now significantly increased and are now lying above several specialist groups,\n for example conservative eye doctors, dermatologists.\n Was that the case before? Did the house doctors actually earn less?\n But there has been a significant gain in the ground, so that the house doctors are now moving in the middle segment.\n Yes, because the thesis was that general practitioners earn more than specialists.\n So is that currently the case or do you say no?\n You can say that, it really depends on the field.\n The dentists are well positioned in terms of earnings.\n Andreas Stein, no, yes, Andreas Stein,\n is interested in digitalizing\n to use the doctors for an optimized workload of doctors.\n Especially the timing of the delivery and so on binds resources and could help overloaded doctors if it happened digitally automated.\n Yes, that would be good. We are also trying to develop it. It is not completely trivial.\n We have seen in many digitalization programs that they do not really work well.

And we have experienced this in the past, that it has already happened in many groups, that some corporations take the complete value chain from the industrial product to the patient in this way.\n That's difficult and not what we want. We actually still have the idea that an independently managed, in-house managed medical practice is best suited to the people who are medically\n healthy, at least for you, who is the right one.\n David K.: Why do doctors vaccinate better than pharmacists?\n Dr. If they vaccinate better, that depends on whether you reduce vaccination to the peaks.\n That may sometimes be a matter of luck, whether the patient is relaxed.\n But it is important that vaccination is more important be done to vaccinate than to put the syringe in the arm. You have to estimate whether this individual person who is vaccinated has a possible health risk,\n which may also be relevant for a corona vaccination. We know about thrombosis risks.\n There was this discussion with AstraZeneca a year ago. All these things can actually only be judged by medical reasoning.\n Even if it is very rare, we see a safety advantage. Heinrich asks, since you are against the vaccination obligation, can you imagine introducing an vaccination obligation as a preliminary decision,\n so that if a new variant comes next autumn with great interest, that you then have an instrument?\n So I think that vaccinating is still very useful, I can only recommend it to everyone.\n The vaccination obligation must be practical.\n And whether you make a preliminary decision, which you could discuss if situations change extremely, you can talk about it.\n Ultimately, this is a political decision.

I saw it as young and naive. Amen. I should point out to our fans who liked more impulsive, unsubstantial interview partners that you should try something.\n That I should become more unsubstantial?\n Yes.\n I will try.\n Let's start. We don't have as much time as last time.\n We now have a new government.\n The GroKo is in place.\n The media has often heard that the world is waiting for Germany to have a government again.\n Who exactly has been waiting for us in the world?\n Many of our European partners.\n To be precise, the governments in other EU countries have certainly waited for it and also a number of commentators and journalists and political decision-makers,\n that initiatives are also taking place from the largest country in the EU and that the largest country in the EU is not only governed by business.\n In the past it has often been the case that it has been said, it has been claimed, that everyone would be careful that something happens in France.\n Now France has a new president with a comfortable majority in parliament since the last years.\n And he starts a whole series of initiatives, real kind, material kind, rhetorical kind.\n And is waiting for Germany to participate, to take initiatives, to keep the language of the picture, start the locomotive.\n But the whole world is waiting for Germany.\n Well, you wouldn't have heard that from me.\n But yes, there are of course partners, other governments waiting for it.\n There are certainly also partners outside of other governments waiting for it, that to become an initiative with a government that not only manages business.\n Take a case like the one we just experienced over the weekend.\n The president of the USA says,\n Trade wars are easy to win.\n It is easy to win a There are probably some politicians from the USA, maybe even members of Trump's\n own party, who want clear words from Berlin, a major trade nation.\n Have you already taken them?\n So far, I'm not holding back here. Those who have expressed themselves are those who are also\n formally responsible for trade policy, namely the members of the European Commission.\n Are you afraid of a trade war? I mean, the Americans can probably win every military confrontation in the world with anyone. Can they win every trade war. And the difference to military confrontations, which of course are primarily tried to avoid,\n is that Trump obviously thinks, President Trump, to be more practical,\n that President Trump obviously thinks a trade war is something that one also leads against allies.\n Obviously. a trade war is something that you also lead against allies.\n Obviously.\n Not quite obviously.

He emphasizes that trade is not a zero-sum game and that consumers make purchasing decisions based on their preferences rather than trade surpluses.

Perthes also notes that Trump's stance on trade may not be an isolated incident, but rather an accentuation of broader trends in US foreign policy. He believes that the US under Obama recognized the need for cooperation with other countries on global issues and that Trump's stance ignores this reality, potentially making the US smaller in the global arena.",

There are the alliances, there is the influence, but imperial I would no longer call it,\n because my concept of imperial also includes that the emperor can then actually\n decide for himself what is going on and the USA has not been able to do that for a long time.\n Although the US president has more free hand in foreign policy than the chancellor.\n Yes, that's right, also as the chancellor.\n But he can't decide what's going on in the world.\n He has more prerogatives, similar to a French president,\n regarding the design of foreign policy or the use of his army.\n But just because the French president has stronger prerogatives than the chancellor, you wouldn't say France is still an empire today.\n You didn't use foreign words.\n Prerogatives, the foreword.\n And the French have, unlike the Americans...\n You used the word empire, by the way.\n That's right.\n Reich.\n World Reich. The US has over 200 US military states.\n In Basel or in Germany.\n Last year I read on The Intercept that the US used US special forces in 131 countries.\n There are some countries where they are, but they are not used.\n So it does have a bit of a world-politic tendency.\n The attempt to be a world-politic is certainly there.\n There are also states that wish that the USA as a world-politic,\n or at least as a politician in their specific region.\n We even see that, in brackets, there are commentators who said that with Trump the USA withdraws from world politics or something like that,\n but that's not the case. We even see that the USA has increased their military presence in the first year by Donald Trump\n in some places and intensified it.\n And that is the important point for me, where the USA must react on it\n and the allies of the USA must talk about it with the USA.\n The USA can no longer decide what happens in the world.\n Even if they have military presence somewhere why they can control the events.

Just keep China small or bend? If you look at Trump's new US security strategy,\n then the growing rivalry with China is certainly a very important motif.\n China is called a revisionist power,\n a power that wants to change the existing world conditions,\n and it wants to provide unity.\n If I were to say, but I don't define the American interests,\n if you ask me what are the American interests,\n I would say as good cooperation as possible\n with the growing, stronger China\n and all other nations in Asia.\n And that we are not being denied in the USA,\n that trade exchange with China,\n trade exchange, cooperation with other countries in the region,\n in the continent, is very important.\n But today we have an international situation,\n which makes it so complex.\n This gives us work,\n that countries are no longer just friends or enemies,\n but that they are often together.\n You cooperate in many questions and you,\n now I use an American word,\n you also hedge against each other,\n so you build fences to protect yourself.\n You take precautions to protect yourself,\n to be on guard against each other.\n I understand that. Why is China perceived as a threat, but not India?\n One could say that because India is representing itself as a friend of the USA and China as a rival.\n In all the defects that one may find there, India is a democracy, a democratic system. That means there is an ideological component,\n feels closer to the western government model,\n although there are legal differences, but that would be another discussion.\n China is an authoritarian one-party system,\n does not fit at all, so to speak, to the American or western model.\n And of course there are very concrete geopolitical rivalries,\n which might even exist if we have similar forms of government.\n Who controls the freedom of the seaways in the South Chinese Sea?\n Who says or who controls, who determines what happens in Korea? Are there threats, fears of American allies who are positioned in China's strategic environment?\n South Korea, Japan, yes, there are definitely. What does the president or the communist leadership mean when the office time limitation is abolished by the president?\n First of all I would like to say that the American president doesn't take an example of this.\n Maybe it just shows the difference between the American model and the American model, which has certain checks and balances.\n It's not just a democratic system, but it's also a right-wing system.\n Maybe that's why Donald Trump is so involved with justice.\n But it's a right-wing system, it's a system that controls those who are\n equipped with power on time. Checks and balances.\n We have that in China, obviously less and less.\n We have never had it to that extent,\n like in the USA or like in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n But the abolishment of a fixed office time\n or a maximum office time of a president\n of course puts such checks out of force.\n So you're approaching the German system.\n Because a chancellor can also be reelected indefinitely.\n In that case you could say that.\n Although you say that,\n now you have to be in the camera with a certain smirk,\n that we have already elected chancellors.\n Or fell from their own party.\n Or both in combination.

So it is correct that China has invested very intensively in Greece.\n For example ports.\n Then you can ask, why don't the Europeans do that themselves?\n Or if the Europeans force Greece to privatize infrastructure urgently,\n then they should not be surprised that the Chinese might intervene.\n But that's what it is, you could have done it differently.\n Afterwards you are always smart.\n But it is true that China, if it buys large, important infrastructure\n via state-owned companies or state-owned companies,\n so that it seems to pursue not only economic goals, but also political ones.\n So a certain influence, or that a certain political well-being is expected.\n And yes, China is very active, also in other Eastern and Central European countries,\n not least also in Hungary.\n So, you already mentioned Korea, I wanted to come back to it anyway,\n explain to us how we can achieve peace there.\n I mean, I'm not talking about reunification.\n Reunion is not the same as peace.\n The most important thing is that there is no war.\n That the conflict between North Korea and the USA is relaxed.\n The nuclear weapons developed by North Korea do not need to be used for the possible confrontation with South Korea.\n Nuclear weapons are not necessarily used on their own small peninsula.\n Even in a war between North and South Korea one could imagine\n that it is more used with traditional conventional weapons.\n Developing North Koreans develop, test,\n show that they have something like that, or will soon have,\n wide-ranging rockets,\n intercontinental rockets and atomic bomb heads\n that can be mounted on such intercontinental rockets.\n You can only think of the USA with that.\n That means we could, in the course of this year or next year,\n get into a situation in the course of this year or next year,\n where the US, the leadership of the US, is facing the choice of either accepting that they are potentially threatened by a North Korean nuclear-powered rocket\n or waging war to prevent this from happening, or that something happens that President Trump said would never happen.\n You may remember, at the beginning of his term he said,\n it will not happen.\n And what he meant by that is that there could be a North Korean rocket\n with a nuclear bomb that could reach the USA.\n But why should the North Koreans do that?\n So if the North Koreans attack the US, North Korea will no longer exist.\n So that's the most illogical variant of all from the point of view of non-experts.\n Yes, that's the case.

First, you don't want to increase the number of potential opponents, of course. Who wants that? Secondly, you accept North Korea as not playing in the same league\n as Russia and China. And thirdly, there are the questions in the\n USA, as others ask themselves, whether we are actually dealing with a rational\n actor in North Korea or not.\n You don't ask yourself that in the USA.\n It is, thank God, not quite as it is in the movies,\n that the American president always has this suitcase with him,\n where he would really just open the suitcase and press the button.\n German media before Trump's election played exactly that scenario.\n Yes, that's why I say it's not quite like any media journalist might imagine.\n It's not directly fake news, it's right that there's the suitcase with the code.\n And it's right that the American president makes the final decision.\n But there's a decision chain where others participate.\n And the head of the nuclear command finally even at a conference\n in canada explained and said well it's not that easy there are still advisory\n lines and decision-making lines through which such a decision is made but the last\n decision the president is right the americans have an interest in Korean peace?\n I mean, because of the constant war or weapon-shield situation, you can keep the Koreans up to date.

Third, it avoids the potential for a reunification process that could disrupt the current political order and potentially lead to instability or conflict.\nHowever, if the status quo is disrupted through Korean reunification, several potential problems could arise. For example, the question of whether a reunified Korea would possess nuclear weapons could create tension between the United States and China. Additionally, the possibility of an overhaul of North Korea by South Korea could result in the United States having allies directly on the Chinese border, which would not be in China's interest. Conversely, an overhaul of South Korea by North Korea would not be welcomed by many South Koreans.

However, he acknowledges that this is not a long-term solution due to the limited progress and the length of time it would take. He also mentions the concerns of Afghan partners who fear the negative consequences of an international withdrawal. Despite this, Perthes emphasizes that the international community, including Germany, is part of an alliance with the United States and wants them to uphold their obligations in NATO. He believes that the international community's continued involvement in Afghanistan is driven by this alliance and the desire to ensure the Americans remain committed to their obligations towards Europe. Perthes also touches upon the concept of European and German responsibility, but he does not explicitly define it in the context of the query.",

In a world where everyone fights against everyone,\n where there are no united nations, with all the deficits that the united nations have,\n where Europe does not grow together, but falls back into the national statehood of the early 20th century.\n We certainly are not getting better and we will not be safer from it.\n But when we talk about this more responsibility and you say we think we actually find more political, diplomatic solutions with it.\n Why do we send more and more soldiers to more and more conflict areas?\n We try to answer militarily.\n First of all, we don't send more and more soldiers to more and more conflict areas.\n Many Bundeswehr units are never in front.\n The number of soldiers in foreign units has decreased or stagnated. have been taken away or stagged.\n At least they haven't grown up.\n But that's not the core of your question.\n My answer would be to say, we have a, and that's a good thing,\n a political culture that says,\n other means of state art than the military\n are the ones we would first and foremost use.\n So diplomatic solutions are always what you have to try first.\n And I think a very good example where we also practice this is the dealing with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict\n or the conflict in East Ukraine.\n This is one of the examples where there were differences with the Obama administration in the USA,\n whether we do it right, whether it is right that\n Chancellor Merkel and her Germanic and now French colleagues,\n so then Hollande and now Macron,\n here on the path of top diplomacy together with poroshenko and putin try to\n at least to stop the conflicts at least once yes this normandy format is the right thing\n or if you are not like some american senators said you just deliver weapons\n to the ukraine so that they can defend themselves yes we had a different approach we have\n partly also a different approach than the French, who say much faster\n if we have a problem, let's see if it's not also the military solution."
