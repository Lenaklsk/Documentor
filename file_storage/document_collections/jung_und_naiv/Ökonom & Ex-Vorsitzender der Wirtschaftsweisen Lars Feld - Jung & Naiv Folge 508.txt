 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
 So, a new episode of Jung Naiv. We are in the studio and I have a new guest. Who are you?
 Lars Feld.
 What are you doing, Lars?
 I am a professor of business policy at the University of Freiburg, director of the Walter Eucken Institute.
 And I am and have been active in various advisory functions, last in the Board of Directors for Economy.
 That the General Assembly is called the Board of Directors for Economy. You were even the head now.
 I was even the chairman last year
 of my ten-year membership.
 Is it always like that, that you are the head last year?
 No, the chairman is elected by the members of the Board of Directors
 and they elected me last year.
 But there are only five members, so there is a five-rounder, right?
 Yes, there is a five-rounder.
 The law has also determined that the members of their committee elect a chairman or a chairman.
 How did you convince them?
 Oh, I was for a long time ...
 Did you still have a election campaign?
 No, I didn't need to.
 I was in it for a long time and was responsible for the finance policy, which always means that if you know what is happening in the finance policy, that the European political issues, the social political issues, they all have a place in it.
 That means I did a lot of the core business of the board of directors and then the members also decided for me.
 Is the economic way actually the Olymp for the German economists? Or as a German economist?
 If you got there, did you make it?
 You can't say that. You have to clearly notice that in my field, in the economics, there is a strong research orientation. It has always existed, but it has become increasingly important with the internationalisation of the last 20-30 years,
 so that the actual Olympus is the Nobel Prize and not the economic need? On the one hand, there are councils in Europe in different countries that have been founded
 partly according to the role model of the board of directors, for example in Denmark. In
 France it is different, this board is also exchanged with each government change.
 In smaller countries this did not happen, but with the provision, I think it is from the
 six-pack regulation,
 to introduce a so-called fiscal council to monitor financial policy,
 some countries took the opportunity and then founded a board with a broader mandate,
 similar to the council of secretaries. So for example Spain did that.
 But does it need something like that?
 Could there be such a council for the European economy with a German, a Spaniard, an Italian in Greece?
 That could be possible and we also have a European fiscal council that has specifically assessed the financial policy of the member states at the EU is a strange structure. It is not a federal state, it has a statehood not in the narrow sense.
 It is a construct between federal state and state federation. The Federal Constitutional Court always says state federation to somehow understand that.
 And therefore it is of course a bit more difficult. Whether such a board needs it, I find it useful. But that's no wonder, I was a member. But still, if you made your report, it didn't necessarily have an impact.
 So theoretically, all governments could always say, Lars, thanks for your advice, but we choose to ignore it.
 Yes, basically every government can say that, but they can't completely ignore it. It is also stated in the law that in the annual economic report, which will come three or four months later,
 actually January 2.5, the federal government must take reference to the annual report of the board of directors, in whatever form.
 In any case, this means that employees in the ministries responsible for economic policy at least have to have read parts of the report.
 But to whom do you always hand it over? To Merkel or to Altmaier?
 No, to the chancellor.
 She doesn't read it, does she?
 I don't think so.
 Why is it handed over?
 Well, because it's a press conference and an act that always takes place.
 But is it a deception of the public?
 No.
 The chancellor doesn't read it.
 The chancellor doesn't read it, but her employees read it, have lunch with the Chancellor and the cabinet,
 to then discuss the annual report with some distance and peace
 and to discuss the upcoming challenges in the spring for the year that is then in progress.
 Was there also lunch during the pandemic?
 No, not during the pandemic.
 This year a video conference took place.
 Last year we did the video conference a little later,
 because the pandemic hit the mark in March. hit right in march but in the years before that was the case what is there to eat
 also different yes so she cooks or one she has a kitchen that prepares that in the
 chancellor's office no no no that is in the chancellor's office with parts of the cabinet and it is
 then every time that the kitchen of the Chancellor's Office is in charge of us.
 But you can't say that the ministers who are always there, they are there for this round and they are also there for the transfer of the annual report, that they wouldn't read it.
 We once asked Wolfgang Schäuble whether his employees had brought him him our suggestions for finance and European policy.
 Then he looked up in his typical rough way and said,
 like the employees, I read that myself.
 The business ministers you experienced in your position,
 Brüderle, Rösler, Altmaier, Gabriel, who was the best? Or who was the most accepted?
 I can't say that. All four. If you look closely at the responsibilities of the Ministry of Economy,
 you have the task of distributing subsidies in normal times.
 You are also responsible for competition policy and you have the basic department,
 where you always keep the orderly flag up.
 But if you look closely, the Ministry of Finance,
 which addresses economic policy deviations, is important.
 Yes, I know, but the Ministry of Finance is more important for economic policy in general.
 Because if you want to make economic policy effective, you need money.
 And the Ministry of Finance sets the main cornerstones here.
 Does the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy need it?
 I found the Ministry of Economy and Labour under Wolfgang Klemens to be very objective.
 One must not forget the Ministry of Labour. The BMAS is responsible for the largest part of the federal budget and is responsible for the labour market and the important social policies.
 You have to keep that in mind. These are essential parts of the economic policy, which are not usually included in the Ministry of Economy, if you don't have a super ministry.
 Maybe the division is not that bad. The Ministry of Labor takes over the interests of the workers,
 the Ministry of Finance, the interests of the employers.
 Altmaier said on Friday,
 I represent the interests of the economy.
 Well, the interests of the economy,
 I always try to differentiate and say,
 I'm concerned with the entire economy,
 not the employers or the employers.
 Or are they special interest groups?
 I've always tried,
 well, the economy of the people is an old-fashioned name,
 in the past it was called national economy, it is also a strange name,
 and that's why you say better economy, if you say it in German,
 but it's about the whole German economy and European economy.
 So now you're no longer an economist, what's the Nobel Prize for?
 It doesn't really exist, right? It's just called that. If you take it more precisely, it's a prize from the Swedish Nationalbank, the Swedish Riksbank, that's what it's called.
 But it's so well-known that it's now accepted as a Nobel Prize.
 What does it look like? Do you have any chances?
 No, I've gone very decisively towards economic policy, then you simply don't have the time to do research to the extent
 and also to do basic research, that you would have a chance at the Nobel Prize.
 Then you have to see on the other side, without a background at an American university,
 it is very difficult to get the Nobel Prize.
 Well, the American universities offer so many free spaces for research, are always
 at the forefront and thus offer completely different opportunities to develop.
 That sounds like a job for European universities and also German ones.
 Yes, basically it is already so. It is always a bit time. Then the excellence initiative came out,
 with which we tried to achieve more excellence in different sciences.
 And the German research landscape is not bad either.
 You can't say that in any other way.
 But in the sciences we certainly have further need for recruitment compared to the USA.
 Where did you study?
 I studied in Saarbrücken at the University of Saarland and then I graduated in St.Gallen, which is basically also included in the study, the promotion study, so to speak.
 You're from the Saarland, you come from the Saarland.
 Yes, I come from the Saarland.
 Where did you grow up?
 Near Saarbrücken, I was born in Saarbrücken.
 Next to Oskar Lafontaine, right?
 You can't say next to him, but Oskar Laontein actually comes from the area around Saarlouis.
 I don't know it that well.
 Okay, geographically, that's the border to Luxembourg, towards Trier.
 Everyone knows everyone, right?
 It is true that in this small town of Saarland, with less than one million inhabitants, you can very quickly find a known person.
 Do you know Oskar? I met him, I was once a member of the SPD and
 was on state party days and similar and also met Oskar Laffenthen.
 How did you get into the SPD? I come from a traditional
 SPD family. My great-grandfather was a founding member of the SPD in Saarland,
 was a mayor of a community before the Second World War for a short time,
 was removed from this office after the conclusion of the Saarland in 1935 after the vote,
 but then took up this job again after the Second World War, for a certain time, even during the French administration, until the Saarland returned to the Federal Republic
 and he remained mayor until the beginning of the 1970s.
 And there are many sequels with other relatives in the next generation,
 for example with Alwin Brück, who died a year ago,
 only a former parliamentary secretary of state in the Ministry of Development, as it was called then.
 Why did you join?
 Yes, it was this familiar bond and at that time there was the NATO double decision and I was very peaceful and then found it the right decision.
 I did love to move to the Greens at that time, but the family had a great influence on me and brought me closer to the SPD.
 Then I would have left at some point.
 When?
 When I came back from Switzerland.
 I came back from Switzerland in 2002,
 when I took the professorship at Marburg.
 I looked at it for half a year and was out in 2003.
 But that was the time when the super minister was angry.
 That was exactly your thing, wasn't it?
 It didn't work out for me at the time.
 I was still younger, maybe a bit more radical in terms of economic policy than I am today.
 Agenda 2010 wasn't...
 Wasn't far enough for me, exactly.
 But above all, regarding the background of the Social Democrats, I basically expected that the SPD wouldn't succeed in getting away from the proximity of the unions so that they would not go back again.
 And that's what they've done now.
 What was the problem with the unions?
 Well, in my opinion, we had already in the years before, with a large tariff bond in Germany,
 so until the 80s, the beginning of the 90s, basically an implicit minimum wage due to what the tariff contracts agreed. And that has led to unemployment, especially in the lower wage area,
 and has led to the fact that the unemployed with low qualifications hardly ever got into jobs.
 And that is, in my opinion, the wrong way. But where was the Angle F 2010, to be specific,
 not radical enough? Where would you say we would have done more consistently?
 I would have done more with the labour market regulation. We have, in view of
 various elements of the prohibition of protection, received opening legislation,
 if you think of lay-off work, temporary work, for example, there were facilitations and the like.
 But it was only minor things. In essence, the German prohibition of protection of rights is still relatively restrictive and we can be happy,
 unlike Italy, for example, that our workability decides these cases
 quickly and the employers know quickly what they are.
 Did you wish for a stronger Hire and Fire mentality?
 I wouldn't say that.
 That the employers can fire their employees faster and set them up?
 Hire and Fire is the American system.
 What I have foreseen are the Flex Security models
 as we have them in Switzerland and Denmark.
 Also two very different systems if you look at it from a social and political point of view.
 There you have a very flexible working situation and therefore a higher insurance for those who become unemployed.
 What would that mean if that had happened in Germany? Give us an example.
 Basically, you would have to get as insurance would be higher for unemployed people.
 So not 67% or 60%, if you are unmarried, of the last salary you earned and the last salary, but higher have become more expensive and on the other hand, there is a clear flexibility in the contractual regulations. In Switzerland, you typically have a term of termination of three or six months.
 Have you ever been terminated?
 No, never. I have never been terminated. I have always had small jobs during my studies, but as a student you are always only employed as a minor and retirement is not really an issue.
 And on the other hand, if you are then employed in public service at some point, you are not threatened by retirement.
 Have you never been unemployed?
 No, never.
 Do you have to be that to know the situation of unemployed people or is that not a factor in economic science? I think it is generally not a factor that you have to have been in a situation to
 analyze these situations or these framework conditions and
 find out what is reasonable or not. That would be even nicer if everyone had
 everything through first in order to make sensible decisions afterwards.
 That applies to politics as well.
 Yes, there is always the accusation that he hasn't worked a day, that he has been sitting in his seat since he was in the Bundestag.
 I think that's wrong. I always like to oppose those who always raise their voices against the economy.
 You should think a little more carefully about what the principle of working division means.
 Someone who is a professional politician and is able to get to the top has certain advantages to do politics compared to others.
 Tell me, how did you grow up? What did your parents do?
 My father was a credit officer at a bank in Saarbrücken. No, that was the former Röchling Bank, which was then taken over by the Bavarian Association Bank and then by the Hypo Association Bank, which is now at Unicredit.
 So that's the story of this bank.
 He worked there first as a credit officer and then also developed further and was responsible for the development of insurances and the like.
 Bank clerk-like.
 Exactly, he was a bank clerk. My mother was a secretary and housewife. Or is it? I mean, she's now in retirement.
 I don't know if Hans-Werner Sinn told you, but I was impressed that he was the first in his whole family who was able to do his Abitur. Was that something special for you? Because I assume that you did your Abitur.
 Sure, I did my Abitur in a neighboring community in Illingen. But I can't say that my high school was completely different.
 My father's brother, my uncle, had studied and was a senior student council member in Sauerland.
 So that was when I was younger and experienced it.
 I also partly prepared for my high school.
 He was a history teacher and I had a history performance course.
 That was very cheap. Were you a good student? It was good, for my high school. He was a history teacher and I had a history course. That was very cheap.
 Were you a good student?
 It was good, but not very good.
 Course in history?
 German and English.
 You had three courses?
 We had three courses in German, English, history and the oral exam in math.
 There was no economics or something?
 No.
 We had.
 Would that have been necessary back then?
 Oh, I don't know. We had a completely different time back then.
 You know, I'm in my sixties, so I graduated in 1985 and there was no differentiation to that extent.
 So we already had the first computer science classes at our school back then. And looking back at the experience of my children at different locations,
 I have to say that it was a fairly progressive school.
 I think that the economy would have been introduced a little earlier if they had been brought closer to it.
 But that's where the economic high schools and the like were founded in Saarland.
 What is active as a student? Student representation or student newspaper?
 I was editor-in-chief of a student newspaper, exactly.
 So in the final phase of my school time
 and was otherwise also there in the school
 really active and just have it.
 So I think that's how it actually is
 belongs, that's why I regret at the moment
 those who are under Corona
 don't have this kind of life.
 I just tried to let it go in the last few years.
 What does that mean?
 I had a good time.
 Was it too much that the police came? Or is it not in Saarland?
 It's definitely coming to Saarland, but it wasn't that violent there yet.
 Especially because the neighbourhoods weren't so sensitive and then called the police.
 That's different today.
 Really?
 I have the impression that something has changed in the time.
 When there is a peace crisis, the police call the neighbourhoods and stand there with their fingers raised.
 But if the youth celebrate with you in neighbourhood celebrate today, then you're liberal.
 I'm liberal, I have to be,
 because when my children had a break
 at our home in Freiburg,
 they celebrated properly
 and we got calls back and forth
 when we were on holiday or something.
 And did you know before graduating
 or with an apprenticeship
 that you wanted to work in the economy?
 Not at all.
 I had the opportunity to cancel the military service due to the fact that I had a lot of parties at the time.
 I just didn't take care of it and was called in.
 However, only relatively late, not until July 1st after graduation, but October 1st with 15 months of military service.
 And I also graduated those 15 months, so I went to university relatively late.
 I graduated those 15 months because I was out earlier, you could have saved up for vacation and after 12 who will ask your questions at the end of the interview.
 He went in, refused in the beginning and left a few months later.
 I don't know if I didn't have the courage to do that or for whatever reason.
 You swore to refuse. Why did you want to refuse?
 I was in the early 80s, peaceful and then I left.
 Was it? You're not anymore?
 Today I say that my opposition to NATO's double decision was a mistake. I wouldn't do that anymore.
 We can discuss that later.
 Gladly.
 Yes, and of course that's also in the course of getting older.
 Early 80s, when you're going to high school and other priorities are are set, such things also come into the background.
 That can happen and that's how it was with me.
 Then the letter came from the district defense agency and you fell from all the clouds?
 I actually still had the hope that I might even be incompatible, but then I had to go to the Bundeswehr.
 I went there and it was on the other hand also a location that was relatively relaxed. I was stationed in Daunen in the Eifel.
 There are remote reporting battalions and we listened to Ostblock back then. That means
 we had shift services, difficult shift services, a different shift every day and
 both the Soviets in the GDR and the NVA were fired.
 Guess what my uncle and my father did?
 They were fan reporters on the other side.
 Yes.
 Very funny.
 Explain, what did fan reporters do? How did you work?
 Well, I was in the company that heard radio speeches on the one hand and language messages, and the voice messages on the other.
 Were they not encrypted?
 They were encrypted and the encryption was done by an intelligence department.
 But how did they catch it?
 Well, it was old technology in the of the device and you wrote it down.
 What you heard, you wrote it down.
 And did you have something useful in all those months?
 Where you were like, boss, Mr. Feldbläbel, I have something.
 You can't say that like that, because it's coded.
 That means you typically have...
 You were never interested in what was being decoded?
 No. You have to imagine that you have sentences that are being decoded and they are organized in five groups, so five letters each.
 And one letter has different characters. So these five letters are being morphed and then you write them down, these from each other, these five combinations.
 And they have to be decoded afterwards.
 And the same thing is done with the speech and writing radio.
 We had a special company that was based on Russian,
 in order to listen to the radio specifically.
 We just searched and checked and then tried to find out if it was Russian.
 So that means we had to at least know a few words in Russian and then passed it on to the colleagues.
 Was it a nice time in the background?
 No.
 Why?
 I thought it was boring, to be honest.
 I don't know how it was with you, but the first three months of basic training were still fun.
 After that they put me in the library, it was similar to you.
 Yes, basic training was also not fun at all.
 The first two weeks with some kind of violent march and not wearing shoes in autumn through the Eifel, where it can be really cold,
 it wasn't that nice.
 And then it was ...
 The remote controllers are always a bit lo relaxed than parachute jumpers because of me.
 That means you come with injured feet to the doctor in the sanitary area and there it is relatively fast with the remote controllers.
 At least that was the case with us back then.
 That means I didn't have to take part in any things for a. I didn't really take part in the basic training.
 I can't see well, I can't shoot well, it's not fun at all.
 So I will certainly never become a hunter.
 All of that was uninteresting.
 But you didn't do a few days of hunting in the forest in winter?
 I took part in one of these exercises in elementary school.
 And afterwards I was in bed for several weeks because of a severe flu.
 And from that a nasal septal cavity inflammation developed, which I had operated on in the Bundeswehr hospitals, in Koblenz and so on.
 What did you get bored of at the Bundeswehr?
 Did you come up with the idea of doing economics?
 Not yet.
 No, not yet.
 What's going on with you?
 When did you wake up? On the one hand, I have also been involved very quickly.
 And that happened to me. That means Iwehr period, again three and a half months,
 but at that time I also gradually switched from psychiatry to psychiatry.
 And then, in the sense of working time reduction,
 a shorter working week was introduced,
 so that this clinic needed student assistants at the weekend,
 considered over the whole year.
 And then I started working there, always so that you stayed minimally employed, I was looking at student aid workers over the whole year.
 And then I started working there, always so that you stayed minimally employed,
 which always has an impact on the social security obligation and the tax.
 That means I worked three weekends a month and had one free and three weekends
 then it was already open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Saturday and and Sundays,
 so 12 hours of work with an hour break,
 which we did back then.
 And yes, at first I had the idea,
 I might apply for medicine.
 And then I signed up,
 because the idea of studying medicine
 has come back into the background,
 because somehow this time in psychiatry and psychiatry has also scared me a bit.
 So scared away from my medical studies.
 And so I am ...
 Why?
 Yes.
 Can you see me well?
 Yes, yes, that was not a problem at all a lot of people who go into medical school with very strong ideas of what you can do for people.
 And I had the impression that it was difficult. psychiatric diseases and I was in a closed department for a long time as a caretaker, improvement will be difficult to achieve in many, many cases.
 And in geriatrics, that is clear, that is part of internal medicine. For older people,
 it is often about dying and then making it easier for people who die. But that was of course not cheap for the beginning of a hopeful medicine.
 And so I let the idea go again. Maybe I was just too lazy and didn't want to take it all on me. I don't know anymore.
 It was also a time when I also celebrated properly.
 And then...
 As often as you said you celebrated.
 Yes, that was less afterwards.
 And then I enrolled in political science at the University of Saarland for a semester.
 I wanted to do a master's degree in politics, English and German literature.
 On the one hand, I was a bit disappointed by these two sub-faculty courses,
 but in political science you had to do a VWL certificate,
 Introduction to the Faculty of Economics, that was part of it.
 And I wanted to bring that right at the beginning.
 I went in there and it inspired me,
 and then I switched to the winter semester 87-88 in the VWL.
 We'll get to the inspiration in a moment, but just briefly, caretaker.
 What exactly did you do there?
 Well, what you have to do in the care in the hospital, especially if it is acute.
 Like today's nurses work?
 Exactly.
 Of course, as a caretaker, for insurance reasons, you don't have the opportunity to do everything that nurses do.
 Although you have to admit that the 80s were a little different.
 The idea came up that certain applications, such as blood intake, infusions, syring injections, should no longer be done by the nursing staff,
 but only by the medical staff. But that only came to light. That means there were best trained,
 examined nurses and caretakers who had of course done this for their whole lives and
 of course they continued to do so. But these were activities that I wasn't allowed to do. Other things, washing patients,
 laying beds for patients, cleaning such things.
 Did you have time to talk to them?
 Yes, of course.
 That's the big thing about the current nurses a lack of social closeness.
 I experienced this in a certain way cyclically.
 In the Geliathria it was quite the case that there were phases in which the stations I was in were completely overloaded and phases in which you could rest quite a bit.
 Overloaded because you were too few or too many? Because it is different. There were of course weeks when there were a lot of new entrances.
 So you had new patients and had to have sick beds on the floor because of the overload.
 There were definitely.
 Really?
 And then on the other hand,
 there were also rest phases,
 in which very little happened.
 Or, you mention it,
 there was a subsistence.
 That there were simply cases of illness
 and no one at your disposal.
 That you then tried to use
 another student aid or something like that.
 And that is of course not always that easy.
 In psychiatry, the cycle has been a
 bit worse i was on a closed men's ward as a nurse and there were
 very, very quiet times the there were the rooms not even fully occupied and yes patients patients
 with whom then on a closed one just couldn't walk that much in therapy because they were
 simply in their acute phase then above treated medically and had medical discussions.
 And then there was little to do for the nursing staff.
 And then on the other hand a complete overload.
 Closed men always meant that there was a risk that violence would break out.
 Have you experienced that?
 I've experienced that, yes. On your own body?
 On my own body you can't say that. I wasn't overrun in that sense.
 That suggests the question a bit. Not that you think so, but the listeners could misunderstand it.
 But did you experience violence?
 Yes, of course.
 The snakes around you?
 Exactly. Then you had to see what you were doing. So if it was someone who just did it to be able to break out of the closed one, then we sure that the colleagues who remained in the office called the police.
 Such people were no longer outside for a long time.
 You said there was also a deadlock. Nowadays, or even in my time, when you were bored, you got your cell phone out, surfed,
 spent your time watching Netflix and YouTube and so on. What did you do in the 80s? That didn't exist at all.
 That means the nursing staff sat together in a room of residence,
 talked to each other, went through the station a bit,
 talked to the patients as far as possible.
 I sometimes found it a bit boring on such weekends.
 What I did then, I cleaned up everywhere.
 So the medicine cabinet and everything else.
 Did you have a case record?
 No.
 Did you need it back then?
 I'm a bit of a backer of the case records,
 to find them good or bad.
 In both directions.
 I think that in the health care industry
 you have to see that the funds are not always available,
 that there is a budget and therefore a budget restriction that has to be kept in some form.
 At that time I also had the impression that there were many violations at the stations,
 that we had patients on the Geliathria who were not really sick,
 but were still admitted because the relatives wanted to go on vacation and the like.
 So that was definitely there at the time.
 What?
 Yes.
 Those were also such elements where you get to know the health care system a little differently and the social care system a little differently.
 Relatives want to go on vacation and then send grandma to the station.
 Yes, exactly.
 We want to go on vacation and then send grandma to the station. Exactly.
 But the false reports, other countries have also introduced that, Australia and a few other western countries, all have managed it. We are the last ones who still have it.
 Yes, exactly. I think that we have to think about something else in the health care system in order to set the right incentives.
 We have parallel in the current health care system over, under and malnutrition. And that shouldn't
 actually exist. Over, under and malnutrition?
 So, over-sufficiency, take a look, we are leading in the OECD countries in
 cardiac catheters, for example. And I mean, so much ...
 It's definitely well calculated, right?
 It's well calculated. And you have to say, we are not so much more sick with
 cardiovascular diseases now. A little bit. You can still see that we are not so much more sick with cardiovascular diseases now.
 You can see that we still have a little higher risk of smoking and drinking and eating well compared to other OECD countries, but that doesn't matter that much.
 Or for example hip joints, that's exactly the same. We also have a very clear over-supply.
 And we also have under-supply, we have already mentioned that if the care staff is not enough at the stations to cope with the peaks of the load.
 At intensive care stations, we regularly have a very high load on staff.
 And what I have just mentioned with over- and mis-supply, it is done hand in hand. And we also have, for example, what concerns the structure of the clinics,
 some very small clinics that can no longer perform the performance
 because they have too few cases of illness in certain areas.
 For example, a concentration like in Denmark.
 That means?
 Greater units that are then set up at such locations
 that the distances to these larger unit are not so large.
 So for example for stroke cases.
 If a small clinic somewhere in, I like to take Baden-Württemberg, in the Swabian Alps or something,
 a small clinic has few stroke cases, then the stroke units that have to be used there are less likely to do what is necessary than in a large clinic where you have to treat 10-15 cases of this kind every day.
 I come from Maekpom, for example, where all the hospitals slowly go down the stream and my parents would have to drive 60 kilometers to Neubrandenburg to get to a proper clinic, is that not a problem either?
 If 60 kilometers are already a problem, I don't dare to judge.
 But it's about emergencies.
 Exactly, you have to ensure emergency care.
 I mean, there is a fire department in every city.
 Why is there at least a small hospital in every small German city?
 So at least for emergency care, there must be appropriate units
 so that you can be there quickly.
 I have deliberately mentioned this example of a stroke, where you have to react very quickly and then can see pretty good results in the healing.
 If you wait too long, then you have a problem. What about the private clinics in Germany?
 They make billions of profits,
 basically withdraw the money from the German health system.
 Yes, the health system consists of many things
 and the incentive for profit is very cheap at various points.
 Should there be any incentive for profit in a health system?
 In a health system and in a market-based system you need the incentive.
 The important thing is that we get innovations through the incentive.
 This is less common in hospitals, but in the pharmaceutical industry it is an important point.
 If you think about it, we have been discussing the necessity of industrial policy for a few years.
 Mr. Altmaier was here recently, he made a suggestion
 about industrial policy two years ago, which I myself criticized very sharply.
 Digitalization and climate protection are always at the forefront. The most important innovation
 of the last year is the development of drugs, i.e. a vaccine that has been developed.
 And that also on a gene-based basis. And we have not been friendly to
 gene technology in the last decades.
 I am just wondering which innovations private clinics have produced in Germany in recent years.
 It is certainly a process innovation that must be taken into account.
 And what we now also have in the health sector, that in the course of digitization and automation,
 for example, it is discussed for which treatments you can use, for example, operation robots.
 But if private clinics are in the health system, then there is a profit thinking.
 They want to make money. Can you make money with it on sick people and the health system?
 Sure.
 But we could say as a society that we don't want that.
 You could also say that it's not good.
 The market should stand out.
 There should be no market.
 You shouldn't make a profit with health care.
 That's too much for me.
 So the question of profit is not the key point.
 Because we ultimately want a good supply to come about. And when we look at the purely state systems, we always have certain forms of rationing that we have always rejected in Germany.
 So, for example, which operations are carried out beyond the age of 80.
 We have that in the British NHS, for example.
 Not in the Swedish.
 We don't have it in the Swedish.
 Not in the Dutch either.
 The Dutch system is different.
 There is always this state system, it is always called Great Britain, but Sweden forgets it.
 No, I don't forget it.
 There are good state health systems and not so good.
 Yes, but even in Denmark we have certain restrictions that apply to the treatment of older patients.
 So you have to ask yourself more precisely, when you look at the other systems,
 are all the elements that exist for these systems something that we want to have in Germany?
 And we didn't want that so far.
 I think it's right to ask, especially in the health sector, where the market failure is in there.
 And we should correct that from the state side.
 So, for example, as far as insurance is concerned, I think that health insurance companies have to work with a very tight state corset,
 no matter whether they are now legally or privately organized.
 Because we have a whole range of problems that can occur otherwise. So that is, so to speak, from the
 financing side. And on the other hand, there are different treatments that
 would not be carried out if the state did not provide this in its hospitals,
 for example for rare diseases. Also What we do in the field of basic research and medicine anyway,
 is not possible without state intervention.
 But that does not mean that private providers could not allow private providers
 for certain areas to allow private providers for profit orientation or profit aspirations.
 We have done that accordingly.
 Well, profit and profit is one thing, profit maximization is the other. And private clinics,
 you can assume that as a shareholder, you have to do that.
 Well, you ...
 Isn't that harmful to the health system?
 The basic principle is always to maximize profit under restrictions. And then it comes
 down to the restrictions. The orientation to want to get as much profit as possible. Yes,
 I don't want to tell everyone that they are
 maximizers of profit, but you drive better if you do that.
 But you do that in companies, right?
 I think it's better to tell everyone that they are maximizers of profit.
 But now we're talking about big companies. Helios and Co.
 Yes, it doesn't matter if you take big companies or small companies or private
 people. You are, if you try to set rules for an economic system
 or in general rules for a state and a society,
 on the safe side, if you assume that people
 would act the way you fear they would act,
 then you have robust rules.
 If you have to trust it...
 So, expect the worst and hope for the best.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 You don't have to hope for the best, but you can try to set the rules and the framework so that you get a relatively good result.
 Then the question is, if the private clinics in Germany still make billions of euros, are the rules not strict enough?
 They could maybe make 100,000 euros, for my sake.
 Or a million, but if they make billions...
 But Thilo, the question of the amount of profit is not relevant for that.
 But the money has to be somewhere...
 They have to have earned it somewhere.
 Yes.
 So if billions are missing in the health care system and that is being spent on the shareholders...
 Then there is obviously a willingness to pay for it. The question is always, if we have such a system, is it actually also the willingness to pay
 for the people who can express themselves in a reasonable way?
 Or is there market power or something like that that can lead to exploitation of the crime?
 So a system in which we would exploit the state organization of the health care system is bad.
 But we have already briefly discussed it.
 I then look at the health care system and ask where the inefficiencies are.
 And I find that we have over and under malnutrition next to each other and then ask how we can correct that.
 Exploiting was a good keyword. The nurses in Germany feel exploited.
 Can you understand that? You were one yourself.
 Yes, I was just a nurse.
 You can feel more into it than I can.
 I can feel into it, yes.
 And my wife is a doctor who has worked in clinics for a long time in Germany and Switzerland.
 Exploitation is too far for me.
 I wouldn't say that. We have exploitation in other contexts, but not there.
 Is there exploitation in Germany?
 Well, if I look at what there is about black work, illegal employment, there is also exploitation in a large scale, of course.
 I'm thinking of the foreign harvesters or people in meat factories and so on.
 The fact that you call them farmers shows that we have put a view from the outside and that many in agriculture cannot really afford to exploit them.
 The question of exploitation is always how you fix it. I always make exploitation based on the fact that people do something they wouldn't normally do if the employer didn't have the pressure. from mostly workers, rare workers, but also workers,
 from outside, because we don't have enough workers who do these hard jobs.
 And they are ready to do that.
 The hard workers get relatively a lot of money compared to what they would otherwise earn.
 Maybe you should just pay more money so that Germans think,
 okay, it was a hard job, but good money.
 This results in, so to speak, on its own. We have already seen last year how difficult it was
 to get the staff in the pandemic. But you can also see in the time frame before the pandemic,
 in the years of 1918, that it has become increasingly difficult to get a
 herder. In the meat industry, the problem is a little bit different.
 I know some companies in the meat industry that don't have the problems that Tönnies has.
 You just mentioned the insurance, the civil insurance. What do you think about it?
 What the SPD, the Greens, and probably the left-wing want?
 So to put it roughly, the abolishment of the dual system, private and legal.
 Yes, there are two different paths. On the one hand the financing side and on the other hand the question of whether we organize this privately or do we do it purely state-owned.
 We could also imagine private companies and you pay a certain amount at the level of your income.
 So not only interest rates, but also income.
 And that is the civil insurance, unlike the current financing of the legal health insurance.
 And the separation of state and private is in a way also a bit more differentiated to judge.
 You have to know that the far largest part of the private insurance is the civil servants.
 Maybe they should pay the same system as the majority.
 Yes, but it is a confusion between state and private, especially when it is state-employed in the private insurance.
 I have to say, I like the system, the Swiss one, much better. In the Swiss system you have private insurance, no legal insurance. You pay premiums, that is, rather head-to-head, as it to income differences in car insurance.
 And on the other hand, more than half, almost 60% of the Swiss population,
 receives subsidies from the general state household through so-called premiums.
 That means you don't have a purely private system,
 but the state pays relatively a lot to the insured themselves.
 But the insured then have the opportunity to use different modules in their private system, but the state pays a relatively large amount to the insured themselves, but the insured then have the opportunity to take in their private insurance
 various modules of the supply or to leave out. And thus
 also to provide certain incentives for the health system via the insurance.
 Did you also think about the economic ways? Was that a topic at all?
 Yes, of course. That was already a topic topic before I came to the Council of Representatives.
 And then there was Rürup, who has spread various proposals and we have continued to implement them and supported them.
 Let's go back. You ended up at a university. You attended the national economy course and then there was the Heureka moment.
 Heureka is too much. I just thought it was great.
 Why?
 I mean, I also went there and found it terrible.
 Really?
 Yes.
 Now I would ask you back why.
 So I could ask now.
 You can ask me in your podcast.
 You ask the questions, I know.
 So I can't really say that.
 So on the one hand, in microeconomics I found it incredibly interesting
 how a market result is achieved. How to work out the easiest way to learn it in the VWL.
 Request side on one side, offer side on the other side and at some point there is a balance and that determines the price.
 And then you can work with it and see what changes there are depending on what problems exist on the market.
 Possibly a state attack or market power
 or market failure and the like. I found that fascinating and when we then
 entered the macroeconomic part, I found it even more fascinating because it is about
 major economic and political issues. I am from Saarland, grew up in Saarland at the time.
 You have to see, in the early 80s, after the second oil price shock, there was a sharp structural change in the area of coal and steel in Saarland.
 We had a relatively high unemployment in Saarland.
 So the question was, how do you fight unemployment?
 An important topos that also moved me to study at VWL.
 Then you studied, did you have any famous professors? Did you have any idols in your studies?
 Yes, absolutely.
 On the one hand, you can't study at VWL in Saarbrücken anymore.
 They have stopped the course a few years ago.
 BWL is still possible and the BWL's people there are working on it. But the Saarbrücken school of VWL was relatively
 well known over the years. They started with names like Herbert Giersch, Egon Sohmen,
 back then in the discussion about fixed flexible exchange courses, important sizes, Wolfgang Stützel,
 who was also very strong in the discussion, Giersch and Stützel both in the board of directors, Giersch even founding member.
 Never heard of him.
 Yes, that was in the 60s, so to speak. Herbert Giersch was later president of the Institute for
 World Affairs in Kiel, one of the great presidents who has taken on a lot of influence,
 has developed a whole school with different professors who have played a role in Germany for a long time.
 School?
 A private school, yes.
 What was that school? with different professors who played a role in Germany for a long time. School? A private school, yes.
 What kind of school was that?
 The Gierschschule, which brought forth professors like Olaf Sievert, who taught in Saarbrücken with us.
 One of the people I directors for a long time,
 who had three years of office,
 so 15 years and worked as a chairman of ten of them.
 Or Jürgen Donges from Cologne,
 Gerhard Fels also from Cologne,
 from the younger Karl-Heinz Parquet, who is still a term today.
 And they were all men before?
 They were all men, it was strongly dominated by men, that has to be said clearly.
 Whereas in Saarbrücken there was also a professor in the past, Elisabeth Liefmann Keil,
 whom I have not experienced anymore, who was a Euken student and on the other hand
 the founding president of the European Public Choice Society and I later became president of this society.
 So there was also a line.
 But the actual idol of my studies was Werner Pommerene.
 I don't know him.
 He unfortunately died of a heart attack at the age of 50,
 when I was just a fresh assistant at his school.
 What was he like? That fascinated me.
 Werner Pommerene is a student of Bruno Frey,
 although they weren't very much apart in terms of age. This was because
 Bruno became Professor and Constance very early, namely I think at the age of 27 or 28. And
 Bruno Frei founded the Freischule with many professors, just like that in the German-speaking
 room, some still in office and would today. And he basically had the political economy on the one hand, popularized the political economy, which was called political economy back then, in the German-speaking area.
 His students were also very, very strong in these areas. I found that fascinating. This combination of VWL and political science, the interface between political science and economics, I found very fascinating.
 And Werner Pommerene was just an extremely strong man in research. He worked day and night, had many risk factors for the heart attack he later got.
 Did you read Adam Smith, Keynes, Marx at the university?
 Only later.
 So I did a dogma-historical course at the end of my studies with Rudolf Richter.
 There we read Marx, Carl Menger, Smith, Ricardo, Böhm-Barberg and others, then a number of younger
 authors.
 I thought that was quite nice, but that I then read the
 The Wealth of Nations completely and later Theory of Moral Sentiments
 and so on, that actually came first in my doctoral studies.
 That was capital?
 Not completely, just parts of it.
 And?
 That didn't fascinate me.
 Did he have a right to do that? Or did he keep his right? Marx?
 That's a difficult question.
 He described capitalism at the time.
 Yes, but that's a difficult question. Because the question we always asked ourselves, or the one I asked myself early on,
 why didn't this Marxist prognosis of communism, this historical determinism that is in there, doesn't work.
 What was the reason for that?
 So the other question is, where did he get the injustice?
 Well, his way out was, okay, we have to get away from it.
 But he described capitalism in itself, and that seems to be still in line with the big picture today.
 What you draw from it and which keys he drew, you don't have to discuss that now. Yes, but surely that is wrong in the analysis, what is called the labor value theory.
 Price and value come about as Karl Menger and others developed it from that time,
 namely by driving the willingness to pay, so to speak, the last marginal unit gives the balance.
 But did he have a right to do that? Well, that there are always crises in capitalism, yes.
 He was right about that, but that was taken up by authors like John Maynard Keynes and others in a different way.
 So I think what Marx underestimated was the ability of the respective societies to react to these challenges
 and then also to show ways to better them.
 But the crises are still coming.
 Absolutely, but we are going around differently today.
 We have managed to control the financial crisis in many countries, at least not in all,
 but in many countries that were strongly affected by it through expansive were able to counteract it through expansive finance and monetary policy
 without having to deal with mass unemployment.
 And we let the perpetrators run away?
 Not really. Look at what happened in the USA.
 There were some who didn't just want to end their lives.
 Can you count how many bankers ended up in jail?
 It's not always that easy with the jail. But if billions and billions of worth are destroyed, people lose their property and
 property and no one is responsible for it.
 But you know, one thing is, is there a fraud or not?
 If I can determine a fraud and then there are also criminal consequences.
 If it is not a fraud, but simply a mistake that you commit,
 a wrong decision that is made, that happens again and again.
 And I think that you also have to recognize this possibility of error.
 So not as excited about Marx?
 No, I'm not. I mean, when I was a student in the upper class,
 I tried to understand the Mao Bible and I didn't find that very understandable.
 Neither Marx nor Mao.
 We talked to your professors about our economic system.
 Did they also use the CDU slogan, social market economy?
 Or did you talk about capitalism?
 Yes, of course the word capitalism has fallen and social market economy.
 That's not a bad word. the word capitalism and market economy, social market economy, but basically it was
 very pragmatic, especially in the study of Munzer-Brücken, to get to know as much as possible.
 At Olaf Sievert, you had to handle huge literature lists in the teaching events
 and read an incredible amount and then really see different assumptions.
 So the development of Keynesianism over the Monetarism, the different positions that took place in macroeconomics, were brought very close to one another.
 And similarly in the more microeconomic events, when it came to market failure.
 We learned a lot from him. Basically, you had to visit his teaching events several times until you understood everything.
 It wasn't enough to go there once. I was there three times in total until I dared to visit the administration several times until I understood everything. It wasn't enough to go there once.
 I went there three times in total until I dared to take the exam.
 Is it still the case that professors think of new ways of thinking today?
 There is the direction of the plural economy, there is MMT,
 so many new things are coming to you, economic professors?
 There are always challenges coming to us, but MMT is everything but new.
 So that's what's happening in 1944 at Eberlörner in a very similar way.
 So it's not new at all and just poured a new coat of paint into the discussion.
 And it's not very theoretical anyway.
 And it's not a money-theoretical event, but a fiscal-political one.
 Now you have to explain briefly to our audience what it is about.
 So with Eber Lörner, who called the whole thing functional finance, it was about
 fully focusing on the goal of full employment after the Second World War.
 And to do everything for that. And then all other political areas had to stand back,
 was his idea, and only offer support. So both the labor market policy and the money policy should only offer support.
 And that means, essentially, that the money policy is responsible for the state's budget restrictions,
 by printing money and ensuring that this budget restriction is not too strong. And this idea is exactly the same as that of MMT.
 But unlike MMT, Eberleurner did not claim that this was a theory of money,
 but he said right away that this was a financial theory.
 And in this respect, the first M is wrong, it is not modern, but old.
 The second M is wrong, it is not modern, but old. The second M is wrong, it's not monetary, but it's financial policy.
 And a lot of theory is not found in the younger authors. So I would be careful with MNT.
 But it is of course the case, you have to say that research does not work by, even in natural sciences, not by inventing a completely new paradigm and thinking about it,
 but the question is, what are certain causal connections and can I find empirical evidence for this?
 So an empirical support of these theoretically claimed connections.
 And that's how research works today in the teaching of economics.
 We have adapted to natural sciences in a certain way. And that's how research works today in the Department of Economics.
 We have adapted to the natural sciences in a certain way.
 However, the VWL is not a physics.
 And also not a natural science.
 It's not a natural science, despite all the mathematics.
 But you have to be a little careful with the natural sciences.
 It's not like physics is a uniform structure.
 Quantum physics and relativity theory are also competing.
 But economics is more like a science of the mind.
 Social science. It's not a science of the mind.
 I try to separate them.
 I like to count the lawyers in social sciences,
 although they sometimes defend themselves.
 But in any case, economics, sociology and politics are part of it.
 It's nice that you say that, because economists sometimes act as if what they say is the law of nature.
 No, no, that's not the case.
 So you have to see that the decisions that are made in societies,
 both for economic and social and political reasons,
 are made by individuals and not by particles.
 That's just a huge difference to the natural sciences.
 What directions did the professors have where you were? Were you shaped there? So there is
 then, at that time it was called so ordo-liberal, one of the socialists, how can you imagine that?
 Yes, I can't really say how politically they are to be identified.
 Someone like Olaf Sievert was pragmatic and a member of the Council of Representatives and then oriented towards economic policy.
 Probably more conservative.
 So close to the CDU.
 He later became head of the Central Bank in Saxony-Thuringia at the end of his career.
 But I can't say that he was a member of the CDU.
 Does the CDU name him ordo-liberal?
 Not necessarily. He was really an eclectic scientist. He still lives.
 What is that then?
 Someone who puts together his thoughts from very different directions.
 He had some Austrian components, especially when he analyzed the labor market.
 That was very interesting. He had some political ideas, partly Hayekian, and on the other hand he relied a lot on Keynes.
 And this combination of Keynes and Austrian school is not found so often.
 You still find them today at Karl Christian von Weizsäcker, for example, but otherwise very, very little. And of course, even in the research at that time, it was not as methodically shaped as it is today.
 Or how I got to know it over my doctoral studies over time.
 And someone like Werner Pomerene may have started as a Keynesian-oriented, but that was actually not the case anymore. But that wasn't really it. It was very pragmatic and interested in political economy and investigated the inclinations of politicians and the like.
 How did you start before we talk about where you are now?
 What do you mean by started?
 You mean the one is ... As I said, I come from a traditional SPD family and I was interested in what the state can do to reduce unemployment.
 That's what we've already mentioned.
 But then I gained the impression in my studies, through this diversity of different impressions, that it's too simple, that it doesn't work.
 And then I didn't become more active in this party political work.
 I was still in a legislative period in a municipal parliament
 and when the legislature was over, I didn't get involved anymore.
 So I was once at a congress of the young socialists of the Saarländische.
 I found that, even at that time,
 far from what was taught to us in the study,
 far from what was taught to us in the study,
 in economic context.
 This contradicted everything that we were presented with
 empirically in the study.
 The most sensible in that time was Heiko Maas,
 whom I met there.
 Our foreign minister now?
 Yes.
 Who did you meet?
 He was...
 Through the SPD?
 Yes, through my SPD membership at that time at this congress of the young socialists.
 And then on the other hand we met again and again in the same building,
 because the economists and lawyers had lectures in the same building at the university in Saarbrücken, building 16.
 How would you describe your thought building today?
 Liberal.
 Ordo-liberal, neo-liberal?
 Yes, it is strongly economically organized.
 I already put a rule of thumb on what concerns economic policy and think that rule of thumb is the right thing to do.
 What does that mean?
 That means that the state, with its economic policy, above all, sets the framework conditions.
 That it does not try to intervene in market events in such a way that it sets the result.
 For example, in the form of minimum wages or rent caps and the like.
 I am always a bit more skeptical about subsidies.
 This is also an immediate intervention in the market situation by supporting companies immediately.
 And I ask, especially in macroeconomics, how do you manage to get good results with institutional framework conditions?
 How should they be designed?
 What is the difference between an ordo-liberal and a neo-liberal?
 That's not that easy, because the word neo-liberalism
 comes from the discussions that were conducted in the 1930s.
 That's where it comes from.
 But today it might have a different meaning.
 Exactly. It was shaped in the past in a way that was different from the classical liberalism
 of the 19th century. By authors that we consider to be ordo-liberal today. Alexander Rüstow
 shaped this word on the Colloque of Liebmann, for example, and made it very clear that
 it was about this separation. So not laissez-faire, but the state should set framework conditions so that particular problems do not occur in competition politics or in the intensity of competition
 of a economy, so that we do not get powerful structures. The cartel formation
 in the Weimar Republic was a thorn in the eye of the original neoliberals and
 you have to intervene and say we will break the cartel or prevent it through bribes or we will not allow fusions and the like.
 So the fight against market-dominant positions was very important to the original neoliberals and Reagan so that the word neoliberalism became a curse word in political discussions, a fighting term.
 I wouldn't say rightly. You have to see the situation in England and the USA.
 That's always connected with social state destruction. Yes, of course. But that means that if I position a fighting term with certain political interests, I try to prevent certain things.
 And possibly that's what social development is.
 Is a nicer term than asocial politics?
 It's a bit nicer, that's true. You could also be happy to see that the political debate, especially with the Setscher government, was difficult to fight.
 The reduction in the power of the English unions that Setscher has had, is of course from a German understanding that we have a kind of social destruction with the tariff autonomy and with which we have been driving relatively well.
 Of course, you have to see that Great Britain had a different system and was actually pretty much on the ground when Thatcher came to power.
 Thatcher also said at the time, there is no society, there are only men and women and families.
 Yes, that is the resonance body for economics.
 We also say that with the so-called methodological individualism, the social decisions,
 that is also what is going on economically in society,, the result of individual actions and not from a society as an organ of action
 in any form is called forth.
 Why not?
 The actual decision-makers are only individuals.
 Ultimately, this applies to every company,
 this applies to every state organization.
 And the question is under what framework conditions,
 that is, with which restrictions
 do the decision-makers operate?
 That means we are not part of a society?
 Of course we are part of a society,
 but the society as such does not make decisions.
 Not at the election urn either?
 That is ...
 If you live in a political direction?
 No, those are decisions of individuals.
 Then the voters make the decisions.
 But isn't society the sum of individual decisions?
 Exactly, but only the sum of individual decisions, given the existing restrictions.
 Society is not more than the sum of individual decisions.
 Not? I would have thought so.
 That society is more than the sum of the individual parts?
 The decisions that are made in a society are the sum of the individual decisions that the individuals in this society make.
 Individual parts sounds like if you take apart a car, then it doesn't work anymore.
 Why do we talk about the people's economy?
 Yes, I just said that I don't find this expression adequate anymore.
 Herbert Giersch has already spoken of a delta economy in the 80s.
 Yes, but that's the super people's economy.
 In principle you are right.
 But according to your logic, one would have to say the economy of individuals.
 Of 83 million individuals in Germany. Yes, and more, because we depend say the economy of individuals. Of 83 million individuals in Germany.
 Yes, and more, because we depend on the foreign framework conditions.
 Those who make a choice in the federal election, well, we have fewer voters than the 82 million who live in Germany, but yes, it's the voters who decide.
 You are quite liberal, right?
 You can still say, because many people confuse it with neoliberalism,
 can you say why you are not neoliberal?
 Because it is often today as a fighting term, because I don't think of laissez-faire.
 I think that we can make individual decisions in the market economy freely, given certain restrictions. I would not want to accept that contractual freedom is driven so far that companies can form a cartel, can make agreements.
 For example, especially competition policy is an essential element of the ordoliberal. I am very pleased to see that some neoliberal ideas need a state influence in macroeconomic decisions, both from the monetary and fiscal side.
 I am only reserved and more reserved than others. I would not want to claim that we can manage to control the economy. That won't work. But we need, in such a difficult crisis as we have experienced it the last two times,
 of course, an expansive fiscal policy.
 Are there monopolies and cartels in Germany?
 We always have cartel agreements that are then uncovered and punished.
 Auto companies, for example?
 I don't know if you can say that about auto companies.
 There is the famous Spiegel title, the cartel.
 I mean, that was a cartel. They discussed how they deal with diesel vehicles.
 I'm always careful, even from my time as a board member,
 that I then gladly accept retrospectively,
 when the cartel decision of the cartel office or the European authorities says,
 that was a cartel and you have to pay this fine, then it goes through the courts because of me and in the end it is paid.
 The cartel office must first say that it is a cartel before you can do anything else.
 I don't want to check that. I'm going back to saying that this was already a cartel or that was already a cartel and it wasn't approached in any way.
 But of course we have had this problem over and over again.
 And we can be happy that we can do relatively much with our competition law here.
 What about monopolies?
 Well, monopolies are harder to maintain in life over time if they don't somehow enjoy additional protection.
 We have this idea in our field that natural monopolies can arise, for example because there are network effects or something like that.
 But in the course of time, it is also obvious that natural monopolies are protected again and again by state regulation to the outside before competition.
 Give examples for Germany. Where are there currently monopolies?
 I don't see a real monopoly at the moment.
 The railway?
 The railway is not a monopoly in the sense that we have competition on the regional level.
 There are probably rules on when a monopoly is a monopoly.
 From 80% market domination and so on.
 There will be some criteria.
 Yes, but there is always a dispute about what the right criterion and the right threshold value is.
 What is your threshold value? No, no, no, I don't have a threshold value for it.
 I'm trying to ...
 So a clear monopoly is just the only provider you have.
 We can now consider whether this is the case in regional context, for example.
 If you had to say, we have a big hotel on the spot,
 where anyone who wants to be trained in the trade wants to look for a job, then you can say there is regional market power.
 Simply because this hotel in a small town can choose its apprentices and maybe then also dictates conditions that are not so good.
 There you come to the sensibility of a minimum wage for correct regional market power on the part of the demand for work.
 Is Google a monopoly on search engines?
 Google has a market-dominant position. I would not say a monopoly, because the competition also comes from the other major providers.
 95% of the search requests go to Google.
 Yes, but then you have to limit the market and say that this is the case for search engines now. But if we look at other aspects, there is the danger for Google that a company like Facebook offers competition in various respects.
 Facebook has a different monopoly somewhere and and some people might leave it alone.
 So we have a kind of oligopoly, but not oligopolistic competition.
 Everyone stays in their own area and tries not to hurt the other.
 These are also behaviors that we know very well in the history of the economy.
 Do we have oligopolies?
 We certainly have oligopolies. Especially if you look at the automobile manufacturers, not only the German ones, but you can look at them worldwide. There are not that many worldwide.
 Oligopolies means when four or five companies dominate the market.
 When few. We'll say few. There can be more than five, but there are still fewer companies that dominate the market. As I said, if we go worldwide, we have more than five providers in the automotive industry.
 We're talking about Germany. There is also energy and so in the energy sector.
 We have three in Germany. In the energy sector, we have only, there is a lot of state provision for the electricity and power economy.
 How do we get rid of an oligopoly?
 The question is always how harmful it actually is with an oligopoly.
 The oligopoly can, as I mentioned, if there is an oligopolistic competition, very likely to be very intensive among a few providers.
 So if they don't let themselves be at ease.
 Can, can.
 Yes, that means of course that I have to be an oligopolist.
 The state must ensure that it must be so.
 Exactly. That means you have to go from the state side oligopolist
 check again and again whether there are agreements or not.
 And if there is an agreement, then you have to punish accordingly.
 Is it smarter for an oligopolist to talk to the other oligopolists or not?
 Well, I'm here as a public servant who looks at the whole thing in a comprehensive way and have the impression that the profits that can be achieved through the agreements in the oligopoly
 cannot be rewarded for the harsh penalties that are then imposed on the EU level.
 So we are now at such high penalties that it is already serious.
 What advantages does oligopoly have for a society and what disadvantages? The advantage is that you can achieve scale advantages with large companies in certain industries.
 That means the costs are distributed to a larger production.
 That is an advantage for the companies. That's an advantage, but it's also an advantage for the customers, for the consumers,
 if this advantage is passed on to them.
 And for that, the competition between these companies must be there.
 In this respect, an oligopoly is not bad per se,
 but it has to be regulated accordingly.
 But that splits into a advantage and a disadvantage.
 If they pass it on to you, it's an advantage, if not, it's a disadvantage.
 Normally, the competition ensures that we have a price increase.
 Unless they cancel it.
 Unless they cancel it. And that's why you have to prevent the cancellation.
 We're obviously not that good in that, if there's still oligopoly in Germany.
 Every cancellation ... wait a minute, if there are cartel agreements in Germany, we are not so good.
 The oligopoly itself is not harmful, so again, I emphasize it again, the oligopoly itself is not harmful, but the question is, are there agreements?
 And the nature of such secret agreements is that you can only discover them afterwards.
 That's always the case. So we have to make sure that our competition authorities are good enough to think about it in time.
 But they are not there to prevent oligopoly or get rid overrides or fusions at eye level,
 that is checked in which form a market-dominated position occurs here
 and the fusion is then subordinated.
 We had this in the press at the production of trains by Siemens and Alstom. Both wanted to merge, that would have been a
 merger at eye level, so they wanted to work together in this branch and that has been
 denied by the cartel authorities. Now we have the collaboration Alstom-Bombardier,
 which has been approved. But of course we would have had a completely different situation.
 A market-dominant position would have been created and the competition authorities
 did not allow it, in my opinion. It's a difficult case, I know that.
 I'm sure I'll get bad signatures now, that's always the case when I say it so clearly.
 There is always the discussion whether or not you champions are needed to be able to compete internationally.
 The market is also international.
 But I think it's wrong to want to have a national champion who can set higher prices in Europe or in Germany, i.e. monopolistic prices,
 can use his market-dominant position to have more available so that he can compete in China.
 I think that's wrong.
 You're describing Lufthansa, right?
 No, Lufthansa is a different situation.
 At the moment Lufthansa is pretty much on the ground.
 I've read that Lufthansa makes nice, fat prices here in Germany.
 That's why this question of monopoly is a bit difficult.
 That's what I'm asking.
 Finding out one of these monopolists is difficult.
 But of course there are always monopolies on very specific market parts.
 So, one example, very simple.
 My airport is Basel-Mühlhus normally.
 That means I have to go to Mühlhausen,
 which belongs to the Swiss operator of this airport,
 and then flies to Berlin or somewhere else.
 For a long time there were flight slots from Basel-Mühlhus to Munich that were only operated by the Lufthansa.
 After the deployment of Air Berlin, Easyjet took over a number over slots, they also got slots to Munich for compensation for what they had given to the Lufthansa elsewhere in Basel-Mülhoz.
 And suddenly the prices that the Lufthansa demanded have dropped by a third.
 Of course we have the situation that is then again and again tried to be exploited on site. Am I the only provider who does that now or not. Can you as a state simply ensure that there is no monopoly?
 So by making preventive laws or regulations, that you say, okay, a company shouldn't just get bigger or something.
 I think you can't do that that way.
 So to say that's the right size, that's not possible to determine. You can also use other that's the right size.
 You can also use other factors besides size.
 I think you have to try to decide procedurally.
 What I just mentioned, the creation of national champions,
 this goal setting in the system of a political system,
 is wrong in my opinion. You shouldn't do that.
 You won't get into the problem of you have a monopolist afterwards with whom you somehow have to deal with.
 Are they European champions?
 It's exactly the same. So especially then, European champions means that they would have a market-dominant position in Europe,
 not only in Germany, but throughout Europe and then carry that on to the outside.
 Of course, we have talked about Google and how to deal with them.
 The EU is now important for that has 100,000 employees and
 at 101st we will beat it or so. Defeating is not provided in our competition law anyway
 . So that means we have a whole range of
 possibilities to proceed in competition law. Defeating is not provided?
 No. The difference is in American competition law, where the
 defeat has been put in again. Yes, that's put back in. There is a long discussion about it.
 Oh dear, do you want to start with me now?
 Only if you want to.
 If it is understandable for the layman.
 Exactly, that's the problem, to explain it later, whether it makes sense or not.
 Okay, you are against national champions, against European champions.
 What do we do in your logic if the Americans have national champions, the Chinese have national champions?
 Yes, we as a market are so important that these providers want to offer us. If they don't do it, we don't have a problem.
 Then we can offer our European providers.
 Yes, because then the American and Chinese champions are making themselves available to us.
 Yes, if they can make themselves available. We can also try to go against these champions with our European competition policy.
 And that's exactly what we're doing nowadays.
 So if you look at the latest novella in the GWB, the law on competition restrictions,
 there are a whole series of regulations that aim at such platform companies,
 and in general platform companies and not just Google,
 to go around in such a way that they have to reduce their market-dominant orders and can no longer proceed to that extent.
 Is it actually in the constitution that there should be no monopoly or something?
 I'm not a lawyer, but not in my knowledge.
 Our economic system is not even fixed in the constitution.
 Exactly, that's the point. And that's not bad either.
 Why?
 That's right, in my opinion. There was the discussion whether one should write down social market economy as an economic system.
 No, we have a whole series of foundations that ultimately determine the system of market economy on the one hand and the social policy,
 that is, the social state aspect. And that's enough for us. We don't need to define the economic system separately.
 So the property guarantee, for example, in the Basic Law.
 Freedom of expression and other freedoms are fixed, which are essential, fundamental for market economy.
 And on the other hand, we have the social state guarantee, which then determines this adjective social market economy.
 So that's why we don't need all of that.
 It's basically in there indirectly.
 True.
 I just came up with the idea that our constitutional protection agencies interpret it differently sometimes.
 I mean, there will be end zones that are deliberately anti-capitalist
 already classified as an observation case because they are anti-capitalist.
 But that's not a state hazard.
 Yes, I mean, what the constitutional protection does, I'm not a specialist for that, I like to hold back.
 It also has a monopoly.
 I'm different with the constitutional courts, but with the constitutional protection, yes, that's of course the case.
 Can you shut them down? I'm afraid no. I'm afraid that we will need such institutions in the security sector and we will have to see how we can monitor them properly.
 If you had a right of wish as an economist, as former chairman of the State Department, what would be part of the basic law from an economic point of view?
 That's a really difficult question, because I actually think that we shouldn't change that much in the constitution.
 The debt break was already in there.
 It's already in there, I've been in for it. You know that I'm a big advocate of the debt break and I think it should stay that way.
 So that was the only and last thing that was included in the constitution?
 I don't know if that's the last thing, but it should be in the constitution, in my opinion.
 I think a fiscal rule in our German system develops a binding effect if we have it legally secured. Otherwise probably not.
 And that's why our fiscal rules have always been in the constitution, even if you go to the time before the founding of the Federal Republic, so the Weimar Republic because of me. We have always had constitutional rules,
 always had fiscal rules on the constitutional level,
 because in the 19th century we had a wide range of lawsuits in the multilateral system.
 Then you started with fiscal rules, because these lawsuits came up then.
 And yes, accordingly, I think it's right to define that as constitutional.
 But the nice thing is that you always have to ask yourself in such constitutions,
 how open are they for new social developments in the future,
 which we then have to secure by law.
 I don't see that at the moment, which may also have to do with the fact that I'm not a lawyer.
 But I think we should keep this open and make sure that we will also make the changes in the constitution in the future.
 We change the constitution more often, especially when it comes to the interplay of states, countries and municipalities.
 You can be critical of the changes in the past years at many points.
 But that's not something I would be on to demand a change in the constitution.
 But now an important election is in place. It could happen that a political constitution will come out that will throw the debt brake out of the constitution.
 Do you know who to turn to?
 Yes, I will write against it every day if it has to be.
 Explain for the tenants what the debt break mean? The debt break means that the decisions for taxes, other deductions and expenses then have to be made by the decision-makers today and all those who are affected by them also have decision-making power.
 You have to explain it differently.
 The debt break ensures that the distribution conflicts that the public household always keeps ready have to be resolved today
 and not only in the future, but also by future generations.
 Because if at some point the situation should arise
 that the financial policy is running out of control,
 then the future generations will suffer especially.
 I would have wished that Greece had had a debt break in the 1980s.
 Then we wouldn't have had the collapse of the Greek economy.
 And it was especially the younger people who were affected, not the older ones.
 But don't you think that future generations will be grateful to us,
 if we now, nowadays,
 put hundreds of billions,
 if not even billions of euros into climate protection,
 so that these future generations have a life value?
 Yes, I am firmly convinced of that.
 So climate protection is, in my opinion is one of the most important...
 I can't imagine that my grandchildren would say at some point,
 it's good that you have kept the debt break rule at that time.
 It's just a pity that the planet is 5 degrees warmer.
 Yes, if you do the trade-off like that, you can have both.
 You can do a reasonable climate protection on the one hand and keep the debt break on the other.
 The question is, what does it mean to have to pump so many billions into climate protection?
 First of all, you have to say that we get effective climate protection by reducing CO2.
 I don't want to talk about climate protection itself, but just the money that is put in.
 Yes, but you have to. You have to talk about it, because just putting money there doesn't help at all if we don't reduce CO2.
 So just to say that we in Germany now have a climate-neutral economy, the rest of the world doesn't care, that helps the future generation zero.
 But I wanted to stay with the debt brake itself. Debt brake means income, expenses basically the same.
 And with the climate we could say, okay, we're doing a lot of expenses because of the future generation.
 You could also say, let's raise the income.
 Then the tax break is stopped again.
 Yes, I think so.
 We have a lack of capital, taxes and I don't know.
 If you think we need these massive expenses for climate protection, then you have to finance them through taxes.
 That's the position I'm representing.
 Although you have to say again, the debt brake is a bit more complex.
 It's not like we don't make debts today.
 Last year and this year we had record debt rates.
 There is a limit, a percentage limit.
 There is a normal limit, a rule limit for normal debt in normal times.
 And what is possible in debt is fluctuating around this rule.
 In boom times you have to build surplus, in worse times, recessions and heavy crises you make decent deficits.
 That is very Keynesian thought, to be honest.
 But we are in a heavy climate crisis, we have to make a lot of deficits. We are not yet in the climate crisis. I think we would only get in if we did not reach the 2-degree goal.
 Or maybe the other half-time goal.
 Then it's too late. Then it's too late.
 Then we have the crisis. That's exactly the point.
 The crisis only comes when the cart is in the dirt.
 The crisis we have now is the corona crisis.
 We are not yet in the climate crisis. We can still react.
 A debt crisis does not occur when you have low debts, but it occurs when you cannot pay your debts anymore.
 So if you have driven the cart into the dirt. And that's why you have to react beforehand. And you have to do that with climate protection as well.
 I thought we had the cart in the dirt for a long time and that's why the world is getting warmer. No, we can achieve much more with a decent CO2 allocation
 and we can also achieve international agreements much easier with a decent CO2 allocation.
 That climate protection policy must be operated in conjunction with this,
 for example by providing infrastructure that is necessary for other technologies,
 by seeing through research and development, we can see what we can achieve further.
 And for that we need additional expenses from the state. That's clear.
 But for example, I would be against the fact that the industry, especially the particularly dirty industry today,
 comes to the federal government and says, yes, you want the climate transformation,
 that costs us so much money if we now switch to hydrogen, for example.
 Pay us for that.
 That's why we have companies that act privately and make profits.
 So are you also against the coal exit, that our coal companies can now be on the market for another 10, 20 years?
 So to be honest, yes. For me, the coal exit is above all a regional political measure to provide more political peace in the regions.
 To dig up resources so that other things can be operated.
 We should have left them flat. Or should we have left them to the market?
 No, you can't leave anything to the market with an externality like climate problems.
 You have to make sure that CO2 emissions are not too high.
 But then it would be even worse for the coal companies.
 If they don't have any subsidies anymore, but have to pay CO2 prices, they are even more likely to leave the market.
 I think you can't even say that so easily.
 If I look at the steel industry, there are of course a number of companies that do their work by working with electricity as energy carriers.
 They don't have such a big problem.
 If the electricity comes from renewable energies,
 such a steel company can continue to work without further ado.
 Would be able to sell certificates.
 No, so you have to see again,
 and then we talk about CO2 prices,
 which go far beyond what we have now.
 We would have to talk about a size of 100 euros per ton of CO2.
 And that is the idea that is, in my opinion, the right one for a reasonable climate
 protection policy. You take money with it. So it's not like the debt
 break is preventing income from trading emission certificates on the state side.
 Is the debt break an audio-liiberalism set in the basic law?
 In a way, yes. If modern autoliberalism, modern order economy is understood as a rule orientation for the economic policy, it is a rule for the financial policy, yes.
 And needs more rules. So you don't have that in your head anymore. You couldn't say that earlier.
 Yes, yes.
 That something is missing in the constitution?
 No, I wanted to hold back on the question of what needs to be written into the constitution.
 Also because I'm not a lawyer.
 You can express your wish and then we let our lawyers...
 Wishes are something for Christmas.
 So not for the economy. I rarely express these wishes.
 I have certain ideas that aim at removing the problems we have.
 Then I can also present competing ideas.
 So that's not a matter of wishes. No, the point is rather that I would ask myself whether we might think about our political system at other points.
 I am from my research in the past and also currently a representative of a federalism that is competitively aligned,
 i.e. with clearer competence regulations on all levels, not such a mixed system as we have in Germany. And secondly, always someone who sees direct national rights, i.e. referendums and initiatives,
 as a possibility to complement the representative rulebook that we have.
 We'll talk about that later. We'll take a short break, because you brought a lot of time.
 So we want to use them, but we have to take a break for that. We'll be back in ten minutes.
 See you.
 So, here we are again.
 Do you find debt problematic as a term?
 Because in German,
 the term debt is often associated with it.
 Yes, you know,
 I'm kind of pragmatic.
 I grew up with the term
 and I try not to load it morally.
 So not in the sense of debt and debts.
 That's maybe the advantage that I'm not a Germanist, but an economist.
 But you can differentiate that. Can people differentiate that?
 Because a lot of people think about debt.
 Yes, I try to make it clear when I talk about debt, that you can't use the typical analogies that come to mind.
 So already from the concept, but also the idea that is in the private sector.
 You have to pay your debts back at some point.
 The idea of the Swabian housewife applied to the state.
 I think that's all wrong.
 So state debt has completely different limits and completely different problems,
 but also completely different advantages.
 And state debts could also be removed at some point, be cut.
 Yes, well, they are always cut formally on the one hand, that's clear. That means we don't have
 a loss of payments, Germany operates its loans and ...
 Yes, but in a major crisis there are always debt conferences and then debts are
 cut.
 Yes, the typical thing we have is that less developed countries or
 threshold countries have these debt conferences.
 Argentina is a notorious case that comes around again and again with a new restructuring.
 So that happens on the one hand, but the interesting thing is that it is also a remittance that takes place.
 And if you look again at what conditions this happens,
 often it is not worse for the believers if the debt is repaid.
 So you always have to look closely at what's happening there and to what extent debts are being paid in the sense that we actually have a haircut.
 Wouldn't it be possible to make a total global reset, to put all debts in all states to zero?
 Even if you wanted to have the mother of the financial crisis, it's possible.
 Why is that? Why is that dangerous?
 Because on the other hand there are always the believers who lose a lot of wealth and when they lose this wealth they are bankrupt.
 It depends on who the believers are. If they are believers who have so much money that it doesn't matter.
 The typical thing is that the believers sit in the banking system and then the banks collapse as we have experienced in the banking crisis.
 The financial and banking crisis recently.
 Was that bad?
 I didn't find the impact at that time unproblematic. I found it bad.
 And we also experienced a lot of suffering in the following EU debt crisis.
 It's not like everything was fine what happened there.
 But a banking crisis could always come again, right?
 Yes, of course. That's why we have a task to do something in banking regulation again and again.
 You have achieved a lot with the banking regulation that came after the financial crisis,
 but we still have a shadow bank. Enough is never enough.
 I don't know if you still know Konstantin Wecker, but he wrote such a nice song
 about it and it's just like that. Enough is not enough. You can always imagine more.
 The question is how to do it best and I always advise to act differently. I think
 that we now, for example, still have serious problems in the shadow banking system
 and have to see how we can get better regulation there.
 Speaking of differentiation, are there good debts that a state can make and bad debts?
 The state can, yes, of course it can make good debts, but the point is that if the state actually does what it should, namely market failure, so from an economic point of view now. That means
 correct market failures, create a certain social and political balance, also macroeconomically
 do certain things. Everything that belongs to regulation and the rule of law
 is included. Then he does reasonable things overall. And you can't say there is now
 one category of spending that is better than the other. Yes, for example investments in education, in climate protection, that are also good debts.
 You could say that this does not count as debts, we count this as investments.
 Well, the debt is the financing side.
 Either you finance the investment via taxes or you finance the investment via debts.
 So roughly speaking. But that's the
 financing side. The expenditure side is investments or consumption expenses or transfer expenses.
 These are the three functional categories on the expenditure side. And the nice thing is that you can
 use all the terms. So if you say education, they normally do not belong under the
 investment term. So the expenses for education, as long as they do not take place in buildings,
 i.e. anything that has to do with concrete, do not count as investments, but as consumption.
 The teacher's salaries are all consumption expenses.
 How should we change that?
 Well, if you do that ...
 Because we invest in our children.
 Right. The point, and this is also completely clear in the economy, but in the economy it is also clear that the investments in the rule of law, if it works well, are also investments.
 And yet the salaries of the judges are all counted as consumer expenses with us.
 Why?
 On the other hand, we calculate, for example, the construction of children's money as an investment.
 If you go through this, you will always find out that if the state does something meaningful,
 you can see it as an investment in the future for our future generations, for ourselves, for this state.
 And then we can leave it out of the school break. No, because the point is that you can also do everything in the transfer area,
 everything that we do as a social insurance, if it is not exaggerated and is meaningful,
 also as an investment.
 Well, but then everything that the state does is investment and then you would have to say,
 then it has to owe 100% and not finance it over taxes.
 That can't work.
 But you say there is a saying that even for good debts there is a upper limit.
 I'm saying that there is a total upper limit for debts.
 We can't say which state expenses...
 So just by categorizing you can't say what good and bad expenses are.
 Well, yes.
 Expenses for climate protection against climate change?
 No, there are...
 I mean, you can say that we have an expense for climate protection and certain companies in the Ruhr area in the steel industry are paying their initial investment.
 Then I would say that these are not good expenses for climate protection. You can put that under the heading climate protection, but it's not good. I don't want to pay any subsidies.
 But you know that good investments can make good debts. And then and then you could say okay and those, there are no...
 But still, basically you have to say really clearly in which areas of the state what exactly to do.
 Even with the classic state investments, think of the traffic infrastructure.
 I don't want us to have eight-lane highways everywhere, pulled tightly through Germany.
 I don't think that's right. I actually think that we have to see
 that in all necessity, where there are new and new buildings that may be necessary because of me
 in some places, the basic principle must be, especially in the sense of climate protection,
 in the next few years, that we put more traffic on the tracks.
 No more highways. That's what the Greens say, for example.
 That's too radical for me. So I there are definitely motorway sections where we need an expansion.
 Really wide traffic axes that are so heavily driven that we have big traffic jams.
 But we need less cars and less individual traffic in the future.
 We also need less roads.
 We must above all put traffic on the rails.
 And then I just have to determine deposits.
 And if traffic is invested on the rail, are those good debts?
 I do not take any investment out of the limitation caused by the debt break.
 But there is an upper limit for good things.
 Well, with the size of the household we have and the possibility to finance via taxes, there is no upper limit for good things.
 Only in the sense that people may not be willing to pay so much taxes for it.
 And then vote for other parties because of me.
 But that is actually the crucial point.
 Because we always have goal conflicts in view of the different expenses.
 Some want this, others want that.
 And these conflicts of goals have to be resolved.
 That is the distribution problem that is there in the state household.
 And it has to be financed through taxes.
 What about climate-damaging subsidies?
 The Federal Environment Agency indicates every year
 that between 50 and 60 billion euros in tax money
 flow into direct and indirect subsidies in Germany.
 Should one take them?
 Energy sector, diesel privilege, no kerosene tax in the air traffic, etc.
 Do they all have to be removed? They have to be removed.
 Everything that is climate-damaging has to be removed.
 We should definitely take off climate-damaging subsidies.
 I think we should take off tax incentives and subsidies in general,
 which are unfavorable.
 So not only for climate protection, there are also other areas.
 I would not take the diesel privilege, but the service car privilege.
 I would abolish that, for example.
 Why abolish the service car privilege, but not the diesel privilege?
 With the diesel privilege we have different environmental policy requirements that we have to discuss. On the one hand, what concerns the CO2 problem, diesel is typically cheaper than gasoline.
 What concerns the NOx problem, it is not cheaper.
 Either you do it in such a way that you differentiate between CO2 pricing and pricing for other pollutants,
 for example NOx, or we find alternative solutions.
 I would have preferred it, and it is the case, that I would have preferred,
 if we approach the control, to have a wide range of measurements
 without any major exceptions.
 I would actually prefer that.
 Back to your career. Can you briefly tell us, you wrote about your doctorate.
 Yes, so first of all, after my studies, or at the end of my studies, I studied in Saarbrücken and at the end of my studies I went to stay in the field of minor business,
 I spent hours in the clinic as a nurse.
 I was an assistant at Pomarene for a year, from 1993 to 1994,
 after my first phase as a doctor, so to speak.
 And then he died of a heart attack. Then a few weeks
 after that I was asked by his assistant if I wanted to move to St. Gallen to finish the dissertation
 there and then I did. At the confirmation? Yes, well, I just said that Werner Pomerene
 was part of the Freischule. This is a very friendly collegial association of professors.
 And the early generation of Freischulers were just as old as Bruno Frey himself.
 And they had a very good contact with each other.
 And one of these colleagues, Gebhard Kirchgesner, asked me if I wanted to come to St. Gallen. Because the topic I started working on with my dissertation was the topic of tax competition in Switzerland.
 It is the case that the tax burden between the cantons is very, very different.
 And I had already done the first empirical work on this, together with Pommerene and Kirchgessner.
 And then Gebhard said to me, then do it finish this in St.Gallen and come to me.
 I did that.
 I moved to St.Gallen in April 1995
 with my family and then
 promoted in 1999.
 Did you live in Switzerland for 4 years?
 A little longer. First of all, I went abroad
 in 1998 and got a promotion grant from the Swiss National Fund.
 I was in Los Angeles at the University of Southern California for half a year and then another half a year in the UK.
 Then I went back and finished my PhD, or rather I finished and passed the PhD at that time.
 I had my PhD in 1999 and became a full-time lecturer in St. Gallen for the postdoc phase. Today it's called assistant professor, which we know as junior professors in Germany.
 And I was able to apply until 2002.
 And lived that long in Switzerland.
 And what does tax reform in Switzerland mean?
 That the difference in burden with income and profit tax is enormous.
 So the cantons have the basic competence to tax income and profits.
 The municipalities raise such a contribution so that there can be a different burden between the municipalities and cities.
 The federal government also has its own direct federal tax on income and profits.
 And these are not calculated under each other.
 That means there is a cumulative burden.
 And that is very different.
 An example is when you live in Zurich, you pay about the city of Zurich and the canton of Zurich
 with an income, a taxable income,
 so all the deductions are gone, from one million Swiss francs a year to more than 25 percent income tax.
 And then comes the direct federal tax in the amount of 11. something percent.
 If you go to the Freienbach community in the canton of Schwitz, half an hour away, you pay about 8% income tax for the same income.
 Nice. Why aren't they all going there?
 Because the differences in tax burden in real estate prices and rents are decreasing.
 Yes.
 That's an important difference. And because on the other hand, Freienbach…
 That's where 8% income tax is, the real estate prices are higher.
 We economists like to say that ceteris paribus is higher. So given what is offered there in the Freienbach community, they are higher.
 And in Freienbach there are probably many more millionaires and billionaires who can afford it. Exactly. We also know that in other cantons. I have now named the canton Schwitz and the community of Freienbach.
 In Schwitz, of course, you have other communities that are a little more attractive than Freienbach.
 Or we have the canton Zug, which is best known for this and has been driving this tax saving model for a long time.
 And of course it also plays a role in terms of infrastructure services.
 Some people prefer to live in Zurich, even if they have a higher tax burden, because Zurich is simply more attractive. It's nicer to live in Zurich than in Freienbach.
 Is there a country financial balance in Switzerland?
 There is a financial balance, it's not just a country financial balance. It's always a system in our country.
 A canton financial balance.
 It's a system in which the federal government also plays a role. But there is also a balance, a horizontal financial balance between the cantons. Do you think it's right that there is a balance between countries in Germany?
 I think that's right, but I think it's too egalitarian.
 What does that mean?
 It's the case that the financial differences between all countries are too much.
 And that's why it happens that if, for example, the Saarland had an additional settlement and could realize higher tax revenues,
 that in the system of the financial balance that has been in force since last year, an over-leveling takes place. That means, so ...
 Please don't say too many foreign words.
 I try. So I'll explain again from the beginning.
 Let's say that Saarland has a new settlement and has a million additional tax revenues.
 And then the financial balance that has been valid since last year is taken away by over a million,
 because Saarland then gets less from the financial balance system.
 That means it's not worth making a new settlement at all.
 So over the million. That means we have in that sense ...
 For the society probably because there are jobs.
 Yes, there are jobs through it, that's right. But financially, that's
 uninteresting for the Saarland. And that's why there is always the risk that you are not
 documented enough.
 But financial policy is perhaps not always the most obvious criterion.
 But often.
 But should that in the end, the most important thing is not always the most obvious criterion. But often.
 But should it be like that?
 That it is such an important criterion. It is simply so. I don't know if it has to be the most important thing. But it is just an important criterion.
 I am quite pragmatic. It is just the way it is.
 But which criteria are even more important or more equal?
 I don't do any ...
 Social ... or even more important? I don't do any social work. Yes, thank you for the keyword.
 Workplaces are something that brings something to society.
 Yes, but workplaces only bring something if you think about it. So I mean,
 to create a workplace, because of me, also from the state side, if you
 dig up bottles and dig them out again, that doesn't help. I mean, we also have to have
 workplaces that create value, that give people a perspective, that's no good. I mean, we also have to have jobs that create value,
 that give people a perspective,
 that also give people a job that they enjoy.
 So there are many aspects that play a role in this.
 And I don't want to put luck and the like as an absolute category.
 That's why I don't have a lexicographic order,
 as it is so nice to call it, where I would say
 that is the absolute goal that we should pursue in society.
 There are different goals and they compete with each other.
 One goal that we should pursue as a society is a balanced life situation in Germany.
 Then a national financial balance is a good idea.
 What does balance mean?
 We have the idea that with it a minimum level ...
 That my parents have the same infrastructure as people in Munich.
 My parents live in a McDonald's in the country.
 Yes, you can argue about whether that makes sense or not.
 Because, well, we have so many additional infrastructures in Munich,
 for example in the cultural sector, which would not even attract five customers
 on the flat land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
 I'm not talking about cultural infrastructure, but infrastructure.
 Well, you can see that. We have the discussion.
 But also there, Munich needs much wider
 roads than a community in Meck-Pomm on the flat land.
 But mainly a road, right?
 It's just that some things are simply not really comparable.
 You can't say that the same thing has to be installed.
 No, actually the idea is equality of life.
 Equal, not the same.
 Well, the equality of life has already come into the law a little later anyway, with a change in the 90s.
 That's a good reason.
 We have come down from equal life conditions to equal life conditions.
 And that means that you start to think again, well, what is equal?
 Basically, it is about ensuring that we have a minimum of public services available across the country.
 And then you will always have to argue about it, what is this minimum level that you have to maintain?
 And therefore you need a financial balance, but just as you never know exactly what equality means and that it has to be re-evaluated, you also have to re-evaluate how much balance you need.
 Can an institute think out a definition?
 Yes, this definition of equality will then be controversial. This is always controversial by the Federal Constitutional Court. There are so many judgments about the national financial balance and complaints and reports written in between.
 I was involved in this regularly.
 The point is that you have to ask yourself which incentive it is to make a reasonable policy for the respective countries.
 And you can say that the German system is going too far in its balance element.
 If Tabula Rasa was there and you could you could establish it, what would it be?
 I wrote it down a few years ago in a report for the FDP.
 That you could have a system in which we give the countries more control competence. that they have the possibility to get a part of what they are now being given from the income tax
 as their share, that they can raise a part of it themselves through corresponding contributions to the income tax.
 That means, according to your suggestion, Bavaria could say, for example, we are doing an estate tax,
 we have so many billionaires, you can get a lot of it.
 Let's say Bavaria wouldn't do that. Take NRW instead. NRW could say, for example,
 well, now you take the wealth tax.
 I've spoken about the income tax.
 The wealth tax still exists in the constitution,
 but it doesn't live anymore.
 It would have to be revived.
 You could do that.
 You can discuss it differently
 how sensible such a regulation is.
 But you have to say,
 if it's about income,
 with which you really want to finance a decent amount of expenses,
 then income tax is one thing and the sales tax is another.
 These are the important types of taxes.
 A lot of money comes together there.
 But according to your idea,
 Bayern could say, we're going to do a wealth tax here,
 so that we can increase our income.
 I would not revoke the wealth tax, but I would say that the inheritance tax could do it itself.
 They should have the freedom to raise their own taxes.
 And if Bayern says, yes, income tax, that's our suggestion now.
 Regardless of the income tax.
 If the Bavarians think of a tax, that's then ...
 What I'm saying now, regardless of the wealth tax, would be quoted on Twitter as well.
 That's why I don't want a wealth tax. I don't want to revive it.
 But because of me, the inheritance tax can very well, which also relates to the wealth, and where you can also ask yourself, is it not too free at The inheritance tax could be raised by the countries, in my opinion.
 Completely in your own responsibility, both in terms of the measurement basis and in terms of the tax rates.
 Back to you. Before you became an economist, did you deal with the economic aspect? Yes, of course. As I said, one of my professors in Saarbrücken was Olaf Sievert, who was the first general secretary of the board of trustees under Giersch.
 And then from 1970 to 1985 a member of the board of directors to be prepared accordingly.
 So that you know the different economic and political concepts, they have been dispatched.
 And I have read all the reports from 1964 to 1985, no longer, until 1992.
 So that's a long time.
 And these are the big things. So I knew the annual reports.
 I knew what the board of directors is and what role it plays and so on.
 And then you thought, I'll join too.
 That's another point.
 I had already gone to the scientific advisory board of the Federal Finance Ministry before.
 And that was only one and a half years after I had started my position in Marburg. Or only one and a half years after I took my position in Marburg.
 Or already one and a half years, namely in 2003 in November.
 And I didn't hesitate to say when the call came to say I'm doing it.
 And that was also conveyed to us in Saarbrücken.
 Who was the one who called you?
 The former chairman of the scientific advisory board.
 It is the case that the two advisory boards in the finance and the Ministry of Economy have a full right to cooperate.
 That means they determine themselves the new members, members, members, you can't say that, the new members who are accepted.
 And the minister carries out this election if there are no criminal reasons.
 So typically always.
 Yes, and I was then called by Heinz Große-Kettler, who unfortunately has also passed away.
 And at the economic council, who called you there?
 That's like this, after there was a colleague who rejected the offer to go to the board of directors.
 What?
 After that happened, you are then asked in advance.
 You were the replacement or what?
 No, no, not in that case. In that case, who was it? I think it was Michael Burda from Humboldt University who decided to go to the board of directors.
 I don't remember who was chosen as a replacement back then, but it was a long time before my time.
 Michael is a bit older.
 But for me it was like this, that the successor had to be Vigard.
 And the officials of the Finance Ministry and the Department of Finance in the Chancellor's Office,
 those are the three top officials who then sit down and think about who could become a successor.
 They had a shortlist with me and Clemens Fuest and the minister then decided for me.
 And then I was asked in September, are you fundamentally ready to go to the board of directors?
 And in December there was already green light and in January it went into the press.
 The minister was Rainer Brüderle?
 Rainer Brüderle, yes.
 Did he do a good job?
 At some points yes, at some points no.
 I thought he did a good job in the financial crisis, when he asked for the help for Opel.
 In that respect he did a good job. At other points you can be more critical.
 Could you question our economic ways?
 The Council of Representatives has all the possibilities to tackle economic and political issues.
 So you could also say that our current economic system leads to a climate catastrophe, we have to change our economic ways fundamentally.
 The Council of Representatives could do that.
 But you didn't do it.
 No, for good reasons.
 Because the climate crisis is not there.
 Not only because the climate crisis is not there, but because we can also defend it with instruments
 that are very effective for climate protection and, secondly, are well anchored in the market economy.
 That's it.
 So ...
 Yes, that's the key point.
 Climate protection with market economy, although the market economy or capitalism has brought us into this situation.
 Climate protection with market economy is possible, of course.
 I mean, a market economic instrument is the CO2 price and it is highly effective.
 So why should you change this basic principle?
 Of course, the board of trustees is bound by its mandate.
 And in the law of the board of trustees, which determines the mandate, it says that it has developed its analyses and different possibilities for economic policy on the basis based on market economic order.
 So, overthrowing the market economic order,
 that would be difficult for the Council of Representatives to agree with the mandate.
 You could say, people, you have to change that.
 Yes, always change.
 Of course you can change something.
 A higher CO2 pricing means changing something.
 We're talking about decent prices, not the small stuff.
 Do the members of the economic community have to be independent? Are you independent?
 What do you mean independent and value-free? That's a long discussion.
 If we go back to Max Weber, the idealy, you have to say that every person, including every economist who comes to the Council of Comprehension, has their own values and is not free of them.
 You can't be, you're not schizophrenic.
 What, however, and this has been developed very nicely by Karl Popper, which ultimately leads to the freedom of the science, not the individual scientist.
 That is the competition among the scientists.
 And in this respect it is important that very different people from different areas come together in the board of directors.
 And that's what they tried to solve from the beginning, that you ask one member of the union, is that someone you can live with?
 And in the other direction, namely the economic associations, the employers, is that someone you can live with?
 These are the two tickets that have a certain association orientation.
 I formulate this very carefully, because there formal right to suggest anything on both sides. It has simply been established that in normal times, at least in the early stages,
 when it comes to finding someone for the board of directors,
 you also connect with the unions or the employers' associations and then try to find out if that's okay.
 On which ticket are you? and then try to find out if it's okay. What's your ticket? I'm on the ticket of a financial scientist, because since 1974 there's always been a financial scientist in it.
 So someone who knows about public finances and it's obvious that someone does that.
 But do you support the employer side or the union?
 The unions would say today, because I was appointed by the labor commission as a scientist, that I am close to employers.
 But I'm not close to employers and also not close to the trade union.
 You are close to the CDU. You are the chairman of the scientific committee of the CDU-Economical Council.
 The CDU-Economical Council is a construct in which many people are involved who have nothing to do with the CDU.
 But you explicitly discuss the CDU with them.
 If you were also involved with the SPD or the left or the Greens,
 then you would say, well ... I don't have a problem with advising the Greens or the FDP at all.
 I would also advise the SPD, which has not asked in the last few years.
 You could just say, I don't advise anyone, I'm over it.
 No. So if someone asks me for advice, I'll come.
 Also the AfD, to be honest. For other reasons.
 I don't think the AfD is a democratic party in its current constitution and I don't do that.
 I'd be more careful with the left, even though I've done that before.
 Back then, I was asked by the opposition leader Bodo Ramelow in Thuringia when it came to legislation on direct public rights.
 But not as an economist?
 Well, as an economist who dealt with direct democracy.
 Because there are always economic problems of such political issues being discussed.
 And I then considered this as an economist and made a statement.
 But of course on this topic, on which I was asked.
 I know that the left would not ask me for minimum wage, for sure not.
 You were with the Socialist Party, you were a member of the SPD, are you now a member of any party?
 No.
 Your report you write, is that science?
 Yes, the reports themselves must be written in such a way that they are more general.
 Although, you know some of them, also from our meeting at the Federal Press Conference.
 I take it away from that now that you have at least looked at one or the other text building blocks.
 They are sometimes a bit harder to read.
 I have never read through the fat thing.
 I find that sad. You should.
 At least as long as I was there. I don't know if they are still so well formulated in the future. But that's just for fun.
 But it's the science you read.
 Yes, of course. You see very strongly, for example, we work with crass.
 We write a literature overview about what is in the literature about this topic.
 We give a quintessence in an overview, as we do in survey assignments on certain topics in scientific journals.
 Or we do our own analyses. For example, last year we did our own survey on the effect of the tax reduction of the turnover,
 this tax reduction of the value-added tax reduction that has been temporary.
 We have done analyses on the overhaul of the basic wage tax, for example.
 And from this, we then produce our own scientific papers that we process in these annual reports.
 And in this respect, I would say yes, there is science in it, absolutely.
 Do you work that? Do you work scientifically or are you, because you are the economic wise, letting your people work?
 Because the council has a lot of employees.
 So do you just say, here, let's do something about it, or do you research yourself and write everything yourself?
 I think you have to see that there is a wide field.
 Of course, we work together with a large staff.
 And then there are more or less separate parts. But if I stand on a piece of paper, then my share is sufficient that I have acquired it.
 Sufficient means?
 That I have written text building blocks, that I have participated in the question of how an empirical analysis is carried out.
 So I asked how do we approach it methodically, how do we best set it up, what problems arise here when we see certain results,
 that you have to ask yourself how robust they are, what robust analysis is to be carried out and
 similar. So that's what I've always done, I still do in my work.
 Assuming you have written a text building block, such an excerpt and Veronica Grimm,
 economically, or Achim Truger come and say,
 what the hell is this?
 Then we'll discuss it.
 The board of directors works like this.
 Do you find it a compromise?
 Or do you say, let's see what science says?
 No, you have to imagine it in the temporal dimension
 and on the other hand with division of work.
 That means that the different boards typically supervise different chapters,
 or at least parts of chapters.
 To supervise means that they write their own text files,
 they influence the analyses, they share them themselves
 and work with staff members and employees accordingly.
 And this with different focus positions in these dimensions.
 That's one side. That means we have a division of work and the chapter that someone
 answers is then discussed in the plenum. And on the timeline, not just once.
 This starts with a first version. The first version is already an extended
 section. That means you write down, we want to include in the principle, and add certain orientations to it.
 What that means for the analysis on the one hand and what it means for certain content on the other.
 So that you say, this is now in the discussion of this and that side, because of me, introduction of a wealth tax, there was already literature about this,
 these and those groups have positions and so on. So you can make this clear in such an expanded section.
 Then comes the first section in the next step, which may still have content gaps.
 Then comes the second section, which must be completely content,
 so that we can discuss the content as closely as possible.
 Then there is a third section, which must also be discussed in the formulations.
 And at the end, after there has been an internal control outside the board of trustees in the Statistical Board,
 so a quality control, that all the numbers are correct, that it is quoted correctly and so on,
 there is then not a plenary session with all five councils, but typically only with two, a correction read that means we then read the chapter again
 each before yes that is so to speak the six if you take the external quality control
 seven levels that that every chapter of the year review normally runs through
 that is, in the end veronica grimm also reads something and then you could still say, bullshit. If we're that far, what's written there should actually not be bullshit anymore.
 I have to be able to say in the second version that it's wrong in terms of content.
 I'm not saying bullshit, we're not saying that to each other.
 But they're young and naive.
 Yes, but, well, I mean, it's getting a little higher in the board of directors.
 I hope so.
 And it's getting a little more intense.
 Then it's not called bullshit, but nonsense or something.
 I mean, in the second version, the second content version really has to stand out completely.
 And I have to be able to say clearly that I think that's nonsense.
 Or I think it's wrong for this or that reason. And then we discuss it.
 Give us the last example where you said that's nonsense, you've discussed it. Wow, stupid.
 Well, in the last year's report we had an intensive discussion about pension policy.
 And Veronika and I didn't have any dissent, but the dissent, which later also reduced the minority vote, was between me and Achim Truger.
 And I fought hard in the discussion.
 Because you wanted the retirement age to be reduced again?
 No. I want the retirement age to be further increased.
 And Achim not?
 Achim not.
 And you couldn't agree?
 Exactly. We couldn't agree.
 Are there any scientific findings that people shouldn't let people work too long?
 I think that if you look at the different alternatives that are available to finance the demographic problems,
 especially now when you are in a phase where growth is becoming more difficult, also because of the demography,
 that it is not allowed to go in with too high costs, that it has too negative effects.
 And Arim's assessment is that it does not have too high negative effects.
 And he also says that we could achieve more productivity increases.
 On the one hand, that we can achieve more on the other hand through higher women's employment.
 And I think there are a number of calculations that we have already proposed in the board of directors several times,
 that this will make it easier for us, a higher women's employment, but not a solution to the whole problem.
 Could Achim be right?
 Achim could be right if we really take everything together that we can get from easing in the demographic.
 This also includes a higher immigration than we have today,
 so also a higher immigration than typically is in these demographic calculations of the Statistical Board.
 The argument is always that people are on average always older in our country
 and that is why the retirement of income should be increased.
 Otherwise the state would have to pay a pension for 30 years instead of 20 years on average like in the past.
 But then you say that there is a need for a upper limit for pension payments.
 Well, it's clear that there are also upper limits. We calculate what comes out of pension payments according to the pension formula. That means you have to have worked for a certain amount of time.
 It is also calculated according to the level of income you have achieved and the like.
 So that's why there is this complicated pension formula.
 So in that respect, the pension payments themselves are always limited and dependent on what you did before.
 On the other hand, the duration, the duration of the pension is not the goal size, but it is just an indication that we have spent more and more time in the retirement age in the many decades due to an expansion of the average have also favored for many years and which others also favor, is that. That's the idea. That means you would have to work longer, but only slowly, gradually over time and
 then still have at least on average a longer retirement period.
 And what you have to discuss there, which we also discussed in the last year's report,
 is the question of how this longer retirement period is distributed.
 There are also some who work in certain jobs and therefore also have a shorter retirement phase and
 don't have that much of it, those who are on average much much older are
 just those who have a different burden on their job during their working life and that is
 a difficult solution or a difficult question that years of work and 40 years of free time? That's too short for me.
 That's fair.
 No.
 Why?
 Well, because then those who work 40 years have to pay so incredibly much in taxes so that the others who are then still 40 years in retirement ...
 But that's a system of circulation.
 Yes, it's a great circulation system in which the younger ones are massively disadvantaged.
 Well, you can somehow regulate that.
 You could also think of a new system for the money that comes from the pension system.
 Where should it come from?
 Well, now officials and lawyers pay separately, capital payments are not included.
 You could make the pot bigger.
 Yes, we could, but that only brings more demands.
 And that actually doesn't help us in this demographic transition at all, because it runs until 2080.
 That means that employees like me, who hopefully have a longer life, at least on average, than other employees,
 that comes out when we look at the statistics, they then acquire claims in the pension insurance in the future
 and have more of it in this conversion process.
 That means that the younger ones are more burdened by the officials than anyway.
 Do you have to go to rest as an official at some point?
 I have to go to retirement at some point, exactly.
 When is that?
 At the age of 67. I have to go into retirement at some point. When is that? At 67 years old.
 Then it would be fair if you said retirement age, that you have to work longer.
 The problem with the professors is not that they don't want to work longer.
 It has always been the case that many of my colleagues...
 But if the professor says that people should work longer and at the same time you can do the luxury...
 I don't work longer, no problem.
 If you ask me personally, if I really get that old,
 I don't work until I'm 70.
 But the state has to send you to a standstill.
 Yes, the problem with the professors is really
 that most of them have to pull out of their offices
 so that you can see traces on the carpet.
 So from there...
 That will be the case with you too?
 Yes, I won't be able to afford that much resistance.
 How old are you now?
 I'm going to be 55 this year.
 Oh, then you still have time.
 Very nice, yes.
 Hopefully.
 You can work at it
 that even an official professor has to work until 70. Yes, I think. Ah, you still have time. Very nice, hopefully. You can work on it that a certified professor has to work until 70.
 Yes, I think that's right.
 Although I would not set the limit to simply say until 70, i.e. a fixed retirement age,
 but I would rather take the bond to the further life expectancy,
 i.e. the life expectancy that one has at 60 plus,
 in order to really develop what is developing in the course of time,
 which we also have for example of migration, employment and productivity,
 and to take that into account.
 If that is too rigid, I don't think it's right.
 I do think that we need to have a certain flexibility here.
 As a professor, are you allowed to have side income?
 Achim told me that you get money for your economic status.
 I think you get 37.000€ a year for that. Do you give that away? Do you donate it?
 Because you are not allowed to take it in?
 No, those are side income that I am allowed to realize.
 You have the possibility, that was a federal framework in the past,
 that you can use a fifth of your working time per week as a professor for side-effects.
 These are mandatory.
 And then, at some point in the 2006 federalism reform, it completely switched to the countries.
 There are also differentials.
 Officers in Hesse are treated differently than officers in Baden-Württemberg.
 In Baden-Württemberg there is no limitation in the amount of the additional income that you can realize.
 Cool, then you can hold many expensive presentations.
 Yes, that also depends on what you want to do and how much you are committed to it.
 I hear you are very hardworking, investment banker and so on.
 I am hardworking there, but I am also hardworking elsewhere.
 What do you get for a presentation at an investment bank?
 That depends on what it is.
 What did you ask for last time?
 At the moment, only these virtual events take place and then it is 3.000, 3.500 for a presentation.
 Do you earn more in addition than as an official?
 No.
 So even the income through the economic process is included? Even included, of course.
 Do you save? Do you pay?
 I think I even signed a Riesda contract at the time. But that's very simple.
 So if it's private, say it.
 Also there is division of labor, the financial decisions at our home meet
 my wife much more than I do.
 Really?
 Yes.
 The economist gives the ...
 Yes, absolutely.
 What's going on there?
 My wife is much more economical and future-oriented than I am. I
 always liked to celebrate in the past, we just I am. I used to like to celebrate, we just found out.
 Do you still like to celebrate?
 Yes, I mean, of course it's not as possible as it used to be.
 You're not the youngest anymore.
 Not in the pandemic, but ...
 Not in the pandemic either, but ...
 You have to invite me sometime.
 I'll do that, gladly.
 If you hang out with a party like you, then we have to do something.
 If a real party comes up again, yes.
 If you hang out like you, then we have to do it. If a real party rises again.
 But you also have an advantage as chairman of the business department.
 You are probably invited everywhere.
 With the lectures.
 Well, it depends.
 I mean, if you give a lecture and let it be granted, then the exchange relationship is clear.
 So you present, for example, a customer presentation for a bank, in which you discuss and describe the economic situation based on the year's budget and beyond.
 And in return there is a return. A very normal relationship.
 Where do you not take money?
 At political foundations I usually don't take money.
 If so, they only have small compensation of 500 euros or something.
 I don't take money from political parties when they invite me.
 I don't take money from student organizations, student congresses,
 from research seminars. I have also regularly presented the annual reports to universities.
 So my presentation is already very, very intensive and covers basically the entire range of schools, universities, service clubs like Rotary, Lions or Zonta,
 up to scientific lectures, which of course are not provided at scientific conferences.
 You actually pay a fee for the day and provided lectures at customer lectures.
 Good. We don't have that much time left.
 I could probably do five hours with you.
 Maybe you'll have to come back at some point.
 Hans will come back with your questions to Lars Feld.
 I have a few more current questions.
 You have short-time worker's money.
 You said the world in September 2020.
 I quote,
 the short-time worker's money as a short-term support instrument was right.
 The extension of 24 months to the end of 2021 is, in my opinion, too long.
 The cleaning forces of the market are being pushed back too much. It does not help to bind work and capital into companies that no longer have a viable business model.
 I understand that the parties want to prevent a rapid increase in unemployment rates before the Bundestag election, but that is not an economic category for me.
 Why is the springy increase in unemployment not an economic category?
 What is not an economic category in this quote is the interest in the Bundestag election.
 In my opinion ...
 But it was understood that the increase in unemployment is not an economic category.
 That may be, but that's not what I thought.
 The election itself is not an economic category for me.
 It's a political category.
 And the question of extension, you always have to see in what context I made or do such statements.
 It was about the extension at the time and it was discussed with which additional conditions this extension should come.
 And it was important to me to point out that we have the problem with structural change, that you should not simply bind the workers in the companies that do not have chance of survival in the end. And what the politics then did, it did not simply take the extension as it was intended,
 but it made sure that from this second quarter on,
 you also have qualifications and that you have to prove them from July on,
 if you want to have a short-time worker's salary.
 And I felt that in view of my criticism as a reasonable compromise.
 And so we wrote that down in the annual report.
 But isn't it understandable that the political parties,
 which eventually level the politics,
 worry about the possibility of a high unemployment,
 if they impose the short-time employment?
 Well, the question is always what happens
 if we just let the short-time employment continue action? Well, the question is always what happens if we just let the short-time wage go on,
 whether the damage is not greater afterwards.
 We also had a phase in which the short-time wage did not work as well as after the financial crisis.
 Damage to the labor market, so for the employees.
 If they would not be fired?
 Well, look at the reunification.
 We have set up short-time wage, short-time wage zero, over a long period of time, relatively generously.
 It wasn't cheap. We should have stopped earlier with it. We should have stopped earlier with the other labour market policies so that people actually got jobs.
 And we actually only did that with the reforms of the Schröder government, bringing people back into jobs. And that is the key point in the labor market. To keep them in short-time worker regulations or in employment measures,
 as the things used to be called, that doesn't help. That doesn't bring the employees anything
 and the employees who are in there don't either. And it doesn't bring
 the overall development of the economy. So you always have to see that it's not always about the short-term memories.
 We saw that in 2008 and 2009 the regulations of the short-term wage were favorable.
 That helped. We got through the crisis well.
 We then also cashed the generous decisions on the short-term wage
 and then it went very well in the labor market in the weeks, in the months and years after.
 But after the reunification it was not so cheap.
 But now the pandemic is something different than reunification.
 Absolutely, the pandemic is something different, but we still know, first of all, we did not know from the beginning how long the pandemic was going on.
 Secondly, we still do not know what effects the pandemic will have structurally.
 So will it be like this afterwards that we have fewer flights, so that the airfares are better occupied on the train? Or does that have such a great effect
 that in the end 40 percent of the employees are in the home office? And so on. So that means
 we are of course also asking questions about the structural changes that will immediately have a
 further effect after the Corona pandemic, through the Corona pandemic.
 In the same interview you said, because we talked about the debt break earlier,
 if you take away the debt break, you say, you signalize the financial markets,
 we do not have the demography in our country in control.
 That would make debt expensive.
 Why do we have to signal to the financial markets?
 Because the financial markets are the ones that refinance us. The money that we take away from debts comes from the financial markets. Because the financial markets are the ones that refinance us.
 The money we take on debt comes from the capital markets.
 We are dependent on the financial markets.
 We are dependent on the moneymakers. Let's put it that way.
 Let's not say it so abstractly, but financial markets are an abstract construct.
 They are moneymakers.
 They are private companies.
 Banks, they are banks, they are private people who buy state loans, there are funds.
 Then we make ourselves very reprehensible as a state to these actors.
 Whenever you make debts, you make yourself reprehensible in a certain way.
 You have to be able to serve them.
 Or you think about making debts to someone else, that you organize it differently. Yes, but you always have to see what the market conditions are and who is
 lending money to you in good conditions. That is no problem for the federal government at the moment.
 He earns money with it when he makes debts. He even gets a negative interest.
 We are privileged as Germany.
 We are privileged as Germany. Others do not have this privilege,
 for example the United States does not, although they offer the world reserve currency.
 They have to deliver positive interest rates.
 So that depends on the conditions.
 And of course you can say I don't want the financial markets, then you go to a decent credit high, but usually requires higher interest rates.
 But why do we signal the financial markets when we take away the debt, that we don't have our demography under control?
 That we don't have the demographic problem under control? I don't even know if I have demography,
 did I authorize demography?
 My concern is indeed that the politics
 takes the pandemic as an excuse to eliminate the debt break.
 That would be completely wrong from my point of view.
 If you take away the debt break,
 you signalize the financial markets,
 we don't have the demography in our country under control.
 We make debts, we expropriate.
 So that's a mistake.
 It's not like we don't have the demography in control. We can't have it in control.
 It's running anyway. But the financial problems that arise from the demography.
 And in general we signal the financial market participants,
 whether the solidity of the past years still applies or whether you have to demand higher interest rates from Germany.
 I have another quote, again from the world, so there are obviously interviews from the world.
 You also said again about the topic of state-belief, the world has asked. In Germany, the trust in state-based capabilities has always been great, while the market economy is seen as rather skeptical.
 Only in bad times, when big problems arise, the willingness of citizens to make market-based reforms increases.
 Then the world asks, is there a chance for market-based renewal in the current crisis?
 And you say yes, if politics uses the difficult economic cycle to raise the willingness raise the reform readiness of the population exactly what do we have to reform now
 well we have a whole series of challenges that are in place we have now
 just talked about the demography that is a challenge and there we have to reform
 so we have to reform a pension age upwards exactly so with this regulation as I
 formulated we have the climate protection we have already talked about climate protection, we have also talked about it. Increase CO2 prices.
 But that has already happened. What is the market economy doing?
 It is a very low price.
 Oh, it has to go higher.
 I say yes, it has to go higher.
 It has to go higher and then you have to see on the other side that we are coming to international agreements.
 That is now a transition solution for sectors that are not covered by EU's emission trading system in Germany. A transition solution. This must also be extended throughout the EU to these other sectors
 that are not yet covered in the EU. And we must have a worldwide solution in the sense of a climate club.
 Especially with the USA. I also think with China. So climate protection. I have a demographic.
 We have to do a lot with regard to technical progress, i.e. We have to make some progress in terms of technology, so in terms of digitalization.
 I know that we need infrastructure investments and the like, specifically within the EU and the European Monetary Union.
 And there is also a lot at stake that Germany has to influence, which Germany has to ensure that we will eventually get a good result.
 You described the problems, but what does that mean? What reforms are necessary?
 Market-economic reforms?
 Well, again, with the demographic, that's a different age. With climate protection, a sharper CO2 pricing and international agreements.
 With the issue of digitalization and technical progress, increasing Germany's innovation capacity.
 And innovation means the implementation of new ideas that we have in the field of research and development into marketable products.
 And we can see that Germany has problems.
 To found startups, to bring startups forward in the growth phase and to ensure that we have innovation.
 We are behind states like the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland.
 And a whole range of changes are necessary.
 If you look at how difficult it is to implement innovation and investment in Germany,
 both state and private,
 a narrow range of regulations that prevent investment for a long time
 or push it to the long run,
 then we don't have to address the problems of the Berlin airport.
 We can also talk about the expansion of rail traffic on the Rheinschiene,
 if it is about state investment.
 But we can also talk about the construction of the new stadium of SC Freiburg. Or we can talk about investments that were
 wanted to be carried out in the field of gene technology from BASF, but then
 have taken place in the USA, because we have restricted it.
 In terms of climate protection, the CO2 level is now only falling in terms of market economic
 Reform. Do you need a few regulations or a few bans so that the economy
 can renew? You could say to industry could say, listen up,
 from 2030 no more new fuel will be allowed.
 You are already on the track anyway.
 First of all, you don't need someone like me
 who says everything is great,
 even if I don't think it's great.
 I think we really only achieve what we want
 when we go up significantly in terms of CO2 pricing.
 But aren't there any other necessary regulations,
 requirements, future bans?
 You could also tell Lufthansa, we'll save you,
 but 2035 should make sure you're only climate neutral.
 I don't think about most of the bans in this area.
 Which bans do you hold?
 You can't be Radikalinski and say that all prohibitions are bad. Of course not.
 Give me a prohibition that still needs it.
 For example, we have a prohibition of FCKW emissions. That helped.
 But what does it need in the future?
 But what does it need in the future? So for climate protection, it will need the CO2 pricing in the future. We don't need
 any bans that ban the combustion engine or the like.
 I was also with Ottmar Edenhofer, who says that this is not,
 this cannot be the only instrument. You probably know that, he is also an economist.
 Yes.
 Give me another ban, what ban on reforming our economy.
 We have a whole range of regulations and requirements that we have set up for climate protection.
 And we see the problems that are caused by it.
 Also the reaction to evasion that is caused by it.
 I don't think there are many of the bans in this area above all, we have to add something to what we already have.
 I think you really have to rely on the price instrument.
 And I can't imagine that Ottmar Edenhofer sees it differently.
 I think I know that he sees it the same way.
 But he doesn't just say CO2 prices.
 Did he name you a ban?
 Several, you have to look.
 I wanted to know if you can tell me one.
 Burner ban?
 No.
 Good. Lars, thank you very much for your time.
 Please come back again.
 I'd love to.
 Maybe in another round, a big round.
 We want to continue after the pandemic.
 It's currently a bit difficult.
 And now I'm curious what the audience wanted to know.
 Hans.
 With pleasure.
 So, because many always mock and wonder about it,
 what does he come up with with his notes?
 Dear people, there are situations where handwritten on paper is simply the most efficient form of information storage and communication.
 So that was a pretty broad mixture of questions about subjects and questions about details. One question was asked several times, you already mentioned it, is economics for you actually science, natural science or social science?
 You have already indicated that you do not see it as natural science.
 No, of course. In my opinion, the economy is a science, that is important, that is also questioned by some.
 We work scientifically, with the idea, as we have it in critical rationalism, that we develop theories.
 They don't have to be mathematical, they are just arguments, sentences, as Karl Popper wrote,
 which you set up and make empirically verifiable.
 And then also empirically verifies.
 And that's exactly how we work in economics.
 In this respect, we are a science, but it is a social science.
 That means we take care of ourselves by taking care of economic issues,
 partly beyond that, political or social,
 about the social.
 That is the object we are analyzing.
 And social sciences are also different from natural sciences,
 because we can build to a lesser extent,
 as it is statistically called, on the law of the large number.
 This means, there was a follow-up question,
 if it is social science,
 doesn't economics automatically have parts of ideology.
 And ideology is not used as a negative term, but as ideas and thought structures that are based on this scientific knowledge and their methods.
 Ideas and thought structures always the brain, we know that. But what you see in the course of time is that they have become less important.
 That we get a mainstream that is pragmatically aligned and actually always goes ahead in these smaller steps.
 So science is often just a sequence of small steps. That you have a certain question that theoretically resulting, which has also occurred in practice,
 where one says that the connection should be causal and then we check it empirically.
 And especially the empirical examination is something that forces you to get rid of the thought structures
 and to see what it looks in reality. But isn't it, the school to which you would orientate yourself, if I understand this correctly,
 so autoliberalism in a modern form,
 doesn't build on the idea that it would make sense to make as few concrete regulations as possible for the actors of the economic process as few concrete guidelines as possible,
 but to let them act.
 That's a bit of an ideology, an idea of what is good and right in the running.
 So autoliberalism or orderly economics means to make economic policy rule-oriented.
 That does not mean with as few restrictions as possible,
 as you have now formulated, but that means with reasonable restrictions.
 So to ask, how do I have to set the framework conditions
 to get a good result?
 Eucken has formulated it nicely, it is about creating a human-worthy order.
 Yes, but exactly, human-worthy.
 And there are also a whole series of follow-up questions
 that refer to the fact that you said
 we don't have an ecological crisis,
 so no climate crisis,
 but we can handle all of this.
 We have instruments.
 They say, sorry,
 we have already had global warming.
 We are now fighting to reach the 1.5 degree target.
 Hardly anyone thinks that this is still to be achieved.
 We are in the middle of a crisis.
 What kind of crisis term do you have, is asked,
 if you call it a crisis only when the poop is steaming
 and the cart hangs on the wall.
 Yes, that is a crisis term.
 I think many would share it.
 So if we go back to medicine, for example,
 I just said that I was working as a caretaker in psychiatry,
 then we also take the crisis as a phenomenon
 that actually only occurs during the collapse.
 So then when the difficulty is there.
 And typically you try to heal in the next step and do something about it.
 Of course, this can be so serious crises as the climate crisis can become,
 can it be that we can no longer correct it.
 That means, as long as I still have the opportunity to preventively change something in advance
 so that it doesn't get worse and we don't have the collapse, then I think we are not yet in the crisis.
 But is the work, as you understand it, of the economist, also of the political economist, who you are, also controlled by the fact that he says we have to recognize crisis symptoms early on and see that we can preventively counter-control a time when the crisis is about to break out.
 Is that the task?
 Yes, we have to recognize in advance what is happening to do something about it,
 so that we do not get such a collapse of the systems.
 What does that mean? That was also a direct question of the following for the crisis we are in.
 The pandemic is directly linked to an economic question.
 How is the No-Covid approach to evaluating the economic and scientific perspective? Three weeks of a hard lockdown and then we can open again compared to what we have had for a year.
 A bit of a lockdown. Where is the damage and the benefit greater?
 That's a more difficult question.
 On the one hand, I have tried to make it clear throughout this Corona pandemic that there is no simple simple goal conflict between economy and health.
 So you have to see very clearly that the health impacts that we have in the
 pandemic would lead to people staying at home even without lockdown, also losing a lot more
 trust and the economic activity would not go on. And we see
 this, for example, also in Sweden. We also see it in historical investigations of other pandemics in the past. So there is no such simple goal conflict.
 What is best done economically is a good anti-pandemic policy.
 So on the one hand to say we are trying to keep the infection rates as low as possible in the waves
 so that our health system does not collapse, i that the intensive care facilities are not overcrowded and that triage decisions are made.
 Because this was really asked, a certain time in the reopening,
 both medically, ethically and economically the right one.
 Yes, I have used myself for this, although you always have to ask again with which instruments.
 So unlike what we had last year, Clemens Fuest now also encouraged the no-covid strategy in this no-covid group, not the border closure.
 And that means, of course, that we could continue to maintain our internationalized value chains.
 That means that this would not belong to this no-covid strategy that we close the industry.
 So not zero covid, no covid is something else.
 Exactly.
 So you are for no-Covid. Absolutely. That means, of course, that I have also emphasized in the discussions, even in the past days, how important, in my opinion, a barrier of exit from higher incidences, i.e. for example an incidence of 100, is.
 And that it can be effective, which we have also seen in various contexts.
 So much that it is currently still empirically disputed. I believe that we would already be able to move forward with such a barrier.
 It was asked about minimum wage, destroy jobs, did not occur.
 Did this lead to a change in your way of thinking?
 No, so again, I have argued against the minimum wage and said that there is a danger that it will cost massive jobs in the interview.
 After that, in the annual report in which we rejected the minimum wage from the board of directors, a prognosis was included that we had made how much the minimum wage would cost in 2015. This is based on 100,000 employment conditions.
 And if you look at the studies that have been conducted today,
 you will find that about 100,000 employment conditions have been lost due to the minimum wage.
 But in view of the very good financial development, this did not play a role at all, because we
 have had so many additional employment conditions in other
 contexts. In this respect, I am always very clear about the prognosis
 and say that the prognosis we made back then was not
 wrong. What I focused on in the interview,
 is also in this rejection of the minimum wage in the annual report,
 if we get a politically driven minimum wage that is set higher and higher,
 and then also more and more working conditions are established that are then no longer profitable for the employer,
 then we also get higher unemployment.
 And that's exactly the problem that I don't want to have.
 At this point I remain critical.
 Today I am also critically critical of a minimum wage of 12 euros, from now to the same time.
 But on the other hand, in the minimum wage commission, the scientists are only advisory and not decisive,
 we have set aside that we now get this increase in the two years from 2020 to the end of 2021,
 which have been cancelled and which will also include a stronger increase in the coming year.
 There is a question in connection.
 Would you be for a reduction or a drastic reduction in the termination of protection if it was linked to minimum wage,
 which would compensate for the situation of income and security of existence.
 I do not think the minimum wage is a good social policy instrument.
 I think that in a system, it would make sense to go to Germany,
 where we have less suspension on the one hand and more social security on the other.
 But this should then be realized by the unemployment insurance and not by the minimum wage. I think that the minimum wage can be a market-based political instrument,
 especially in the case of regional market power by employers is corrected by the minimum wage.
 We have that again and again, especially in the service well. And that has a very good function and can work.
 And if we succeed in moving forward with the independent minimum wage commission,
 from the governance perspective,
 then I think we can live well with the minimum wage in the future.
 So, minimum wage only as an instrument against the worst consequences of the predator capitalism?
 Yes, against the black sheep that are there on the spot, exactly.
 Yes, some herds consist of black sheep predominantly, we sometimes think.
 Good. It was then also asked about the topic, so minimum is an important category.
 Global minimum taxes are in the discussion. Good? Not good? Yes, I think that the minimum taxes are still an instrument that is at least harmful to international taxation.
 So Biden seems to have gone into the right direction.
 Yes, and the Americans have already introduced a minimum tax under Trump.
 What Biden is now suggesting is a relatively high minimum wage,
 which in my opinion will not be realized.
 Because there are far too many countries that are against it,
 which have much lower body tax rates.
 I think that tax competition can have positive effects.
 I have analyzed this since my dissertation,
 both in the national environment in Switzerland
 and internationally in various contexts.
 And that's why I think that the developments we have there have to be more specific.
 And we will have a certain basic problem with a minimum wage,
 which has been around for decades, maybe even centuries, in international taxation,
 and we can't just solve it. not simply solve and that is that certain tax oases that are protected by
 particularly strong countries, the UK and the United States, that these tax
 oases cannot be dried from the outside. Ultimately, the protection that the British and
 the Americans offer these tax oases is too great. An oasis like the Cayman Islands would not work without Great Britain.
 We can say the same at other places. That's why I always find this discussion about international
 taxation a bit wrong in a way. Because you are wrong and the expression does not catch my attention.
 It's a kind of hypocrisy that takes place there. The Brits always liked to participate in tax harmonization.
 Inequality.
 Yes, inequality is perhaps a very good expression. Always liked to participate in tax harmonization,
 but always made sure that they were not really affected by it.
 And I think that's the point we have to address. Ultimately, we are now doing worse with a Great Britain outside the EU.
 Because the Brits will try to achieve their advantages that they seek to
 acquire for their economic system outside the EU with more tax competition. What do you say to the thesis that the forecasts regarding growing inflation, also due to growing debt from states, have always been wrong in the past? It's not correct to say that, because of course it would always mean that we are historically
 going back in time and that doesn't work. In the last 20 years.
 In the last ten years I would admit that this is the case. But that also has a lot to do with the fact that
 it has been underestimated how badly the banking system has come out of the financial and banking crisis. And there are also long-standing analyses that say, well, after a banking crisis,
 the systems are already very vulnerable and until we get to inflation, it takes quite a long time.
 So until the problems in the bank balance sheets are cleared, it takes a long time.
 We have had that in the Union of Stock Exchange.
 While the United States, which have cleaned quickly and more consistently cleaned up their banking system, both in management and in the balance sheets, have returned to higher inflation rates earlier.
 Which are still very modest.
 They are still at 2%, but of course that was also because the monetary policy has not become much more relaxed. That is now different. So both the monetary policy and the financial policy in the USA are now quite different.
 So that you should not be weighing yourself on the other side now, that the inflation phenomenon does not occur.
 The economic theory for which you represent is, I think, still connected with the claim to growth. There was the concrete question of how one can imagine economic growth,
 since we have an ecological limitation of resources on the other side.
 The limitation of resources is the actual phenomenon that economists deal with.
 It's about scarcity and the question of how to deal with scarcity.
 This is how an introduction to the teaching of economics begins, if it's done well.
 So it's nothing new at all that it's about limiting resources and the question of how to deal with it.
 One problem that we have to address in terms of growth is how does growth come about at all?
 Growth is much, much less resource consumption consumption than it was 20 years ago.
 Relatively.
 Relatively seen, of course.
 Absolutely, it's more.
 Relatively seen.
 And the resource, is the relationship actually the same?
 What we mainly achieve in growth is an improvement in the quality of our standard of living.
 And we see that as resource-saving.
 We just talked about it, Thilo and I. I come from the Saarland.
 That is an area that has been very strongly based on the motor industry.
 When I was a teenager in the 70s, early 80s, I outside for a week and turned the town hall,
 there was always a nice thick layer of coal from the nearby coal power plant on the window sill of our house.
 It's not there anymore for 30 years. Because we're going through completely different conditions.
 So the key point is how do I achieve the standard of living through an increase in quality, which is ultimately also growth-related, and to proceed with a resource-saving approach.
 For example, this can be recreated.
 And that does not logically correspond with the claim to growth that is still represented by you.
 You don't say, or I didn't hear and read that, you don't say growth only as far as the absolute of the resource does not exceed.
 No, we're not going that far.
 Yes, but the question is, if we discuss this in the long term,
 in view of the question of when the resources are so exhausted that our Earth cannot survive anymore.
 For example, at 2. how many degrees?
 Yes, but then we are at a very specific point.
 And at 2. so and so many degrees ...
 I mean, I can of course try to set quite general demands in a great design
 of circular economic ideas of the post-growth movement to make quite general demands.
 I think that in my opinion this brings zero to the problem solution, if not even negative.
 When we talk about the two-degree goal, then we ask very specifically how we can achieve that.
 And then I say, let's get to a CO2 price of 100 euros per tonne as soon as possible,
 then we save CO2 and have a chance to reach the 2 degrees.
 We will also need an international agreement for this.
 It will not go without.
 And we will also have to have accompanying measures so that the public industries are not damaged too much,
 so that we can move forward with new technologies, hydrogen and so on.
 But that is a very specific task and it is much more important to me at this point.
 In terms of circular economy, I have now become more or more open in this respect,
 because I think that we can now come to more concrete ideas on how to implement them,
 than we tried 20 years ago.
 Also with sanctions?
 Yes, of course we also need sanctions for that. That would be bans? than we tried 20 years ago. Also with sanctions?
 Of course we need sanctions for that.
 That would be bans.
 No, I mean, a ban always means an claim of absolute authority.
 I can understand and sign the ban on nuclear energy very well.
 I am always very careful very careful with other prohibition provisions.
 So I think you have to try to solve the goal conflicts in a
 decision-making process as far as possible, while a ban always has an
 absolute claim. I would not necessarily want to define circular economy in the sense of a ban,
 but if we move in this direction,
 then we can bring regulations and thus promises that can bring us in this direction.
 Two last questions.
 Armin Laschet is now probably accepted by Söder, Chancellor candidate of the Union.
 If he were to ask you, would you like to become an economic minister, yes or no?
 There is no such thing? Yes or no? There is not just a yes or no either.
 Oh.
 No, the point is simply that ...
 Maybe.
 Yes, exactly. There is always a maybe and at the end maybe a assessment.
 I have to say, I don't really feel like going into politics.
 First of all, my job as a professor at the university is much more important and much more pleasant.
 And on the other hand, if it is specifically the Ministry of Finance, then I would probably reject it.
 Because the possibilities of design in the Ministry of Finance are relatively small.
 The economic and political possibilities of design are in the Ministry of Finance. Ah yes, that would be more interesting for you. But that's the party again, possibly, who knows.
 No, we don't know how the federal government is. as a liberal social person for the legalization of cannabis.
 Would that have an economic impact, a benefit or disadvantage?
 Can you calculate that?
 Yes, I find it difficult to calculate, but I have always used myself for the legalization of cannabis
 early on.
 So my fascination, as described by my first teacher, Werner Pommerene,
 arose from him using himself for the liberalization of drugs. And at that time his idea was not only to use cannabis, but to continue. As described by my first teacher, Werner Pommerene, it was because he used drugs to liberalize himself.
 And at that time his idea was not only to use cannabis, but to go further.
 I found it interesting to see this economically argued.
 Alcohol?
 Alcohol is already liberalized anyway.
 Of course we could talk about what it brings if we tax it, just like we tax other sins,
 like the alcohol taxation, which exists in different dimensions.
 What this then offers possibilities if you had such a control of cannabis instead of a ban on trade and so on.
 So these are all things we can discuss.
 There are also certain health benefits that are already possible to use. You could also make it more specific, but in my opinion it is
 on the other hand also a drug that causes relatively little damage. But I am
 carefully weighing. I have also experienced in my time in psychiatry that there are drug psychoses
 that have been caused by excessive consumption of cannabis. So it's not easy for me to stand behind the flag of liberalisation of drug consumption.
 I think that the paths are typically in the middle.
 Lars, thank you for answering the questions.
 Thank you for your interest and your time. You know how to support this format.
 You can see a few names that have done this in the past month in the video.
 See you next time. Bye.
 Bye, all the best.
 We stay now for another minute. Thank you. Thank you. you
