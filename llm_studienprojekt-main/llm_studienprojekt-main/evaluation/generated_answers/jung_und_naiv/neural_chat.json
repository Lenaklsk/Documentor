      "The The German Bundestag The German Bundestag The German Bundestag\n The German Bundestag\n The German Bundestag\n The German Bundestag\n The German Bundestag\n The German Bundestag\n So, a new episode of Jung Naiv. I have a new guest. Who are you?\n My name is B\u00e4rbel Baas and I am the Federal President.\n What is the president of the German Bundestag? Yes, many say the head of the German Bundestag, but that's just a term.\n Because I'm not really a head.\n Why not?\n Because I would wish I could decide everything, but that's not the case.\n Yes, then you would be a dictator or something.\n Right, exactly. And I'm not. I was elected democratically by the members of parliament.\n And my main task is to lead the session.\n Many people know that, because they see me when I lead the session.\n But behind that is a big federal government.\n I am the head of that.\n The federal government has a total of 3,000 employees.\n A director helps me with that.\n A director of administration, so I don't have to do it alone.\n And the other thing is of course the representative tasks,\n that I represent the German Bundestag from the outside.\n We'll have to discuss everything, so that a little light comes into the dark.\n I think many people just don't know what a Bundestag president does.\n That's true.\n And you are even the second highest person in the German state by protocol. Yes, in the ranks of the constitutional organs I am number two behind the\n Federal President and in front of the Chancellor. Why is that?\n Yes, because I think the Federal President is the first\n head of state and the second institution elected by the people is the\n German Bundestag, which represents the people.\n Therefore a second place.\n And the third place is the government, the chancellor, the federal council and the federal constitution.\n Because the Bundestag elects the chancellor who sets up the government.\n Simple explanation. And not the other way around.\n But you're not the housemaster in the Bundestag who has a key to every room and every door?\n For God's sake, no I don't.\n But you have... I mean, of course you have...\n No, but I have the right to the house. So if that's a question, I also determine the access regulations.\n But there are also the committees for that. So we have, for example, one committee, which are the security officers.\n Every faction appoints an official who deals with security issues in the house.\n We have adjustments to the house order again and again, even if certain things happen, access.\n We had a small storm on the Bundestag, that was 2020, I think at the end of a corona demo.\n And then security measures are checked again and again, whether the house is safe, who comes into the house. These are rules that determine the house owner.\n Can you do that in a partial way? I don't want left-wing extremists or people of the last generation to have rights.\n No, no, that's why I just said there is a board of directors, that are the security officers, who consult with the federal police and the administration.\n I can make suggestions, as I imagine it, but the members of the board, who work as security officers for the factions,\n it's also about the safety of the members of the board in the house, they discuss these suggestions and then make a recommendation for the oldest council,\n or in that sense for me, by then renewing the house order. Could you say, I don't want any more lobbyists in the house?\n Because that disturbs our work or something.\n So lobbyists, I know that's always a hot topic, but we are being consulted by many experts.\n Of course, in that sense, they are all lobbyists.\n So I'll say, from the German Federal Trade Union, and Welfare to individual companies that operate in the house.\n To exclude that would block the house.\n But it's important that these things are transparent.\n That you know who is talking to whom.\n And we started to make it clear with the clear which organizations are moving in the house.\n Are you satisfied with that?\n No, not quite yet. I think we have put it in motion. It was important that transparency comes in first.\n We will get information from many outside and we will adjust and check it again and again."

My question is actually in the direction of the disinterest that Albrecht mentioned, the West Germans in the East., but what I see is a continuous crisis on all levels.\n Capitalism, globalization, digitalization, and 30 years in which East Germans were told that they only had to adapt and only have to do enough.\n And then you can do it just like in the West.\n And this experience after 30 years to say that they are still there,\n most of them have left, they say now, well, then we'll just take everything off.\n And you don't give us an answer to the crises that are coming.\n We have already experienced crises.\n My colleague tells me, for example, well, if it means now that we don't have any plastic bottles anymore,\n then we'll just wash the glass bottles again.\n That's not a problem either. Or we take the can bags with us again.\n That's not an issue. We're old enough to have experienced that.\n So we'll make this adjustment again.\n But these deep rejections of these crises that are there, I think, also play a big part in it.\n And I don't think that West Germans understand on a political level that these rejections and the election of the AfD are in common.\n And that it is actually a symbol that we are not living in a deep crisis of democracy, but of capitalism.\n Did you want to react to that, Albrecht? Otherwise we'll continue.\n Hi, who are you?\n I'm Timo.\n Hi Timo.\n Nice name.\n I was born in the West, but half of it, is not Muslim, but I am from Iran.\n I moved to East Berlin 13 years ago, so I lived most of my time in the former east.\n I think that's why, you could say I'm a special case in the sense of the system,\n that I don't count in the mass, but I have to say, I'm very historically oriented.\n And my thing is, we have now said what is it with the 30 years and now there is a crisis of capitalism.\n So I can only say from a historical perspective, there are not the West Germans, I think, and there is also not what has now been said, there is also not the East Germans.\n And I think that is very important in the sense that, what was said, 17 percent of the West Germans were never in the East.\n The question is, you could also ask how many percent of the East Germans were never in the West, so to speak.\n People could behave the same, no matter whether they come from the east or the west. And I think there is always a difference between what we expect, what we believe and what will happen.\n And I think that's the point. We try to work on the topic of the East and West all the time.\n But we can't do more.\n I think we can hardly\n look into the future and expect\n that what we try to do will also be implemented.\n And the most important thing is,\n like here, you talk about it,\n you can't expect that what we say,\n what is there for a chance, where can we go in, where can we now say, get in and do that, it will not be so implementable,\n that you have that awareness. I don't know if there are studies on this or so,\n I just know that history and science always says so to speak.\n Who are you?\n Hi, my name is Philipp, I don't have a podcast and I'm also on Twitter, Who are you?\n Hi, my name is Philipp. I don't have a podcast and I'm on Twitter.\n Since I'm glad you can see me live.\n What I like about the East is that there was no democracy.",

You still see it. There are different processes. I'm not the only one who has been there.\n If you look at what they did with actresses, like Sibyl Kekkeli and others, that's very serious. Yes, we are dealing with a boulevardization of the media landscape.\n In the past, the Bild newspaper was used as a symbol for something.\n Today, many others are on the same trip.\n So there has been almost an equalization.\n But still, you have to deal with it calmly.\n You should always judge this in a single case and in a single case, where fake news or falsifications take place, you should also enforce it accordingly.\n How do you inform yourself? What media consumption do you maintain?\n Well, I do what most people do.\n Nothing?\n I don't know. But in any case, most people I know have their mobile phone and tablet\n always running the Spiegel online.\n We have a permanent supply in the Bundestag with agency reports\n and a corresponding press Spiegel, which our press station always has at its disposal.\n I rarely read it, though, because I read three newspapers every day.\n That's the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, that's the Bild-Zeitung and that's the Berliner Zeitung.\n And then of course I also read the G\u00f6ttinger Tageblatt.\n Only when I'm in Berlin does it always take so long, so I read it online.\n I just wanted to ask if you also read the Keseblatt here too.\n Yes, of course. The G\u00f6ttinger Tageblatt is not a Keseblatt.\n I have to find a lance for the G\u00f6ttinger Tageblatt.\n We were at the Bild newspaper.\n They had this photomontage, this falsification,\n which told me I would go next to people who would pull a bolt cutter with a baton.\n The bolt cutter was the roof railing of a loudspeaker car and the bolt cutter was a hanging rope.\n This falsification was created by the G\u00f6ttinger Tageblatt.\n The picture came out with it and then the G\u00f6ttinger Tage Post was published. The picture was published and then the G\u00f6ttingen Daily Post showed the original photos.\n I was quite surprised, because I didn't know that I...\n But that was really good journalism, so I can't say anything bad about the G\u00f6ttingen Daily Post.\n Do you still watch television news, daily topics?\n I usually watch, if the time allows, the 21.45 from Heute Journal,\n that's why I recently saw this grandiose performance by Stefan Weil with Frau Slomka."

He acknowledges the existence of wars that may seem justifiable due to violence making sense in certain situations. However, he states that there isn't a just war, and he often finds himself making fun of and despairing over the naivety of people regarding these matters. He believes that humor may not be suitable for addressing complex issues like war, especially since humor might involve misunderstandings and simplifying the situation. Additionally, he thinks that humor is not possible without misunderstanding, and humor can sometimes be difficult to use effectively in situations that aren't easily reduced to jokes.",

      "So that's really the amazing thing. That's what I thought to take and deconstruct and make jokes out of the contradictions, the naivety, the overestimations.\n So, aspiration and reality is actually a significant part of my humor. This also has to do with the aspiration to formulate this greater goal of saving the world\n and at the same time not being aware of the complexity of the situation.\n These are things that create my humor. But don't you make satire or cabaret because you\n not only want to explain the world and have fun about it, but also want to improve it? Any form of questioning improves the world, because it forces people to think about it\n and because it forces them to question the solution and thus improve it.\n That's also a general claim that I think is way too high, to be honest. I mean, I also do journalism because I somehow believe in the good and hope that it is somehow heard or seen.\n Oh, it's nice that I can say as an old man now, that's a good thing.\n Yes? When does it get there? When do I have to expect it?\n I think then when the self-knowledge is so advanced that it recognizes the limits of one's own actions.\n When did you recognize it? advanced than that the limits of their own actions are recognized when you are\n recognized she is not I think not a specific time but I think that\n desillusion is a process of life I think the whole life is a process in which\n the questioning of what you once wanted, the improvement of your own thoughts, but also often of course,\n it also plays a role, so you learn to question more and more what you have done yourself.\n On the other hand, the mass of memories that you have, will become insurmountable at some point.\n Then an interesting process comes.\n Then you think you have knowledge that is based on experiences and thoughts that you can't remember anymore.\n And that is what you call a concussion.\n That's what old people often have.\n That they know exactly that they are right, but don't know why.\n And you have to be careful that this doesn't happen to you. And I work very hard on that.\n How?\n By always questioning my own doing. By considering that I could be wrong. That's actually a very essential thing in my work.\n So it's like the scientific search for the truth of a cabaret player?\n Of course. I work with footnotes and so on.\n You work with footnotes now?\n My texts have footnotes, yes.\n But only the written ones?\n Yes, of course, the written ones.\n Of course, sometimes...\n What I do on, the written ones. Of course, sometimes...\n What I do on stage is written text.\n Then there are always improvisations.\n That's extremely difficult today, because you can say that...\n It can be that you tell things that are not really thought through.\n And nobody lets that happen anymore today.\n Nobody lets mistakes happen anymore.\n You're dead. If you say something wrong today, you're dead.\n Killed, victimized.\n No, of course not dead.\n You're indisputable as a figure, so to speak.\n If you make a mistake,\n you make a small mistake and everyone is happy about it.\n That's where the whole discussion culture got a bit disgusting.\n Where a bit more tolerance or a bit more willingness to admit the other person's mistake could not harm anyone else.\n Is there a small mistake of yours that you are most annoyed about now, because it triggered a justified shitstorm?\n You already have a few, I hardly know anyone who has so many. Yes, that's true. A justified mistake was the story when I read in the newspaper that I have to do a show every week, so I deal with the current reports.\n And then came the report that these 100 lung doctors had calculated that stikoxide wouldn't be that bad.\n And then I had a text in the broadcast that dealt with it.\n And then it turned out that I had calculated these lung doctors.\n Only it is so that I have to rely on scientific sources.\n They weren't 100 conspiracy theorists, they were really 100 lung doctors.\n And when they get caught, then it fell on me, so to speak.\n And then there was a lot of hate and shitstorm. Oh, you dirty bitch, you told a shit about the fate of stikoxide and so on and so forth.",
      "We have been socialized totally as pacifists.\n And I believe that you cannot organize the world pacifistically\n as long as not all of us are pacifists.\n In this respect I would say, one has to ask the question, how do I stand with Afghanistan or how do I stand with the Iraq war?\n No matter if you reject it or not, but you can't just reduce it to the question, are you for or against war? That's unspeakable.\n There are those who say, war is generally violence and generally shit.\n Of course you can say against it, then you get hit in the face and mouth.\n Good, that's how it is.\n And then you can say, okay, there are wars that are just, where violence makes sense.\n There is no just war.\n I would signify that to this day, of course, there is none.\n But then I don't get Afghanistan and Iraq.\n Wasn't such a bad idea.\n No, there are situations where there is no justice.\n Yes.\n There are situations where you...\n The German likes to fall for this, when you tell him there is a problem and there is no solution.\n I think the problems of humanity are solved if there is one.\n It's like climate change.\n There are many questions about the people's rights.\n It's often not the question of where the right solution is and where the wrong one is,\n but rather which evil we take? For example, the fight against climate change brings an incredible amount of evil with it.\n An incredible amount. Poverty, destroyed existences will bring it with them.\n And making these decisions is very difficult and very delicate.\n And probably there won't be any that everyone will be satisfied with.\n And then they are often reduced to a good and bad decision.\n And that's exactly what I often make fun of\n and what I sometimes despair about in my private life,\n because I think that people are often very naive when it comes to these things.\n In Germany, we are still very often decided on good and evil.\n We are very moral in our discussion.\n I feel that in public discussions,\n that questions are solved morally\n and that then the question of power behind it\n is often just another nuance or something.\n But mostly it's the other way around.\n But do you deal with the topic of war in your cabaret?\n Not really.\n Why?\n There were things like that.\n Because there are topics that are hardly so easy to reduce that they are suitable for humour.\n Maybe that's it.\n I performed two days after September 11th in the Unterhaus in Mainz.\n I will never forget that. I talked about the attacks on September 11th for the first hour and a half.\n An incredibly difficult situation, but it didn't go any other way back then.\n You couldn't not talk about it and then there were serious parts in the program and then you could think about this kind of pacifism\n on the stage and then that gets into such a humorless\n running water of course at that moment too then the humor takes up a lot of the program\n very difficult situations There are situations that\n are not suitable for humor at all, because I also think that they are always\n too shortened in humor. I also shorten some things too much and that leads to\n misunderstanding. Yes, probably humor is not possible without misunderstanding.\n I grew up a bit with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert who were always making fun of Bush and the wars.\n There is nothing easier than a beautiful enemy picture.\n Trump was just wonderful.\n Trump was just, for four years everyone agreed in the rejection of a person.\n And, or rather, except those who were idiots.\n It was again something from the 70s, you knew where the good and the bad were.\n But it was right.\n Of course it was right. But the situation is usually not that simple.\n It was also clear at Bush, that it was an unjustified war, the Iraq war.\n Yes, rarely.\n It was just like that.\n What about arms exports? Is that a topic for you?\n Difficult topic. Very difficult. Not suitable for humor at all.\n You think so? I think there's so much fun in it.\n I think it's really difficult because...\n Especially...\n Especially with weapons...\n I don't know how to express it. Why I think it's so...\n ...so unscrupulous is because weapons are being built.\n The world won't get better because we don't build the weapons,\n because they're not being built in our country."

The Dutch were at that time, it has changed very much,\n you have to say. And that's something that fascinates me. Maybe we'll come to that later,\n how the world has completely turned around within a generation, also in the social one. But it was a very strict, a little stifling world. For example, her grandfather, where she lived, there was one bread with cheese and Because one bread is enough, right? It wasn't lack of money, it was just morality.\n And for my mother Waldorfschule was a liberation.\n That was a different world after this strict, Calvinist and very extreme experience she had.\n You have a Waldorfschule in Holland?\n Yes. There are them everywhere. Oh yes. They are everywhere.\n Okay.\n And there were many back then.\n And I felt less happy at my school time at the Waldorf school.\n I also think everything that is philosophically supported is complete nonsense.\n So even if I had children, I would certainly not send my children to a Waldorf school.\n But I went to school there.\n Your whole school time?\n I actually stayed there all my school time, until graduation.\n So you couldn't compare it to being at a normal school?\n No, I never went there myself. I had friends who were there. I was important in music at some point, because I was in a youth orchestra,\n and that was the orchestra of the high school, and I could compare how it went with them and what they did in class and so on.\n But that was another experience I had.\n As I said, not a bad one, but also not a super good one.\n What wasn't good? What didn't you like?\n Didn't you like it afterwards?\n No, I thought it was very...\n You know, there are the little differences between good intentions and the consequences. So for example, there was the idea,\n children in a class are also a social community\n and not just children who accidentally sit in a class.\n They should learn to help each other and to support each other\n and to get along with each other.\n Great idea.\n In practice, it was said that no one was allowed to stay seated.\n That means the progress of the class\n was always with the step of the dumbest or most lazy in the class. And with the most stupid or most lazy step in the class.\n And for the children who actually wanted to learn, who were interested in something, it was insanely frustrating.\n Then, well, we also had a youth orchestra at the school, but that was about the worst school orchestra in Germany,\n because to be a musician and to make and making art is wonderful and wonderful, but practicing would be a competition.\n Practicing is very difficult, and that's why the children have mostly brought their instruments once a week for the orchestra rehearsal out of the box, and that's how it sounded. And you know, there is this anthroposophical typology that a 14-year-old is at this level.\n Our school library was closed and when you came in, you were led to the shelf where age-appropriate literature was.\n Because Rudolf Steiner, who founded these schools, at some point 80 years ago said, a 14-year-old child is here in his development."

I am one of the founders and in the boardroom.

Because we currently\n adapt the children to the school. So we sort the children in such a way that they are capable.\n We should actually adapt the school to the children.\n But how does a school or a teacher know if you,\n even though you sit in a wheelchair,\n are less capable,\n so educationally, than a child who has no disability?\n He doesn't know that, but he starts sorting\n before he knows it.\n Because you have a disability?\n Because I have a disability, exactly.\n It doesn't make any sense at all.\n So I could be as good or bad in school as you.\n Except maybe in sport.\n Or maybe even better.\n Or maybe even better.

I had spoken about the program against long-term unemployment, for example.\n We are working, for example, we have used Rot-Gr\u00fcn very strongly for younger people through youth employment agencies and state-funded training.\n We didn't want to leave the school without a follow-up training.\n We started this as a model project and we think we need to do this now in a more comprehensive way.

It has\n split and is therefore\n no longer a faction.\n Are there Nazis in your...\n the AfD in Niedersachsen or are they still on the moderate side?\n They are Nazis in sheep's clothing, I would say.\n At the beginning they tried very strongly to get very civil in their speeches.\n That has now overcome itself. No, they are very right.\n And they will increasingly be more radical in their appearance and their statements, which candidates they put forward.\n Do they start with you?\n Not at all.\n Oh.\n So not at all.\n To be honest, you hardly see them.\n So they no longer play a role in the parliament, because obviously without this faction status they have disappeared.\n I thought now, if you hold a speech as a leader of the opposition,\n they would hit you in the head or something.\n No, not at all.\n Well, at least.\n And schools?\n Do you have air filters in every school in Lower Saxony by now?\n No, not really.\n Although I would like to say that air filters in the end ...\n Well, I think it makes more sense that we look at the fact that there are ventilation systems,\n because air filters are more of a support station.\n This often goes hand in hand in the debate. Air filters are something that can be put in in the short term.\n In fact, you would have to equip all schools with ventilation systems in perspective.\n How does that look?\n There are schools that have that. There are schools that have been built where the municipality then said at the end that it would be too expensive, we are now saving on the ventilation system, which does not have it, which must be urgently retrofitted.\n And our government is of the opinion that you do not have to invest in air filters or ventilation systems.\n In my opinion, this is short-sighted, not only because of Corona, but also because we are allowed to fear that there will be further pandemics and that infection protection will also play a role. And you are not going to a new government if no air conditioning systems are installed at every school?\n Is that a condition of yours?\n No, on the one hand we will enable the investments to be carried out through this investment fund.\n I would very much hope that municipalities will also build ventilation systems.\n That's the principle of hope.\n No, it's also the principle of making investments.\n We've seen how it's been going in the last decades.\n Yes, we will definitely demand, I think I've already made it clear, that there will be ventilation systems."

      "But to make it clear with another example, the development in 1968, which was a supposedly global revolution,\n as it was described as a world movement, nevertheless had extremely different variations in the different countries.\n So to give an example, and there is an interesting parallel,\n why did the states of Italy, Germany and Japan\n have this kind of radicalism\n in the terrorist movements?\n This also had to do with the past,\n their generation of the breakthrough.\n These are the three states,\n the trias, so to speak,\n who had the fascist strength.\n As global as it is global, it was immediately understood by the movement as world-moving.\n Of course, there were German moments of collapse in 1968, which are also to be explained.\n And I think, to make it clear, of course in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg we have a 15% AfD party.\n But the generation Gauland, maybe Mr. H\u00f6cke maybe slowly, but Mr. Meuthen knows anyway,\n with the type H\u00f6cke you would not have reached the 15% in the beautiful, brave Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n This type H\u00f6cke with his absolute anti-Semitism, with this vulgarity, has unfolded this effect unfolded in Thuringia. The AfD is currently in a very clever, very up-to-date process of Interestingly, with a concept of the end of the revolution, revolution 2.0,\n it was an East-specific that achieved these percentages.\n In the West, another strategy will be implemented, which is much more civilized, because it is connective.\n This speaks for the fact that it is very different, which you have to look at and which have a lot to do with history.\n And last but not least, of course, there can be a subsequent resistance,\n especially even of the younger generation. That's the interesting thing.\n That's the specific psychological phenomenon, Annette could say much more about it,\n that you also projectively get the coal out of the fire for the parent generation\n and do something later to maybe exculpate the parents.\n So there are phenomena of transmission, the subsequent generation, and do something in a later stage, to perhaps exculpate the parents.\n So there are phenomena of transfer,\n the later generations,\n for example also in 1968,\n in the fight against the occupiers,\n also the scorn of the parents\n a little bit tilting, who lost the war.\n So there are psychological phenomena\n that are so deep that you should not neglect them\n in all the justification of an\n eher systemic approach. But maybe once again said, the type H\u00f6cke is socialized in West Germany despite 68.\n So no, the question is how ...\n Because of 68 even.\n Well, but the question is actually, because the explanations we have in East Germany there was no 68,\n that's why it's so connectable.\n H\u00f6cke is socialized in West Germany despite 68.\n The other grantees, by the way, too.\n That means these thoughts are very rooted,\n also in a West German narrative.\n Yes, but not.\n We'll see how often Mr. H\u00f6cke will be in the future,\n for example, the next election campaign is in Hamburg.\n Let's wait and see what the National Assembly election in Hamburg brings for the AfD.\n So I want to say that already 90. I still have the pictures in front of my eyes,\n there was the pretty smart Nazi Bela Althans, maybe one or the other can still remember him, from Munich.\n He immediately marched into the East and I still have the pictures in front of my eyes.\n There was a dumb crowd of people sitting at the table.\n And he predicted, they were beaten to part, but they were also exactly with\n the sentiments that Annette describes, Nazis in the East, by the way, the good\n Frey, Norbert Frey, wrote a brilliant book again, where he even wonderfully describes how\n the comrades and comrades-in-arms in the 90s wrote entries to Honecker, there was the practice,\n nobody in the SED looked at what was happening on the streets and what was happening to the right-wing people.\n So there was this scene, she sat down, 89, 90 in the basement and Bella Hanshans speaks to them and says to them, you are called the new generation and the new class of rulers.",
      "But it is partly a long-standing issue, also in science.\n It is about the wave of modern terrorism.\n Terrorism based on ideology,\n which imposes certain doctrines, using certain technologies.\n There are also a few things in between, like how they learn from each other.\n Like I said before, right-wing terrorists from jihadists or also right-wing terrorists from the left.\n It's interesting that the right also take over anti-discrimination discourses from the left\n and use it as your own tongue. So it's really interesting how these elements,\n how these Twitter forms are created.\n The identitians also learn from Gramsci, the left-wing radical.\n But tell us about the first wave.\n When did it start? Why did it start?\n And how did it express itself? It started around 1880. It was the anarchists.\n They had developed in Russia and the most important element in this wave was...\n Not the most important, but one of the elements was this tactic of propaganda of the deed.\n So they just wanted to...\n Through spectacular performances, they wanted to call themselves into the consciousness of the population.\n Back then there was no internet or television.\n Yes, that's a good question propaganda of the act, maybe that's why there weren't other forms of revolt.\n But that was more or less dead. And then it went on with the anti-colonial, the next wave, which then... It's interesting to compare the waves,\n also the question of the success of terrorism.\n Now with the anarchists, when I think about it,\n with the anti-colonials again a relatively successful wave,\n which then partly liberated their countries, so to speak.\n And then it's interesting that, for example,\n if you look into which history,\n also because you talk about history, in which form of history, heritage, in which form of heritage the groups also locate,\n you also have the Christchurch Attentats with the Temple Knights, they also organize themselves in these anti-colonial fights.\n And they also connect to the success of this wave and say, we are also an anti-colonial force.\n Okay, then the third wave came after the Second World War or ...\n colonialism ended in the 60s and 70s, right?\n Yes, that was after the second world war.\n Then came the left-wing terrorism, RAF and so on?\n Exactly, that's practically the third wave to Rappoport.\n Although you have to say that it may be classified differently, but that is definitely helpful to make a pattern. But the new left wave, red army faction, red brigades, action direct.\n And it was also interesting that they transfer of ideas between groups,\n that this exchange took place very strongly.\n And that is also something we deal with in our group, for example, the question of learning.\n My research group is called How Terrorists Learn and it is about learning processes.\n And then there is also the question of how groups of equal-minded people learn, but also of enemies, for example.\n Or what distinguishes learning from the enemy versus learning from a friend?\n And what learning processes are there, I also find in groups, in groups.\n It was interesting, for example, when I was in Northern Ireland, it was 2017, about two years ago.\n They talked about how they, among other things, compared themselves to the Red Army.\n How aware they are of what is happening in the world, but they also compare themselves directly.\n The ANC learned a lot from The ANC, for example, has learned a lot from the ANC.\n The ANC has also motivated them to say, now to take the political path,\n has also gone to prison and so on.\n But they themselves have also distanced themselves from other groups,\n like the Red Army, because they said they couldn't mobilize a mass movement.\n That was a few, so six against six million or ...\n What did they actually want? What was the legitimate claim?\n They also distanced themselves from such failures and said, we are more on the side of the winners.\n It's curious, when you're on the road in the Middle East, the example of the North-Irish conflict is often called,\n how you can communicate between Israelis and Palestinians at some point and come to a solution. The conflict in Northern Ireland and the solution there is of course a role model worldwide.\n And the leaders of the Sinn F\u00e9in have also become global role models.\n It is really interesting that they have received a lot of attention and then said,\n they also pushed it, they and said that they pushed it."

What does it look?\n What does economic policy do in Europe?\n I have now read, we have once again saved the ass of a country.\n We want, we want.\n IWF, I read today, has saved Ukraine.\n How is that?\n Well, IWF plans to support Ukraine with a help loan.\n That means Ukraine gets money from the international cash register,\n which countries like Germany and all other countries in the world have also paid for.\n This money is lent to Ukraine as a loan,\n in the hope that Ukraine can continue to finance the business,\n can keep the state alive and then at some point,\n that is also part of the plan,\n if the country is healthy, this money with interest, as it always is, is repaid to the IMF.\n So we earn with money, like Greece?\n Yes, not directly, because it's not about our national banks, but the IMF.\n It's just IMF, not Troika?\n There are no Troika yet.\n Not yet?\n Not yet. It is also planned that other countries can contribute to this. The IMF gives 15-18 billion dollars, not euros.\n And then a few billion will be added.\n The USA, Japan.\n So that there should be 27 in total.\n Why does Ukraine need the money?\n Do they have such high debts? 200%?\n No, not at all.\n The debts are not the problem.\n The debts are actually relatively low, around 40%.\n Lower than in Germany.\n So half as much as Germany, roughly. Only the problem is that, like almost every country, what the state takes in is not enough to finance everything that is to be financed.\n Now also a little war, possibly.\n And the capital markets, the banks, do not lend the country any more money, because you don't know how it will go on.\n And that's why someone has to jump in and fill this gap.\n And in that case it is the EWF.\n But that has nothing to do with the fact that they want to go to Europe, EU,\n and maybe want to have the Euro. They have to have at least 60% of the state debt.\n Yes, the Euro. I don't even know if they want to have it.\n It would be totally crazy if they got the Euro. So, again, a problem case.\n It has something to do with it indirectly, because Ukraine is already the third program now.\n They have already asked for loans twice.\n Both times the program was cancelled because the deposits were not held.\n Actually, you didn't want to make any more money available, but now the West is so strongly engaged.\n When you say we support you, there is a momentum to say, well, then we have to let that cost us something.\n What conditions are being set there? You say 16, 18 million dollars are given there.\n Two years.\n What for? Is there a saying, we help you or we help you with conditions?\n Yes, as always with the IWF, there are conditions that are laid out,\n they are also fixed in the memorandum of understanding,\n so a loan contract, a loan agreement. And it includes structural reforms, labor market, legislation, corruption fight, transparency,\n it includes short-term cuts, it includes above all...\n Austerity or what?\n Yes, exactly.

Sch\u00e4uble said that Greece...\n Our finance minister.\n Our finance minister.

You can't save the country.\n But Ukraine has a state deficit of about 10%.\n So the gap between a country and a state deficit...\n Somehow you have to make sure that you can't just live on pump for a long time.\n But you get there and then you're right, of course.\n You can try to shorten everything, then the economy goes worse,\n then you take in less and the hole gets bigger and bigger.\n That's why it comes down to the right balance.\n But that a country can't go on like it has been before,\n when it's just 10% in the weeds, I think that's also clear. That, if it just puts 10% in the mire.\n I think that's also clear.\n That's why it comes down to how clever the program is.\n And you can hope that you learn from it.\n The hot topic there are the gas prices.\n And we can talk about that right away.\n That's where it will show, above all.\n Explain to us, how has Ukraine, in the last decades,\n since it has been independent,\n how have they supplied themselves with energy?\n They provided themselves with cheap gas from Russia.\n And the gas itself was not only cheap,\n it was also subsidized by the state.\n That means that there were subsidies for households.\n They didn't have to pay the full gas price, which was already low, but in addition the state took part of the costs, so that energy was really extremely cheap.\n I also learned in Ukraine that the state took over everything.\n At the time, but also completely taken over."

The other thing he said that was very strong was the accusation of not arriving in today's Germany.\n What we concluded was interesting.\n This is also what is accused of migrants over generations.\n So obviously one believes that today's Germany is a closed unit\n and the East Germans have to work their way into it.\n And the other accusation was not to distance oneself enough from extremism.\n In the interviews it was repeatedly said that the brown east overlaps everything,\n that you always have to give yourself a kind of distance before you start talking.\n And we had previously researched this with Muslims,\n who also said that it annoys them\n that every word I start, every debate I start,\n has to start with a distance.\n I also don't like Al-Qaeda or something else.\n I'm a Muslim, but I also don't like Al-Qaeda.\n And that came from the East German side too,\n that they had the East German side too,\n that they had the feeling that they had to introduce any discussion.\n I come from the East, but I am also against racism.\n And from that, such aha moments first came to mind,\n where we thought, interesting, we should test that,\n whether that really is the case or is that just a perception.\n That is very, very central and very important for what happens in post-migrant society.\n First of all, to recognize that the things these people feel are not just pure feeling.\n For this we need these empirical numbers.\n Because as long as it is a pure feeling that the children of the second generation say, we were sent to primary schools on a flat basis if we had a Turkish or Arabic name,\n then it is always just a private anecdote.\n And always someone says, okay, a teacher helped me, a neighbor helped me.\n But when we find out, yes, that's so flat,\n then that first raises it out of the sensitive space. So we tested it and found out, look at it, look at it,\n in fact, about 40 percent of West Germans in all three stereotypes\n accuse the East Germans of it, namely to present themselves as victims,\n not having enough themselves from extremism\n and not having arrived in today's Germany.\n And surprisingly, we found that they are presenting this to Muslims in a similar degree.\n So we tried to make this bridge or this analogy, the comparison.\n I find it interesting that both groups are actually evaluated by the West Germans.\n Are the West Germans the problem then? Well, it's like I just said, there are\n hegemonic groups and there are marginalized groups. Hegemonic means that you are above all\n central structures in politics and society, that you can strongly influence the education canon,\n that you have, so to speak, the power of speakers, that you can speak and hegemony actually means\n that this group is seen as the normal group. We also did surveys in it. Would you\n rather call yourself German or West German? Would you rather call yourself German or West German?\n Would you rather call yourself German or East German?",
      "And what would be very important to me now is that there are also\n stereotypes from East Germans to West Germans.\n If you ask how the West Germans are seen, namely the better\n Wessis, who are capitalistic,\n always swimming on the wog and are completely idle, egocentric and what\n do I know everything is. And exactly this stereotype is also used by the AfD against the\n so-called West German colonizers, who are actually all just a stupid mass.\n And you could also do an initiative like We are the West and see what different people are there.\n So I think it's always about the East.\n You should also take a look at the West and differentiate a little bit.\n And I know, for example, a group of women in Jena, where the men went to the East from the West to build something there.\n They then founded the group of West German women, because they were so labeled and could hardly live in Jena.\n And then they started reading East German literature to to understand the East Germans. So there are extreme stereotypes on both sides.\n I would like to point out at this point that it is perhaps also a question of emphasis.\n It is also a difference whether you say, We are the East. Like the AfD.\n Or if there is an initiative\n that says, no, we are the East.\n So this, we are the East,\n I understood you, is actually\n we don't let you\n take it away from us.\n That is a positive defense mechanism or a defense statement, a self-assertion.\n That's how I perceived it.\n And when I look around like this, I don't find anything that would scare me at all,\n where I would say, are old splits being reopened here?\n This is basically almost the same as what Albrecht said in relation to black-red-gold.\n You must not forget that the black-red-gold flag was the first symbol in Germany\n to overcome the small-state system.\n That was a democratic symbol.\n And this democratic symbol, with which the small-towns of the princes and kings\n were overcome in the direction of a democratic community,\n you can't take that away from narrow-minded nationalists.\n And with the flag you're right, Albrecht.\n And I think with the... No, we're from the East.\n You're actually doing exactly the same.\n And that's why, if you were to criticize something,\n then it would be a criticism of yourself.\n And I think that would be...\n Let me just say something about that, Hans, very briefly.\n Actually...\n I just want to take that up. You just said something interesting.\n You just said something very interesting.\n You can't... I admit it. I'm a very serious guy.\n I want to understand my irony.\n All good.\n But you can't deny that in every...\n and not even in regionalization,\n but in a partialization,\n halving of the country,\n because the conflict goes through all the political debates,\n we know the standing debates about the question of who is willing to claim the color black, red, gold,\n who is not willing to start something with the color in the movement.\n There is of course more to it and that's why I was so sharp in this cementing of a split.\n And I find that a bit problematic.\n That's all, that's why I was maybe unfit for irony in the case, but I think,\n and that's the second thing I have to say, what I find ironic too, the\n registrations are happening, partly of course from the defense perspective,\n which I can understand. But they have been coming from the east for a long time.\n I don't think that the West would emphasize the classical regionalism much more.\n And that's why I was so unironical.\n They would say we are Bavarians, we are W\u00fcrttembergers, we are something else.\n It is fatally a move into the fortification.\n And I don't think that's just as ironic.\n The mirror made the fortation with the title picture.\n That's how the Ossi is.\n We're not talking about the mirror, we're talking about the fact how you react to it.\n That's just the point.\n I'm not talking to mirror editors.\n But it's my discomfort in a way that I thought,\n if you record it, you can at least articulate it. With all acceptance. I think that's right.\n But still, I have a problem.\n I'll put it simply.\n I have a certain problem with taking over even ironic identity politics,\n which wants to counter another identity policy."

These communities tend to be homogenous, where residents may feel a sense of security in knowing their neighbors and being familiar with their surroundings. This sense of safety is threatened when they perceive the presence of outsiders, such as foreigners, including Turks. Additionally, the fear of losing their current lifestyle and the quality of life they enjoy in Vienna, which might be perceived as better than other cities, plays a role in driving support for the FP\u00d6.",

      "Because there is a relatively small sub-section that is really completely unrighteous.\n And it's also different. In Berlin or Hamburg there are no city-states where someone,\n well, not in Hamburg, but there are no no-go areas or no really deglacated ones,\n where any gangs are present.\n It's a relatively socially intact city.\n The unemployment rate in Vienna is relatively normal.\n There was a study, I've seen it a little longer ago,\n that shows that Vienna is one of the safest cities in the world.\n We are in rankings an extremely livable city.\n We can go anywhere, almost everywhere, almost every time.\n And people are afraid to lose that.\n And that also explains that the FP\u00d6 is strong in areas where there are no foreigners at all.\n And it is very weak where there are many foreigners, even if they are not elected.\n It's not like there are foreigners there.\n Like in Saxony, there are the strongest parties, although there are the least refugees and so on.\n There are two explanations. One explanation, or I think there are two truths, and they can't coexist.\n On the one hand, people don't experience the people's relationship with others.\n That means they never see the Turks. And that will be harmless at some point.\n If I see, okay, the Turk is actually like me and he sells vegetables and you can greet him and he's a nice guy.\n First explanation, they never see that, they are afraid,\n because they look at their backs and are afraid that the Turks will come.\n And the second is that people are afraid that they will lose something,\n because they live in a homogeneous society and they want to defend it.\n The principle of change.\n Why does the left in Austria, SP\u00d6 has not found an answer to this?\n What could be the answer?\n There is fear of losses in Germany, fear of losing something.\n First of all, the SP\u00d6 is still not a party of emotionalization. The whole SP\u00d6 of Vienna has not played the racist card.\n It could have been done easily, just like other SP\u00d6 politicians would like to do it, but it never worked.\n Can you only express emotions in Austria with racism?\n That's the easiest form.\n And it has no answer to the identity crisis.\n It has no answer to the refugee question. And if it has an answer, it is too weak to communicate.\n You could stand here and say, wait a minute, in this city they have such a high quality of life for this and that and that and that reason. I would, if I were a civil servant here, I would poster at every corner and explain to people what they are\n offered here in terms of quality of life that is no longer available in other cities in the world.\n People should go to Rome or to the city of Hamburg. Let's see,\n how does it look elsewhere? But that is not communicated because it is somehow\n self-evident. The second is is that the SP\u00d6 failed to convey this Europeanization and internationalization of Austria to people as something positive.\n 23 years ago, Austria joined the EU.\n And Austria was, if we take the case of the Iron Front, away from it, let's say in the years 1989, so 30 years ago, Austria was cut off from the case of the Iron Front in the past, let's say in the years 1989,\n so 30 years ago, Austria was cut off from the East and the West.\n It was a provincial country, a country of ruins with a lot of people with stele hats and\n loom coats and grand vines.\n And this country has changed in a way that is breathtaking in the last 30 years.\n It has not only become more international, it has also become more open. There is a strong civil society.\n There is a strong cultural scene here. Vienna is the most growing city or one of the most growing cities in Germany.\n It is the second largest German-speaking city. It is a bustling town. But that\n the ruling SP\u00d6 in this city did't tell people that this was a chance.\n And the right-wingers always say, oh, everything will be taken away, everything will fall.\n Although that's not the case objectively.\n Why is there no party on the left of the SP\u00d6?\n Because the Greens, unlike the social democratic movements, didn't want to improve the situation of the people, but rather the people.\n And that had something to do with God and it gets on people's nerves.",
      "German housing associations.\n That was essentially a matter of property relations.\n That went out clearly.\n But then it remains unfulfilled in terms of implementation.\n Because politics doesn't want that.\n Although it was democratically decided in a way that has consequences.\n Well, it's not a strong mandate for the politics.\n The politics can still do something else, even with this referendum.\n Sure.\n But the politics...\n I don't want to express myself to this case, because I know it intimately.\n I have observed it as a citizen, but I didn't look at it that closely.\n The politics has been on the side of those who are supposed to be disowned, namely the private real estate owners.\n But with the argument that it would be an extremely expensive purchase, that it would bind all forces over many years.\n There are a few other arguments that have been brought to the table.\n That was their claim. There was a commission that had to cancel many things.\n But of course, there is an extremely strong power of defense of those who are on the sunny side.\n That's the way it is.\n And that's why there is this extremely strong reproduction of inequality,\n especially on the housing market, where you can always say for good reasons,\n housing is also a social good like other social goods, I mean someone\n who has no roof over his head or no possibility to somehow have sanitary facilities is\n someone who is extremely excluded from society and housing is partly the new social\n question, especially in the metropolitan area and we also have a lot of migration, where the living conditions in the ballroom areas are also intensifying.\n That's why I see the need to get into a kind of political mode,\n which doesn't just always say everything has to stay the way it is\n and secure the property,\n but where you also have to think about what are actually interesting models.\n There are always the people who refer to Vienna with a large share of communal living space,\n where obviously these problems, at least with this massification, do not occur that much.\n It is certainly not easy to find a flat in Vienna, but you don't have this enormous change to the living space as an investment object with all the following price increases and also profit maximization orientation of those who have invested.\n You show in your book with trigger points, so split as our society is supposed to be, it's not. So if you look at the attitudes to certain topics,\n you have somehow found out that 75% of Germans are very concerned about climate change,\n 79% think the balance of wealth is too large,\n 84% think trans people should be recognized as normal.\n So that's a huge majority.\n So they are obviously all in agreement.\n I'm reading out there now, okay, the last decades that we are already quite progressive, culturally progressive.\n We recognize new things.\n But the basic problem we just discussed, based on a lot of frustration, where the right-wing is coming from, is an economic one.\n And we are not economically progressive at all, but rather reactionary or conservative.\n So the economic should stay the way it is.\n Yes, there is this difference that we often make between the old industrial, industrial-social or economic conflict between capital and work\n or between top and bottom and then new conflict fields or conflict arenas, as we call them,\n which then deal with issues of diversity and discrimination, climate change, climate protection and migration,\n which each have their own conflict logics.\n And political attention has already been moved towards these new arenas.\n That means the old one, as I said, exists and the shoe still pushes,\n but it has in a way depoliticized and stepped into the background.\n And now we are of course...\n As a rich man I think that's good.\n Now we are of course only arguing about migration or the building energy law and so on.\n So it is of course also a kind of agenda setting that prevails there.\n And of course there are also new political actors who have taken part in the plan. Whether it is climate-political movements and activists or whether it is right-wing populist parties and organizations,\n which of course now also restructure the conflict area a bit.\n And of course this economic issue is no longer so central.\n The entire political system, the whole left-right scheme scheme, was organized along the economic distribution question.\n And now there is a cultural axis of openness, liberalization, cultural equality, and on the other hand,\n nationalist, chauvinist, traditionalist, whatever you want, which now has a stronger social salience."

You were in the GDR.\n Maybe you even became a socialist. Why didn't you choose the left or the PDS at the time?\n Well, less for the socialists. I can tell you an anecdote.\n When I came to the GDR, I didn't have my own flight ticket.\n The GDR gave me the scholarship, but without a flight ticket.\n I didn't know how I got here. I didn't have parents who could give me that, but an uncle who gave me the flight ticket with the condition that I shouldn't become a communist.\n He thought that if people study socialism, they do 90% communism and then Marxism-Leninism, they do 10% subject.\n And then I would never have become a communist.\n The SPD was the question why, because the topic of education was important to me.\n I knew that the SPD was at the center of this.\n To say that every child must have the opportunity to be successful in education, regardless of the money that their parents are stealing.\n And I found that in SPD as an important topic.\n And because of my biography, which really clearly shows that I have only progressed in the field of education,\n in the field of schools, in the field of universities, because I was given the financial opportunity,\n i.e. the support of financial support of the state.\n I am convinced that many young people can be successful in the field of education.\n If we put the focus on education structures,\n education infrastructure, but also on staff,\n more teachers, more day-care schools, more social work,\n then many children can also be successful.\n That's why I joined SPD and am committed to education.\n Green and left were no option?\n No, that was not an option. SPD came to that, maybe people don't know that.\n I think parties are almost like family when you take work seriously,\n that you are always in exchange with people.\n At SPD I knew many people with whom I could exchange ideas.\n They knew me as a party member in many structures.\n We met, celebrated birthdays, grilled together, ate together, go to the pub together. These friendships were formed.\n And without me being a member of the SPD, I had a lot of people...\n I didn't even know that they were members of the SPD.\n I'm with them...\n I'm always dealing with those people\n where it was serious that I wanted to make a decision to join a party.\n I looked at them and said, well...\n First, the content. Of first, education was the decisive factor,\n and then the second, the environment.\n My environment was shaped as a social democratic one, without really knowing that these people are members of the SPD.\n And that worked.\n And a third aspect is not insignificant.\n I grew up with my brother-in-law and my sister grew up in Senegal. My brother-in-law was a businessman,\n so you can call it middle class, and he always had visions. He told us, me and his children,\n always said, so you have to know, nothing comes alone, you have to do something yourself, you have to\n make sure that the relationship changes,\n both materially and in society.\n Nothing comes alone.\n When I came to Germany, I was interested in politics,\n I read political biographies and so on.\n And then I found this sentence from my brother-in-law,\n from Willy Brandt.\n Willy Brandt always said that nothing comes alone and rarely in the long run.\n I said wow.\n On a birthday of Willy Brandt, he was honored with a film.\n I said, after I saw the whole biography as a summary in the form of a film, I said in a way, a summary, in a way, a film, the party of this man is your party.\n What he says, what he thinks,\n that's how your brother-in-law, who is actually an illiterate in a small town in Senegal, thinks the same way.\n He says, you have to do something yourself, nothing comes alone.\n His party, the party of Willy Brandt, that's your party."

No. Why?\n That has to do with economic reasons, that there was never a big economic crisis afterwards.\n And the majority of people feel that their personal freedom is constantly increasing.\n And that's why there was no pressure in the bowl. At the end of last year, only a few days, when the protesters held up these white cards.\n But that was only a very small movement, if not in several cities.\n But otherwise, people are busy earning money, making sure that their children have a better education, to travel, to develop their personal freedoms.\n Was that also a movement for more co-determination.\n But it wasn't a constitutional movement for democracy in the narrow sense.\n You didn't wish to have our leader elected?\n That didn't play a central role. It was more about the question of more determination. It remained more vague.\n Basically, you wanted to determine more where it would go.\n Can young Chinese people learn something about the student movement from back then, if they wanted to?\n So could they read something about it in Chinese media or in the internet?\n Not in the censored media, but they could of course download a VPN channel, like many hundred million people do.\n And then they have access to all international media, also in Chinese language.\n That works.\n Do you also do research?\n Yes, sure.\n Is that difficult?\n No. Why?\n It's just a program, you press on and everything is fine.\n I think the least VPR users use it all the time, but we don't need it, do we?\n Exactly.\n Okay. You were 27, you stayed with your family?\n No, back then...\n You mean you went with your girlfriend?\n Yes, but that wasn't family yet. That was my girlfriend and family came much later. So children.\n Now you're almost 30 years old.\n Yes, exactly.\n Do you speak all Chinese fluently? No. My children laugh at me.\n I just got stuck at some point, so to speak.\n If you don't sit down every night and learn for three hours, you won't get any further at some point.\n And I prefer to drink a glass of wine in the evening.\n Do you speak Mandarin?\n Yes, most people speak Mandarin. There are basically only two major languages.\n That is Cantonese, which is spoken in the south, but the main language is Mandarin."

Both CDU and SPD agreed on that.\n We don't stick to it, we talk about it all the time.\n We do a lot about this issue.\n We have clearly explained that the question of blue plaques and the actual rearmament of the diesel is a question of the coalition.\n We are not silent about it.\n I think the blue package should be made more known.\n I don't think that's generally known.\n That is not yet known in general.\n But that is the appropriate instrument with which you then have to ensure that there are no\n surface-to-ground traffic bans.\n It's a joke actually.\n The Greens want to prevent surface-covering driving bans.\n They will come if you don't do anything.\n And they want to prevent that by marking clean cars and by making the\n Schummel diesel into clean vehicles. Relatively clean vehicles.\n I would like to have cleaner ones, but at least vehicles that meet the\n legal requirements.\n The protection is made by the diesel driver.\n You just mentioned the Klatten as oligarchs. Are there oligarchs you call clans or structures that are not only rich,\n but that connect this wealth with political power and political influence.\n This is the image you have of Russian oligarchs, for example.\n And that is not different in this case.\n We have used in Germany such a seductive way of speaking in Germany.\n We talk about family businesses and everyone thinks of dad, mom, son and child\n and they have such a small middle-class clich\u00e9. According to the definition of the\n family entrepreneur himself, Volkswagen was, by the way, when Ferdinand Piech was the\n chairman there, a family business when Ferdinand Piech was chairman there.\n Because it was a majority family and a member of the family was in charge of the operational business.\n That's the definition, so to speak.\n It has nothing to do with big and small.\n I think you shouldn't let this delusion pass.\n Yes, there are real small medium-sized companies, families are involved,\n and that's the majority of these companies, but you have to differentiate them from oligarchic structures,\n which are capable of taking political influence beyond elections and majorities.\n And that is certainly true for such a large\n oligarchic association as the Porsche-Pich family.\n That is certainly true for the Quanz.\n In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg we are still falling into a few others.\n Are there also from other areas,\n except the automotive sector?\n Of course, if you look at it,\n the big energy suppliers have played a similar role for a long time,\n until they got so angry at the energy transition that they became a case of renovation.\n But they lived in the self-confidence to do what they were doing for a long time.\n What they were doing, the politicians would already understand.\n But it was always different there.\n There were no large family\n companies or large oligarchic groups, but they were largely semi-governmental\n or, as we are today, still completely state-owned. But they always had an influence on politics as a company\n that went far beyond what a company that Windturbinen in Aurich has.\n Is Friedrich Springer an oligarch?\n I think that the Springer-Publish and its chairman D\u00f6pfner and the co-most important shareholder,\n Mrs. Springer, play a central role, especially in election discussions.\n You can see that on these days, with what enthusiasm,\n for example, the FDP and Christian Lindner were pampered until recently,\n with what impression they tried to make in Rhineland-Pfalz,\n Julia Kl\u00f6ckner as the prime minister, which the lady herself stuttered.\n So they have political influence.\n Nevertheless, I would not raise the industrial weight\n as high as they do, for example, for Porsche and Piech or Klatten\n or the owners of Conti and similar things.\n Can you put yourself in the bed with the Bild?\n No, why should I do that?\n To achieve political goals, to start a campaign.\n I treat the Bild newspaper like all other media.\n However, I also made experience with the Bild newspaper,\n which I did not make with other newspapers.",
      "Can you list how much that also cost the state?\n I have to pay now, but that was in the billions.\n 12 billion euros. How billions. 12 billion euros.\n In Europe, I think.\n No, no, BMI.\n Germany.\n It was created by the fact that the financial authorities and the financial authorities relied on the manufacturer's recommendations.\n And then of course the power plant tax was lower.\n It depends on the PS and also on the performance and and the emissions. And not on the actual emissions.\n That must have been known, it was known.\n Or the fact that the license plate, there is also such a three-stage license plate of cars.\n With a consumer, Fritz Vorholz has once proven from time to time that he has the same efficiency as a Panzer Leopard and a Fiat 500.\n Because of course they got efficiency discounts with the weight.\n That's all incomprehensible.\n I just asked who is the politically most powerful person who is not a politician.\n You didn't answer that, but who is the most politically powerful corporation in Germany?\n Is it VW?\n I find it hard to name one, but I think the car corporations are one of the corporations that is particularly closely linked to politics.\n It's already starting to happen that the Netherlands is involved in the VW corporation.\n There is a clear distinction between state and car group.\n But I also think that,\n until recently, the Deutsche Bank was also,\n I don't know if it still plays such a role.\n I think it's the corporations,\n the question is difficult for me to answer,\n I think it's the interaction of different branches\n that have different strong corporations.\n If you talk about power today, in the sense of influence,\n we are sure that on a European level,\n the digital corporations,\n which have an incredible influence on their means.\n What I take from your book is that you explain what is actually legal.\n What the corporations do. You brought up the Internet corporation.\n You write that they create monopolies, enable the manipulation of politics,\n create precarious working conditions and park their astronomical profits\n to the damage of society and the tax crisis.\n That's all legal. You write that excessive debt from banks with minimal\n capital is responsible for financial and economic crises.\n Everything is legal. Car companies earn billions with cars that contribute to climate warming and their exhaust gases that harm human health.\n That's legal. Energy companies heat up the climate with fossil fuels. Everything is legal.\n Food companies sell and advertise sugar-containing refreshments as an expression of an active lifestyle\n and thus scientifically Because when we talk about the car companies and VW, we are clearly dealing with legal breaches.\n But the main part of the book is not about illegal business practices, which are only sufficiently\n persecuted by the civil and criminal law, but with the very legal business models of the companies.\n You just filled them out with their seemingly legal effects,\n which on the other hand, in general, are very damaging.\n And my thesis that is in it is that because the power of the corporations has become so strong,\n it is increasingly difficult for politics to illegalize these legal damages.\n So let's take the example of banks.\n The banks have increasingly connected in the last 20 years.\n We had that with Adenauer's show when Abs, the chairman of the German Bank,\n I don't know if you still know that, that was the chairman of the German Bank at the time,\n who regularly sat down with Adenauer. That was the chancellor.\n And of course it was only about what the Deutsche Bank in Germany does and not.\n But if today the Ackermann or someone meets with Mrs. Merkel,\n then he speaks in the name of banks that are strongly networked worldwide.\n And because it is more difficult to regulate,\n then of course these damages are much more difficult to regulate, these damages are more difficult to illegalize.\n There is a completely different drive behind it.\n The regulatory power of the state has remained the same, but the global activity of the companies,\n their financial potential and their global network has increased. So in my view, the balance is increasingly disturbed.\n And that makes things really bad, because the prospects for change are low.\n On the other hand, the viewer asks himself, as I do,\n is it really not possible to make these relatively simple political changes so that humanity is spared of these damages.\n I've been politicized for 15 years now. I'm 32 years old, I have my youth without politics, but I've been involved for 15 years."

    "response": "\nEconomists should not assume people behave rationally when making decisions in specific situations where individuals tend to overlook long-term consequences, have biases, or exhibit irrational preferences. Alternative behavioral economic models may include taking into account cognitive limitations, emotional influences, and social factors to better understand and predict human behavior within various economic scenarios.",
    "contexts": [
      "So you would think that's not the problem with the model.\n The problem with the model is probably rationality.\n Are people all so rational?\n What does reason mean?\n They are limited in that. On the one hand, because they have limited capacity to go through things,\n they don't have as much time as they want, to look at everything carefully.\n What are the best options? What is the best price, to make the decision reasonably.\n Even if you are overwhelmed by the situation,\n I want to look for an insurance,\n what is the best insurance, it is super complicated.\n Moving around on the Internet now, the situation is very complicated,\n it is also difficult for you, the companies do not help you.\n So that means that at this point many people do not behave this point. And that has to be taken into account.\n Nowadays, models are being used to make behavioral economic considerations.\n And the important thing now is to understand exactly in which situations I have to take this into account,\n that people don't necessarily behave so rationally, that they, for example,\n don't think about the future, have preferences, where they say today, tomorrow I'll start,\n I'll stop smoking, but today again the last one and then tomorrow again and so on. All\n these things happen. In which situation is this important? Do I have to consider this? In which situation is it not important?\n By the way, this is an important research area we do in Munich. It is a major topic where we ask ourselves exactly such questions.\n When can I work with the Homo economicus and come to good predictions and where do I not come to good predictions?\n Because people actually behave differently, are not so rational.\n Have you ever met a homo economicus?\n One single one.\n They don't normally behave like that.\n I think many people try to make reasonable decisions,\n but as I said, they are not always able to do so.\n For different reasons.\n But that doesn't necessarily mean that we can't start with the model.\n Yes, but if you say that, it doesn't really exist.\n Yes, again, the point is that we want to use these models to be able to predict something,\n to say that we are now leading a different policy, what will change then?\n And that should be a good prediction as much as possible.\n You can also work with simplified models if the assumption I make is not the decisive one.\n I can also analyze a market and say that it has two companies or it has five companies or it has ten companies.\n If the result is not dependent on whether there are three or four, then it doesn't matter whether I write three or four in there. So the question is,\n is that a clear assumption? If I take that assumption and if everything changes,\n then it is not a good assumption, then I should not make the assumption. But there are\n enough situations where that assumption is one that one can work with quite well and comes to\n reasonably reasonable conclusions,\n then I don't have to complicate life.\n The bad thing is, as soon as I say that people are not so rational,\n I have to have an idea of what form they are not rational in.\n What exactly is different for them?\n And if I think about insurance and see people overestimate small risks.\n The risk that their suitcase will be stolen.\n Close travel insurance.\n Complete nonsense if you calculate it rationally.\n Many people do that because they overestimate it.\n It's a great business model for the insurance companies that offer it.\n It would be a clever idea to take into account that people behave like that.\n Has Monika Schnitzer ever felt the invisible hand of the market?\n The invisible hand of the market.\n That's another metaphor for the economy. Yes, again, the idea is that people behave in their own sense, maximizing profit, maximizing profit,\n they don't care about what everyone else is doing.\n And how by a miracle it comes to a nice market result, where the goods are offered\n that I want to have and the companies make profits because the people buy it and\n no one has taken care of it. This is of course nonsense insofar as this market\n of course only works when I, I mentioned it earlier, when I have designed nice rules.\n For example, when I make sure that there is competition,\n when I make sure that consumers are informed about the prices,\n when contracts are passed and so on.\n It takes a lot of rules to make such a market work.",
      "I suffered and didn't\n come to the idea of doing something else.\n And because it was so fast,\n it was okay.\n What did you suffer from?\n I found it strange, I found statistics interesting and I found Jura interesting. What interests me today is macroeconomy, for example.\n It was taught incredibly sterilely and completely free of practice.\n And I honestly felt that microeconomy was terrible, because there were all these maximizing beings and the difference curves and so on.\n And so when you thought about it once, then you could do it well.\n And then afterwards you always felt uncomfortable if you didn't have any optimization problems anymore.\n But to be honest, everyone should be clear that the people are not like that. And I found it actually incredible that this idea, that these functions of use should now be maximized.\n And I found that completely sterile and strange.\n And was it taught to you that there is this homo economicus?\n So Hans-Werner Sinn likes to talk about it.\n Yes, that means that it exists. no one? These are theoretical assumptions. Well, and if you now, I had the problem, I was interested in philosophy and I also did a lot of scientific theory voluntarily.\n And then you come quite quickly to the question, how is that actually, should that be hypotheses?\n And you actually check the hypotheses.\n And if they don't confirm themselves, then they are falsified or at least you have a problem.\n At that time there was already experimental research. Behavioral economics began quite daily.\n That was still called decision-theoretical anomalies. So to speak, that you noticed something was wrong.\n But that obviously didn't bother anyone.\n So to speak, the essential doubts existed since the 50s.\n With the Allay Paradox and so on.\n That the fundamental axioms of this theory of use\n could not actually be proven,\n but instead constantly falsified.\n But still, they were held to it.\n I found that strange.\n There are still some today.\n Yes, it is like that.\n You are trained in it.\n And it has also increased again.\n Because the formalization has increased again,\n people are now in the master programs\n are trimmed again.\n That they then\n really learn it axiomatically and then really with the hard math and so on.\n But ultimately you don't really need to do that anymore.\n That is very much more empirical today and very much less, if you will, theoretically dogmatic oriented.\n But why is that taught?\n If that's a matter of belief.\n I find the dogma historically interesting.\n And in many areas,\n for example in the business sector,\n I think that the idea of \u200b\u200bmaximizing profit\n is probably not so bad.\n So to speak, as a first approach.\n You can explain a lot of things with it.\n But even there you can get into trouble quickly.\n But in the consumer area I actually see little use there.\n I still had my diploma work on optimal taxation,\n and how to check it empirically was very sobering.\n I also dug into it and then I noticed the contradictions to the theory of science.\n Which ones? I noticed this a lot in the field of science theory. Not in any other way? Well, the contradiction is that you are constantly forced to use a theory\n whose empirical foundations are completely doubtful.\n Explain the theory again.\n The theory is that people are very rational, self-sufficient, they have a function and in this function they can\n evaluate all kinds of goods bundles and bring them into a consistent order of rank.\n And every person can do that and basically has it all in his head all the time\n and then constantly makes such optimising decisions.\n And that's not realistic.\n Have you ever asked your professor if that makes sense?\n I was lucky, I had an incredibly well-known\n and theoretically well-trained professor in the basic studies in Mikro,\n Karl Christian von Weizs\u00e4cker, who gave a great lecture.\n However, I think we were 600 or 800 people in the lecture hall.\n And since I didn't have the tendency to go forward, I always sat quite far back.\n And the idea that you would go to the teacher and ask him something was\n relatively vague i was also very shy and very so i couldn't imagine that was\n somehow like godlike creatures that you don't somehow look for contact with\n but i think that if you had gone if i had gone and asked\n then that would probably not have been a problem.\n But it was all very hierarchical and unapproachable, you could say."

Regarding externalities and the environment, he states that the problem arises when individuals do not pay for the consequences of their actions. Proper regulations, taxes, and bans should be implemented to address issues such as resource depletion and environmental destruction.",
    "contexts": [
      "That's capital.\n Why does the capitalist do that?\n Why do you do that? The capitalist does that to make profits, the economist would say,\n to produce things and later to be able to sell them. And you do it mainly because the productivity\n increases, because we don't have to work so hard. The best example is the mechanization of agriculture. For centuries, people worked mostly in agriculture.\n You had to stand in the field all day long and work hard to mow the corn and to feed yourself. work. And today you take a tractor, that's capital. A farmer who has a tractor,\n that's a capitalist in the sense that someone is the one who uses capital and\n today he is doing what hundreds of people used to have to do with hard work. And that is the\n great strength of capital use, not of capitalism, but of capital use, that one creates prosperity.\n Do you see yourself as a representative of market economy or capitalism?\n I see myself as a student of market economy and capitalism. I am interested in how the whole thing works. In addition, I am convinced that if we ask ourselves what creates prosperity and freedom,\n then I say that it is generated by market economy and capitalism.\n However, capitalism and market economy not in any form, but under certain conditions, as I mentioned earlier.\n For example, that competition prevails. In a monopoly, in monopoly capitalism,\n you still live better than in no capitalism. But it's better. So capitalism,\n market economy must go together, especially with competition. That is important.\n Is capitalism the ultimate plus ultra for a society?\n Yes, capitalism has many weaknesses, just like democracy, but it is the best form of economy we know.\n And the one that generates the greatest prosperity for the largest number of people.\n And in this respect it is the non plus ultra.\n Did you have anything to do with ecology in your studies?\n Well, with ecology...\n That you are explained how our economies destroy the planet.\n The economists would say with externalities.\n That's the topic of ecology and environmental destruction.\n This is a central topic in the study.\n If you can use resources without paying for something,\n if you can raise other costs and you do not include them in your calculation yourself, then there is a problem.\n And that is a central issue.\n In the welfare economy, I just described it, you start with this main sentence,\n yes, market economy will lead to the best results, provided there are no externalities.\n Yes, what if there are externalities now?\n Yes, then you need regulation, then there are different possibilities, regulation, taxes, bans, bans.\n You have to organize the whole thing in such a way that this overuse of this robbery doesn't work.\n And there are then various classic examples that are already being discussed in the study.\n It starts with the tragedy of the Almende, that comes from the Middle Ages. There was the idea that the forest and field belong to everyone.\n And that led to a destruction of the world. Because if something belongs to everyone, then it comes to overuse.\n So the individual uses these alments, drives his cattle on it until it's possible, before the neighbor drives his cattle on the meadow and best of all cuts off the forest immediately away because the neighbor will cut it off tomorrow.\n And that leads to natural destruction and then the market economy comes in again.\n If you privatize the forest and if you privatize the meadow, then the problem is solved.\n That doesn't solve every problem, but the problem is solved.\n I ask this because today there was a report in the Tagesschau that our Ministry of the Environment wants to create a plan for the circular economy. What do you think about that?\n Yes, as always, it depends on how you do it. So circular economy is good insofar as we have the garbage problem, we have the problem of plastic pollution of the sea. And I think that's a classic example of this tragedy of the\n almanac now only transferred to the oceans. So we destroy our life's foundations when\n everyone throws their plastic bottles into the river. And this microplastic is what you find\n in all kinds of fish today. It is a huge environmental problem and circular economy is the goal to prevent it.\n To be able to collect these substances, recycle them.\n We know it from paper.\n I think it's particularly serious in this example. that there is actually pollution of the sea and it penetrates all living things and makes us sick.",
      "Would you be at least on board that we say, okay, we'll screw that back a little bit,\n that we don't strive for as much as possible, so profit maximization, but profit.\n Because then you can, for example, combine climate protection and everything else.\n Then you don't need to exploit people anymore, because you want to maximize profit.\n Then you don't need to destroy the environment anymore.\n But it might be better not to do it\n and then make less profit.\n I would of course agree to that.\n But for me it has nothing to do with capitalism.\n So what you describe,\n where people exploit the environment\n and cause damage and want to make as much profit as possible,\n and maybe they can, that has nothing to do with capitalism, but with a abuse of market economy.\n Because market economy means that all people interact with each other at eye level.\n And in such a market economy such capitalism does not exist\n there are simply natural limits to this because every person has skills and talents and if\n they are debauched and honored then there is no high inequality there is\n inequality yes but my criticism of the inequality that we have in Germany\n in terms of wealth and income is that this inequality is caused by a misuse, not necessarily\n by those who have now achieved this, but by a malfunction of our market economy has come about either because a market was abused\n because some have benefited from the interests of others or because many people did not have the chance\n to be in this market so i think we are not apart from that for me it is only the terminology\n i think in the market economy capitalism for the basis for prosperity. What I'm also moning today in the book is the abuse of the market economy.\n Is it the same for you, market economy and capitalism? Is it synonymous?\n Yes.\n Yes.\n A market economy, a market means there are different actors, it can also be state employees, private actors who are in competition with each other,\n who also have property, who have capital, who of course try to be better than the others.\n And yes, market economy and capitalism belong together.\n Of course they have a different connotation, but they belong together.\n Marcel, that's it. Thank you very much for your time.\n Your new book is called The New Reconciliation.\n When did we last talk to you? Three years ago?\n I think three or four years ago.\n Then let's not waste so much time next time.\n I would be happy. I thank you, Thilo.\n You?\n You.\n Thank you.\n Thank you. Thank you.

    "query": "What role do private hospitals play in the German healthcare system and how do they differ from public hospitals in terms of case quotas and cost structures?",
    "response": "\nIn the German healthcare system, private hospitals represent around a third of the market share alongside free-of-charge hospitals and municipal hospitals. Private hospitals typically focus on specialization and profit from it due to the case-reference system used in Germany. This system sets average prices based on defined performances called DRGs (Diagnosis Related Groups). However, single cases may require varying levels of effort, leading to differences in costs. Hospitals with high caseloads or specializations can benefit from reduced fixed costs and lower operating expenses. Public hospitals receive the same case quotas as private ones, but their primary goal is providing basic care rather than focusing on specific diseases.",
    "contexts": [
      "There is only one significant difference.\n Not everyone can open a fire brigade and it is also distributed in a demand-based way across the city and across the country.\n We have too many hospitals in certain regions and too few in other regions.\n Maybe we should distribute this like the police and the fire department, in a demand-based way.\n A demand-based control, I am immediately for it, but it is also a prerequisite for another financing.\n If you say we want to do a food cost financing as a welfare insurance, the costs that fall should be compensated.\n If you think about it as a concept, then in my opinion it is only possible if you have created a need-based structure beforehand.\n I come from the M\u00fcnsterland, I'll put myself in the corner. In M\u00fcnster there are objectively too many hospitals with too many beds.\n And that's not a matter of not being exhausted. The question is only how well the resources are used, including the personnel resources, for example.\n In the Ruhr area, in Berlin, whenever I talk about hospitals and the structure, everyone is worried about the country.\n We don't want to talk about the individual hospital being lonely in the country, which is absolutely necessary.\n We are talking about structures here where money is also\n compulsory. I mean, we both like to pay our contributions to the health insurance,\n but others see it more as compulsory tax by law. And I think that is also a\n obligation to use the money efficiently. And the case reports themselves have the idea that\n the money flows where patients are treated.\n So is that still the right scale for you?\n It is not the perfect financing, but in the given structure, with the hospital structures as they are, it is from my point of view the best way to distribute the money in such a way that it goes where patients are treated.\n What would be the alternative proposal?\n Why don't we change the structure?\n Why don't we take out the profit-forcing?\n I mean, alone 2018.\n We have a third of all clinics in Germany are privatized, are private.\n In 2018 they made a billion euros in profit together.\n Wouldn't these one billion euros be better raised in the system?\n With the logic of doctors making a profit,\n pharmacies making a profit, dentists making a profit. We can talk about that too.\n If you want to make everything state-owned now. So my impression is, by the way, that state-owned\n systems, Great Britain is a state-owned system, France is a much more state-owned system.\n We're talking about our system now. Yes, but we can maybe see in the crisis\n that our system is pretty strong. The state-owned systems did not get through the crisis\n better than ours and the purely private ones, the USA, neither.\n But the system as we have it, from my point of view, in between the care of the population, insurance possibility for everyone, insurance protection for everyone,\n clear legal rules regarding prices, access, structures and distribution,\n very strong in the legal framework and at the same time,\n but also actors who act in their own responsibility,\n also in their own financial responsibility,\n that in the end that brings good results.\n But you recognize that private clinics\n extract money from the health care system,\n which would, for example, be better raised for our nurses.\n The question is what happens to the profit, also in a company.\n You can think what happens to it.\n Not rarely, also in a company, I can't speak for everyone, but also invested in profit.\n The question is what causes the profit.\n Does the profit come from exploitation of nurses? The profit is generated from exploiting the caretakers. That's your assumption, it doesn't work anymore.\n Since the first of January, you can no longer save on the burden of care.\n Because that happened, undisputed, it has happened, we have changed the law.\n Who saves on the caretakers gets less money.\n He gets only as much as he spends on care.\n Otherwise, if he spends more on care, there is more.\n And at the same time you can also optimize processes.\n Of course, the question of what a building looks like.\n It is not uncommon that when a private person takes over a municipal house that has grown over 100 years,\n something has always been added, the operating room is not necessarily ideal in the processes,\n it is not uncommon to be rebuilt and invested and optimized processes.\n If from this optimized processes efficiency gains arise, I think that's completely okay, because that's also beneficial for all employees if the processes are better.",
      "That's for sure right. That's also a problem here in general. I also know people\n who work for large American pharmaceutical companies. They always have big problems explaining to their colleagues in the central\n in New York or elsewhere or Boston how the German health system works.\n That you can't just call Ms. Merkel here and say, now change our\n pharmaceutical price system, that this is a bit more difficult here.\n There are also quite a few German corporations, like Bayer or Merck, who know how to deal with it, but the Americans don't always understand it.\n You just said homeopathy. Why do German health insurance companies pay homeopathic treatments, medicine, etc. The question is completely justified, but it does not belong to the compulsory services.\n These are which are not really a big risk. Actually, it's homeopathy, I say that very clearly,\n that's charlatanism, there are enough evidence for that.\n But now, you have to say that a good doctor always has a certain repertoire of placebos.\n Because placebos sometimes have a felt effect at least. But\n overall, the question is completely justified why the health insurance company has to pay for that.\n What role do the hospitals play, the hospital industry?\n Well, you have to see first, it is divided into three. There There is also about a third of the market share.\n That is the private ones, Helios, Asklepios, Rh\u00f6n, the big hospital corporations.\n Then there are the free-of-use, mostly church, so Diakonie or Caritas.\n They also have about a third of the market share.\n And then the municipal hospitals. They each have very different\n structures, but they all get the same case quotas from the hospitals. The\n private ones usually make profits by specializing. The problem with these case-reference It was developed in the US and imported to Germany.\n We have developed our own DRG system.\n These are all average prices for defined performance.\n The problem with the price finding for such prices in the health care system is that they always depend on average costs.\n But the single case is often different from these average costs.\n There are cases where even with the same diagnosis,\n sometimes less effort is needed, sometimes more.\n You can't determine that from the beginning.\n And that's why hospitals with high cases\n or with specialization have cost advantages,\n because they can then reduce the fixed costs in these areas\n , the operating costs also play a role, so energy and so on,\n and that is why private hospitals have often specialized in certain\n disease patterns and the whole thing is a bit to the disadvantage of basic care.\n That's a problem.\n That's why we basically have, because the whole development in medicine is about\n that more and more ambulances can be made.\n And that you really only do the special things in the hospital.\n And that also requires a completely different organization.\n So these small hospitals are simply no longer viable.\n But there are always huge protests in the population, I can understand that,\n when a hospital is to be closed or a department to be closed.\n Because you have the feeling that we no longer have any care here in our vicinity.\n But that is on the other hand, you can just have 120 births a year can also be done at the expense of quality and safety.\n Because they don't have the experience.\n Or in other areas, for example, hip surgery or something like that,\n small hospitals often don't do that in the required number of cases.\n There are also legal provisions that hospitals should provide for certain areas a required number of cases. There are also legal regulations that hospitals for certain areas in a certain\n number of services per year to provide, because that is clearly proven, the higher\n the number of cases, the better the quality of care. Simply because there is routine,\n because they know a lot about it and that's just the way it is. But that's a question,\n a structural problem of our care system, which I just said, this strict separation from ambulant and stationary.\n That's why we have made it much too much stationary, that it is actually made ambulant.\n That is also one of the wrong claims, that the health system has no rationalization effects.\n But they have enormous rationalization effects, but they have enormous rationalization effects. Only through the development of anesthesia are things no longer necessary in the stationary care\n because you can also make them ambulant. So cataract surgery or\n things like that. So there is enormous potential for rationalization."

Here, the differences in leadership positions disappear. However, it is crucial to remember that the experiences of the East Germans differ significantly from those of the West Germans due to the historical background of the GDR. Thus, the specific challenges faced by the East Germans in terms of political representation and leadership opportunities are unique and require attention.",
    "contexts": [
      "There was also the W study that said, we all know, for example, there are still injustices or inequalities.\n 77% of the leadership in the East are\n still West Germans, for example. But if you look at the\n generations that are younger than 47, you no longer find the\n differences in the possibilities to get to leadership positions.\n And I also find it important to emphasize emphasize that over-emphasizing differences is not really helpful.\n And I think we meet in the middle of that, because we agree with you that we shouldn't do that.\n And I think it's also important to take a closer look at who the AfD voters are. We know about the 15% in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n We just saw in Thuringia that it wasn't the people who gathered the GDR experience,\n the pensioners voted for the left.\n Who are they?\n And you must always, you must not forget,\n a quarter of the East Germans left the East.\n That means it is not represented in the surveys.\n And that's why I think it's so important to look not only to the east and west, to draw the old borders,\n but to look very closely at who is that, who are these groups and how can we deal with it?\n And above all, to perceive this question as a German question and a German task.\n I would like to include this, because I can't start with this hear it, but I think he explains too little.\n And you brought up exactly the point.\n At the moment we look at Thuringia and see that it is precisely the socialized people in the GDR who have basically saved democracy, namely the over 60-year-olds.\n And the young people have mostly voted for the AfD.\n Then you can't transfer this idea of resistance, of the\n repealing of resistance, at least empirically, in this case.\n And there are also many other things that are explained specifically by the GDR\n and they are very connective. You didn't know democracy, you didn't live through the 68ers, you didn't have this\n anti-fascist protection law against which you rebelled. That sounds plausible,\n but that doesn't explain why the same thing happens in Italy at the same time, the same thing happens in\n France, the same thing happens in Austria. Austria had no GDR. But there are the same developments.\n And that's why I think we, as I said, I think all these debates are right and it needs\n pick-ups, pick-ups that are next to each other. But they also distract us a bit from the core of the question\n why can right-wing populist parties at the same time so many different places with so many different stories at the moment?\n And if we explain it with specific stories all the time, then that blinds our eyes to what is actually happening at the moment.\n I would disagree with that, because I think that all specific stories are very important. You have to look in Germany and look in Italy to see what's there.\n And then you can also see the similarities. I like to hear what you say to me, why European right populism is being elected.\n I'm curious what you say. But I think it also has to be looked at why this situation is in Germany.\n And there are also explanations that are related to the German and Eastern German development. And in Italy there will be specific explanations there.\n So that you look at what is in the respective country and then of course in general European.\n And I don't know in general European.\n Yes, you're right. It's always right, Ms. Neicker, that you say there is a systemic approach that has its justification.\n But to make it clear with another example, the development in 1968, which was a supposedly global revolution,\n as it was described as a world movement, nevertheless had extremely different variations in the different countries.\n So to give an example, and there is an interesting parallel,\n why did the states of Italy, Germany and Japan\n have this kind of radicalism\n in the terrorist movements?\n This also had to do with the past,\n their generation of the breakthrough.\n These are the three states,\n the trias, so to speak,\n who had the fascist strength.\n As global as it is global, it was immediately understood by the movement as world-moving.\n Of course, there were German moments of collapse in 1968, which are also to be explained.\n And I think, to make it clear, of course in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg we have a 15% AfD party.",
      "He didn't have a choice in the end either.\n No, he didn't. But I think you have to understand that to understand the East.\n Why you can't forcefully tell the East now, we need the next big social change now.\n Because 30 years is not a long time to understand what happened then\n and 30 years is not a long time to process it.\n And I also experience it that the generation, my generation,\n the children's generation, carry this process of transformation in themselves to this day.\n And you always have to consider that when you think of the East.\n What does that mean for future politics?\n Does it have to be a special East German policy?\n No, I think that the East is in the middle of it to empower itself\n and not to run after Bauwest, but to make the own sense and the\n the property that the East identity and its own strength.\n At the same time, it also means that from a federalist point of view,\n the East must be supported to be able to live exactly that way.\n And now let's see, what's the name of the group from Aufbruch Ost, Leipzig?\n These are a lot of young people who somehow live the East with art, culture, with politics,\n with their own design of society, of cities, of municipalities and the claim that we belong to this world, so we design it too.\n And I think it's pretty amazing what's happening there.\n And at the same time, of course, you have the areas in the East that are dying out,\n where no one wants to live anymore, where two, three, four, five houses are still inhabited in a village.\n So all of that is the East.\n There are many East German grassroot movements, you just mentioned it today, but in the German elite,\n in the German government, in the federal politics, in the courts, in the universities,\n there is almost nothing. You can count the East German biographies by hand.\n That's right. I think it's starting to grow up now that East Germans can also bring themselves into this position.\n After 30 years.\n After 30 years.\n Well, in the Thuringian politics we also tried to get East Germans into certain leadership positions.\n But that's not easy at all, because such a funny office on the railway is going to be built for the first time.\n And that was quite impossible for East Germans. Especially in the early 90s, so many West German officials came to the East, to Thuringia, to build up the country.\n They are still there today. And this is the generation that is growing out now.\n And you can only hope that the East will establish itself there.\n You have already mentioned the university. I think we have exactly zero rectors or presidents in the Federal Republic.\n In Cottbus there is one.\n Exactly one?\n That's absurd.\n How come?\n On the one hand, I think, these are also hermits.\n West Germans like to give up their jobs to West Germans.\n That's what I just said.\n The conditions of careers, especially in public service,\n are not taken seriously by East Germans.\n I think an extremely different generation is growing.\n Do you think you're taken seriously?\n Yes.\n Why?\n Because I'm taking things seriously.\n But there's a difference between being taken seriously and...\n I think in the last six, seven years I've been able to show that we as the left can do politics really well.\n And that you can do it honestly and clearly. Which as an East German, what perspective can you now\n bring into the party and the federal politics that Janine, your co-chairwoman,\n can't bring in? She's West German. Well, in the East, the principle is always\n I don't know if you know the saying, make shit out of bonbons. You don't know that? But it's nice, right?\n And it's still like that.\n What I can bring in as an East German perspective is\n to do it and not wait.\n It's actually to get something out of every situation\n and it's also the will\n to be heard,\n which we just had before, to be heard.\n And what I also bring with me, I come from the East German Federation of the Left,\n we are currently at around 30%.\n We have led a government, we are setting up a prime minister,\n we have actually changed the lives of people and made their portmonees fuller.\n With clear politics, with clear negotiations with SPD and the Greens."

    "response": "\nLars Feld believes that there isn't a simple trade-off between the economy and health during the pandemic. He thinks that maintaining a low infection rate helps avoid overwhelming the healthcare system and prevents making triage decisions. He supports a no-covid strategy, but acknowledges that it may not be feasible without support from the highest levels of government. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of weighing the economic impact of different measures and ensuring that policies are implemented effectively.",

      "But is the work, as you understand it, of the economist, also of the political economist, who you are, also controlled by the fact that he says we have to recognize crisis symptoms early on and see that we can preventively counter-control a time when the crisis is about to break out.\n Is that the task?\n Yes, we have to recognize in advance what is happening to do something about it,\n so that we do not get such a collapse of the systems.\n What does that mean? That was also a direct question of the following for the crisis we are in.\n The pandemic is directly linked to an economic question.\n How is the No-Covid approach to evaluating the economic and scientific perspective? Three weeks of a hard lockdown and then we can open again compared to what we have had for a year.\n A bit of a lockdown. Where is the damage and the benefit greater?\n That's a more difficult question.\n On the one hand, I have tried to make it clear throughout this Corona pandemic that there is no simple simple goal conflict between economy and health.\n So you have to see very clearly that the health impacts that we have in the\n pandemic would lead to people staying at home even without lockdown, also losing a lot more\n trust and the economic activity would not go on. And we see\n this, for example, also in Sweden. We also see it in historical investigations of other pandemics in the past. So there is no such simple goal conflict.\n What is best done economically is a good anti-pandemic policy.\n So on the one hand to say we are trying to keep the infection rates as low as possible in the waves\n so that our health system does not collapse, i that the intensive care facilities are not overcrowded and that triage decisions are made.\n Because this was really asked, a certain time in the reopening,\n both medically, ethically and economically the right one.\n Yes, I have used myself for this, although you always have to ask again with which instruments.\n So unlike what we had last year, Clemens Fuest now also encouraged the no-covid strategy in this no-covid group, not the border closure.\n And that means, of course, that we could continue to maintain our internationalized value chains.\n That means that this would not belong to this no-covid strategy that we close the industry.\n So not zero covid, no covid is something else.\n Exactly.\n So you are for no-Covid. Absolutely. That means, of course, that I have also emphasized in the discussions, even in the past days, how important, in my opinion, a barrier of exit from higher incidences, i.e. for example an incidence of 100, is.\n And that it can be effective, which we have also seen in various contexts.\n So much that it is currently still empirically disputed. I believe that we would already be able to move forward with such a barrier.\n It was asked about minimum wage, destroy jobs, did not occur.\n Did this lead to a change in your way of thinking?\n No, so again, I have argued against the minimum wage and said that there is a danger that it will cost massive jobs in the interview.\n After that, in the annual report in which we rejected the minimum wage from the board of directors, a prognosis was included that we had made how much the minimum wage would cost in 2015. This is based on 100,000 employment conditions.\n And if you look at the studies that have been conducted today,\n you will find that about 100,000 employment conditions have been lost due to the minimum wage.\n But in view of the very good financial development, this did not play a role at all, because we\n have had so many additional employment conditions in other\n contexts. In this respect, I am always very clear about the prognosis\n and say that the prognosis we made back then was not\n wrong. What I focused on in the interview,\n is also in this rejection of the minimum wage in the annual report,\n if we get a politically driven minimum wage that is set higher and higher,\n and then also more and more working conditions are established that are then no longer profitable for the employer,\n then we also get higher unemployment.\n And that's exactly the problem that I don't want to have.\n At this point I remain critical.\n Today I am also critically critical of a minimum wage of 12 euros, from now to the same time.",
      "The numbers are falling, they are falling slower, but after a while they are falling.\n And I don't see that you need that for this lockdown.\n So rules in the fight against the pandemic work just as they work in all other areas.\n It was then asked, is there actually or would there be an approach from model municipalities, as you have in T\u00fcbingen, for a no-Covid strategy?\n Is that also conceivable or would no-Covid only possible at least nationwide or perhaps even in Europe?\n No, that was actually one of our core ideas, that we work with project municipalities.\n We also have some who came to us when we published the strategy,\n with whom we also exchange ideas regularly and who also want to do that. What you can see very well\n is the limits of the no-covid approach\n if there is no backup from the prime minister. What do you say to people who say\n that's all nonsense, we have to live with the risk, death is part of life, we also have\n no 5 km high speed on the streets that will prevent fatal accidents.\n So the virus accepts that it is part of life and also the fatal consequences.\n The position was also represented.\n Yes, of course. This position exists from the beginning and I would say this position is true without the pandemic.\n So there are life risks, we all wear them, I think they are aware.\n At the same time, it is of course the case that the democracies try to protect their citizens as well as possible.\n So the children ideally wear a bicycle helmet when they ride a bicycle.\n You get stuck in the car, you try to prevent aircraft crashes somehow.\n So it's always the case that you still try to minimize risks.\n Now you have something with the pandemic that is considered\n to be such a fundamental risk by almost 100 percent of all states\n that they all decided to do something about it.\n That's not a German problem.\n And it is the case that for most states, which also have the responsibility to protect their citizens,\n this virus is considered to be unthinkable to let through.\n Because the death toll, mortality and morbidity, i.e. the severity of the processes, will produce an enormous number of victims.\n It is the task of the state to ensure that there is protection.\n The Brazilian head of state doesn't care.\n And how are you? And what kind of head of state is that?\n I ask myself, do we really have to orientate ourselves towards a dictator who says he lets it go\n and we say we are doing it now in Germany too?\n Concretely, it has been asked, for a year now, 95% of the population has been restricted to protecting themselves.\n It is unobtainable how long this will last. Why would this be still acceptable in terms of democracy?\n Because a society has the obligation to protect the weak. That is my position.\n You don't have to do it since one year. It only takes a year because it's done so badly.\n So I would also say that for a year a large part of the population has been kept in quarantine because the state has been unable to cope with this problem sufficiently.\n But in itself, and that is also the problem with the passing of time, that hits certain layers. It's not like the disease hits all people at the same time.\n It hits, for example, those who, due to their socioeconomic status,\n are in a worse health condition anyway.\n It hits the old people.\n Why should we accept that they die just because they are old?\n Yes, so they can live for another two or three years.\n And I read that they otherwise would have a life,\n so the average life time that has been lost, is 10 years.\n We can't afford to decide that it's okay.\n You basically answered one question in three quarters, which was also asked.\n Would a world without precariat and its living conditions be better protected from diseases like Covid-19?\n Do I have to think about it for a moment? So I mean, yes, she would, of course, but the pandemic\n has to be fought in the world in which it takes place and it meets those in the\n society who cannot protect themselves. It does not meet people like me who can lock themselves in their home office for a year.\n But she meets those who are in hospitals, who sit in supermarkets, who have to do delivery services and so on.\n I don't know how you can say that it's okay that it happens and that everyone is responsible for themselves."

One\n says I've actually been there for 12 years and he makes pretty big accusations, especially this one one says\n actually you are completely uncritical and actually more a Chinese than an independent German journalist\n and you would feel softly what actually is going dictatorship in China. I noticed when you said that you said several times that in a country as big as China,\n it simply doesn't work, for example, energy transition or immediate transition to renewable energies.\n And then came a nation that spends 600 billion US dollars on armaments and has a moon travel program.\n It can also make energy changes and teach the citizens to read.\n Is this a typical confrontation among Germans living in China?\n I don't find the arguments convincing at first, because they are making the energy transition.\n They are world champions in solar energy, in wind energy.\n I think they just can't do more.\n It's just not physically possible.\n You need engineers for this and so on and so forth. Then I also said\n quite clearly what I don't like about this system. Quite clear and clear. We\n talked about Xinjiang. In this respect, I don't find the argument of softening the skin is that convincing, to be honest.\n But of course there is always the debate to say, how bad is China actually?\n Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. And my argument is that we have to learn to see both at the same time.\n We have to endure it in this ambivalence.\n That there are at the same time incredible advantages and strengths\n and on the other hand very large, unacceptable human rights violations\n that we have to talk about.\n And everyone who tells that it's just one thing or the other,\n I'm careful about that. We have also got used to such ambivalence in the USA.\n We have the very liberal San Francisco, on the other hand we have the Bible Belt and the\n weapons lobby. We have the Silicon Valley and the Rednecks, we have Trump and California or the liberal east coast.\n And China is similar.\n It's with such a perspective that says, people, let's take a closer look and not binary black and white,\n but look at what is with them, even if they are completely different from us, what about those, where we have to say, isn't that something for us too?",

And to observe that is very interesting.\n Why did you move there?\n It was a coincidence. I actually traveled there and stayed there. There was no big plan behind it.\n How old were you?\n 27.\n Oh.\n Yes.\n Did you just want to go on vacation?\n Yes, I went stay a little longer.\n What was so interesting about 1994 in Peking? So that Frank thinks, I'll stay.\n It was a society in its infancy and you could feel that in every corner. And that you can do a lot of things, that you can design.\n In football, you would say, play in the open space. And that was 1994. So you could feel that at every corner and at every end of this city.\n That you can build something there, that you can develop something.\n Now you say shock Tiananmen, what does that mean?\n Oh, that was the overthrow of the protest movement in 1989. And the square is called Tiananmen Square.\n Why was that a shock? For whom? For the system?\n For all people, of course. That was clear.\n It was a... I don't know why you have to ask the question that it's a shock, because it's actually a matter of course.\n People were shot down by tanks and that was of course a shock for the country.\n Why did people get up then?\n Originally it was an economic crisis with 30% inflation in 1988.\n And then the students sat on top and demanded more freedom, more\n demanded play space. Which you didn't get? Which you didn't get, at least not\n as you wanted. Has there been something like that since then? No. Why?\n That has to do with economic reasons, that there was never a big economic crisis afterwards.\n And the majority of people feel that their personal freedom is constantly increasing.\n And that's why there was no pressure in the bowl. At the end of last year, only a few days, when the protesters held up these white cards.\n But that was only a very small movement, if not in several cities.\n But otherwise, people are busy earning money, making sure that their children have a better education, to travel, to develop their personal freedoms.\n Was that also a movement for more co-determination.\n But it wasn't a constitutional movement for democracy in the narrow sense.\n You didn't wish to have our leader elected?\n That didn't play a central role. It was more about the question of more determination. It remained more vague.\n Basically, you wanted to determine more where it would go.\n Can young Chinese people learn something about the student movement from back then, if they wanted to?\n So could they read something about it in Chinese media or in the internet?\n Not in the censored media, but they could of course download a VPN channel, like many hundred million people do.\n And then they have access to all international media, also in Chinese language.\n That works.\n Do you also do research?\n Yes, sure.\n Is that difficult?\n No. Why?\n It's just a program, you press on and everything is fine.\n I think the least VPR users use it all the time, but we don't need it, do we?\n Exactly.\n Okay. You were 27, you stayed with your family?\n No, back then...\n You mean you went with your girlfriend?\n Yes, but that wasn't family yet. That was my girlfriend and family came much later. So children.\n Now you're almost 30 years old.\n Yes, exactly.\n Do you speak all Chinese fluently? No. My children laugh at me.\n I just got stuck at some point, so to speak.\n If you don't sit down every night and learn for three hours, you won't get any further at some point.\n And I prefer to drink a glass of wine in the evening.\n Do you speak Mandarin?\n Yes, most people speak Mandarin. There are basically only two major languages.\n That is Cantonese, which is spoken in the south, but the main language is Mandarin."

However, she points out that the historical area of Palestina (West Jordan) is inhabited by Palestinians, making it impossible to remove them and maintain a purely Jewish state.",

      "This conflict is solvable, against all assumptions, it is the most unsolvable conflict in the world.\n And yes, and for this you have to create sensitivities.\n I don't know if I can describe this in years.\n As a private person, I don't think that we can still talk about a a two-state solution in ten years,\n if the political determinants don't shift fundamentally.\n And maybe I'll say that briefly, that's something to be considered on both sides.\n We have a political trend in Israel that clearly opposes the two-state solution.\n But we also experience more and more contradictory discourses and debates within Palestinian society,\n which no longer promote this.\n And it is relatively difficult to give these people hope.\n And if you go back to the person of Abbas and the current leadership of Abbas, then this leadership has, especially from an internal perspective,\n a lot of deficiencies that are taking a frighteningly wrong direction.\n We are clearly observing the trend towards authoritarianism.\n There are more and more spaces for civil society, for critical thinking people, for journalists.\n But from an external point of view, if you look at the leadership as a negotiator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\n we have to realize that he is still a very constructive actor.\n I have my doubts that the person or the leadership team that follows him\n is at the same time willing to negotiate and will on initiatives that come from the West.\n And I think these are also elements that you have to consider again and again\n if you are approaching this conflict.\n And briefly to the time window, can you explain to our viewers and listeners\n what would happen if this window was closed for the two-state solution?\n So I think then questions arise that are still pressing on us.\n We have a popular situation here,\n in which the occupying power is responsible for something\n that is currently being managed by the autonomy authority.\n That is, Israel was just before the challenge.\n Does it still make sense to hold on to the autonomy authority,\n which was created as a transition to a Palestinian government within a Palestinian state.\n Which never existed.\n And before I continue, I think you have to remember the term fragmentation, with which I always try to describe the situation here.\n Because we don't have the same situation to describe the entire Palestinian region,\n but each territory, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, can be described differently.\n That's why I also believe that the consequence in Gaza would be completely different.\n A consequence that we will feel much earlier, because I cannot imagine\n that in this very small area with a very high population density\n the situation can remain so calm for a long time.\n The big march, the return, the so-called one that has been going on since the end of March,\n gives us a taste of unrest that can break out there,\n simply when the perspective is completely lost.\n I find it relatively speculative to think about political alternatives\n that then automatically connect.\n Because only when the time window for the two-state solution closes,\n it does not mean that the time window for something else opens automatically.\n But what would it be?\n Permanent occupation or what?\n Well, I mean, of course, we still have the situation that there is a plan from the 70s,\n for example, to think about the fact that there is still municipal self-government.\n But I don't think that's something that can be sold to the Palestinians.\n I also don't think that you can offer anything to the Palestinians at all,\n which lies below, so to speak, your own state.\n And in that respect, I believe that the potential for conflict is of course at its highest,\n but I don't want to get into this deterministic, negative trend that it must inevitably come to a war or a\n uprising, on the contrary, you have to consider the people are extremely tired and exhausted here\n you can see that there are no mass demonstrations here either against the\n Israeli occupation or against the own leadership with which you are just as dissatisfied as with the\n with the consequences of the occupation.\n That is, something is not really forming here and I believe that the people are so much concerned with the question\n how can I still keep my own prosperity, the property I still have, how do I bear responsibility for it, that it may be better for my children.\n Such questions are far more in the focus today than the question of autonomy.\n So in this respect there are many options. It may be that everything just goes on in this calm.",
      "So maybe four years ago there were more and more Palestinians who gave up their own state and said, okay, then we want at least equal rights for all and live in one state.\n How this will be organized in the end is another question, but equal rights for all. From a freedom struggle to a civil rights struggle.\n But the solution sounds a bit like the dream of the right-wing outsiders in Israel.\n We heard that they said to us in the camera, West Jolland must be annexed.\n Yes, that's the idea you have. But they are no longer right-wing dreams, but they have arrived in the middle of the Israeli society.\n And there was now, a few months ago, the new national law in Israel, which basically defines Israel as a Jewish state.\n Now you would think at first, yes, why? It is now known that Israel is a Jewish state. Why do you have to hold on to that? The idea behind it is to prevent exactly what you just described.\n Of course, there are more and more Palestinians in the West Jordan region, in the Gaza Strip, who are completely right to say,\n we won't get our Palestinian state, we won't have it. Where should it go?\n The Israeli settlements have now united all vital parts of the West Jordan region.\n Where should we go?\n So we make a state. Of course course the Jewish Israelis don't want that,\n because they are numerically already in the minority.\n That's completely clear. Then if everyone would say\n one man, one vote, so all people, one voice,\n then it would mean that the Jewish voice\n would be in the minority against the non-Jewish voices. So you don't want that.\n So this national law was\n approved in the sense that it is brought to the surface sense to say that because Israel is a Jewish state, well, there are people with two categories and we rate one category higher than the other.\n So if I am not of Jewish faith, then I have no right to vote in this community.\n On the one hand, you can understand that because then the Jews would indeed be in the minority and then others would determine their fate.\n But the mistake of the Israeli side is that you believe that the entire historical area of \u200b\u200bPalestina,\n i.e. the West Jordan, can be taken into account for itself.\n And that can't work because the Palestinians are there now.\n Whether you like it or not, they are there, they will stay, you can't expel them,\n you can't shoot them on ground and they can't all be\n pushed into the Gaza Strip. That's not good. We have\n devastating living conditions in the Gaza Strip. Now there is always a big problem,\n the drinking water supply, more and more, especially children, are polluted with this\n completely polluted groundwater. It's not enough. The United Nations say that\n the Gaza Strip will no longer be habitable in 2020 due to the salting of the soil.\n And what do we do with the 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip?\n You've been to Gaza.\n Yes, of course. It doesn't look good, it's not nice. It's not possible. It's a prison, you have to be honest.\n It's a free air prison.\n And if you live there, you don't have a chance.\n The stupid thing is, if I'm a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip,\n even if I'm still so moderate, even if I say I'm not interested in politics,\n I'm, let's say, a musician, I'm a respected pianist,\n I'm not interested in politics. I don't care who the government puts,\n should Netanyahu, I want Netanyahu, I don't care, I don't care.\n I want to play the piano, to play the piano."

    "query": "What were the historical reasons for the development of the German social health insurance system, specifically the Bismarck reforms, and how did the role of private health insurance evolve within this system during the 1920s, 1930s, and under the Nazis?",
    "response": "\nThe German social health insurance system evolved from the Bismarck reforms, which were based on the idea of mutual assistance among individuals. Initially, the system consisted of various types of health insurance, including the AOK (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen) for workers and the BKK (Betriebskrankenkassen) for employees. During the 1920s and 1930s, the role of private health insurance grew, particularly with the introduction of the business health insurance, disability insurance, and replacement health insurance. Under the Nazis, the focus shifted towards the AOK, and the system became more centralized. However, the role of private health insurance continued to evolve, with new regulations and reforms being introduced throughout history.",

      "So these are the ones who have contracts with the cash offices, the members must also\n since 1933, 32, be a compulsory member of the\n cash association. And the health insurance association agrees or agrees with the health insurance companies\n on a total allowance, that still applies today.\n That means, the payers, they get it, to put it simply,\n for the number of insured, today, according to their health insurance structure,\n certain total allowances.\n So if a health insurance company, for example, example, has many elderly and chronically ill people,\n then they pay more to the cash register association\n than cash registers with a younger and healthier member structure.\n And the cash register associations then distribute this money\n according to a self-defined fee distribution scale\n to the individual medical practices.\n This is a very complicated system that must be written down annually. The so-called\n evaluation committee of doctors and health insurance companies is responsible for this.\n When did the PKV become a full insurance?\n It has always been. It has always been. That was also the case in most other countries.\n These health insurance systems, as they are today,\n or the health care systems, are mainly...\n You differentiate between beverage systems and Bismarck systems.\n So beverage systems are state-owned health care.\n That's the National Health Service in Great Britain,\n that's also the case in all of Scandin Scandinavia, Italy and Spain.\n So there is no insurance, but everything is financed by taxes?\n Everything is financed by taxes. There is no social insurance as an extra.\n The Bismarck model of social insurance exists in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France,\n and in most Eastern European countries,\n and the Benelux states.\n So the Western European model.\n And the special thing about the German model is that\n we have, besides the separation into private and legal,\n which is no longer available anywhere else.\n So when these systems were introduced everywhere,\n the private businesses were reduced to reduced to the additional insurance.\n There is no more full insurance, although in certain areas it is actually one.\n In England for hospitals and so on. In any case, every citizen is there basically insured either through a social health insurance or through a state-owned care system.\n And that's how it came about after World War II.\n And in Germany, this break was already with the Nazis, which I have already said, in 1934, without me wanting to criticize it now, that was actually a right step to do that, the spare cash, because that was also all employee cash,\n that was the idea, we are now building the whole thing into an employee insurance.\n But the officials remained untouched by it. That was always untouched. Then the Basic Law of the Office Status has also been adopted as to promote and so on.\n That is still said today, if we abolish the welfare system, then we will achieve that with the office status.\n But that's nonsense, because the Basic Law says nothing about it.\n It says in the law of the office that that the state must take care of health care.\n But whether it now takes over 50% of the private insurance or the share of the employer,\n as with other employees in a social health insurance, is actually ultimately irrelevant.\n This is a very irrational debate that we still haven't managed to overcome it.\n But it is a highly complicated matter and I don't know if I will still experience that we have a really full civil insurance.\n In Holland, it took 20 years for this project from the declaration of intent to final realization.\n In 1987, the so-called Decker Plan was set up in Holland and the ISS was finally implemented in 2006.\n So that's really a very, very complex area.\n It's always easy to participate in a debate, but you shouldn't promise that you can implement it from today to tomorrow. So constitutional points of view play a role.\n A very important reason or a very important obstacle on the way to the civil insurance, for example,\n are these retirement benefits.\n That's 240 billion euros.\n From whom?\n Yes, from private health insurance companies.\n So they have their own fund to cover the costs of aging, from which they then cover these costs of increasing age,\n so that no contributions with age-increasing costs are required.\n And so the health insurance contributions are mainly aimed at the age of entry. The later you enter a private health insurance, the more expensive it gets.\n And from a certain age, at least from 45, it is no longer worth it.\n And from 50, the private hospitals hardly take anyone on.",
      "That means it has developed and no political majority has found a way to change it.\n For us, this comes from the Bismarck social law, which I mentioned earlier,\n that the old aid associations were integrated into this system on the basis of mutual assistance.\n At the time, Bismarck originally wanted to have an AOK for everyone, so to speak.\n And it was also by the 1960s, by far, the largest cash system with more than half of the insured.\n In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria they still have more than half of the GKV members still have half of the money. But this led to the addition of the business health insurance, the insurance for the disabled and the health insurance for the disabled.\n And then, in the 1930s and especially in the 1980s, the law, the replacement health insurance, which were all professionally organized.\n So our health care system was professionally organized until 1992, as in system was organized in a professional way,\n like in the old Zunft system.\n That was the 19th century.\n Because depending on whether you were a worker or an employee,\n you had different choices.\n A worker had to go into his duty cash register.\n That was the AOK.\n Or if his employer had a business health insurance,\n into the BKK.\n Or as a craftsman into the health insurance.\n Clumsiness for mountain people was always a special system, which was always a bit different.\n That hardly plays a role today, because where is there still mountain construction outside of Lausitz?\n And that is also an exhaust model. No, these are the historical roots. And that was until 1992.\n And then that was the first big law, no, the second.\n The first was the law of reform of Bl\u00fcm 88,\n that I participated in.\n And then above all the second, the health structure law.\n The free cash vote was introduced for everyone.\n Employees could vote between Barmer and DAK, but for example the\n Technikerkasse only hired engineers. So it was a system of fraud, but really\n had absolutely nothing to do with the modern industrial society and then led to\n huge bans. So at the end of the 80s there were contribution difference between 8 and 17 percent.\n And then the insurance company Steinfurt, that was a worker, sued the Federal Social Court with the help of IG Metall.\n And the Federal Social Court said, we are discriminated because we are workers, we cannot get out of our expensive AOK and go to the cheaper replacement cash.\n And that was then led by the Federal Court of Justice.\n And they have accepted the claim Stantepede, or the norm control procedure,\n and also at the justification why why they accepted it, that this is a sign of success.\n In other words, the politics needed to get into the push.\n And I will never forget how fast that was.\n Thank God we were prepared by the officials.\n That is the core virtue of the official motto of the\n Fahrtfinder, be prepared. That is the core virtue of the official motto of the That's why you have to be prepared and know what to do if suddenly the politics has to have a solution.\n And then we had a system of the free cash election developed in the inquiry commission, where I was already in,\n with a so-called risk structure balance. That is also one of these magic words.\n Above all, morbidity-oriented risk structure compensation. Once a journalist who had survived a stroke meant that since he could talk about the word again,\n he knew that his logopedic rehab would have been successful.\n These are terrible words, word nonsense.\n That means that this morbidity-oriented risk structure that means that every health insurance company that was introduced in 2007 receives as much money as their health insurance company receives.\n Health insurance companies with many chronically ill people receive more from the healthonds mehr. Otherwise, such a system of more integrated systems that\n do not even work for competitive cash registers. So this system with\n several types of cash registers is not quite unique in Europe. This is also available in Holland.\n The Dutch system is generally very similar to ours and also in Switzerland.\n Elsewhere there are either regional unit insurances like in Austria. There are only\n a few small professional works for priests,\n which are completely insignificant.\n There are the so-called regional health insurance companies,\n which would be the AOK for us if Bismarck had gone through.\n And in France there is a completely different system."

What does it look?\n What does economic policy do in Europe?\n I have now read, we have once again saved the ass of a country.\n We want, we want.\n IWF, I read today, has saved Ukraine.\n How is that?\n Well, IWF plans to support Ukraine with a help loan.\n That means Ukraine gets money from the international cash register,\n which countries like Germany and all other countries in the world have also paid for.\n This money is lent to Ukraine as a loan,\n in the hope that Ukraine can continue to finance the business,\n can keep the state alive and then at some point,\n that is also part of the plan,\n if the country is healthy, this money with interest, as it always is, is repaid to the IMF.\n So we earn with money, like Greece?\n Yes, not directly, because it's not about our national banks, but the IMF.\n It's just IMF, not Troika?\n There are no Troika yet.\n Not yet?\n Not yet. It is also planned that other countries can contribute to this. The IMF gives 15-18 billion dollars, not euros.\n And then a few billion will be added.\n The USA, Japan.\n So that there should be 27 in total.\n Why does Ukraine need the money?\n Do they have such high debts? 200%?\n No, not at all.\n The debts are not the problem.\n The debts are actually relatively low, around 40%.\n Lower than in Germany.\n So half as much as Germany, roughly. Only the problem is that, like almost every country, what the state takes in is not enough to finance everything that is to be financed.\n Now also a little war, possibly.\n And the capital markets, the banks, do not lend the country any more money, because you don't know how it will go on.\n And that's why someone has to jump in and fill this gap.\n And in that case it is the EWF.\n But that has nothing to do with the fact that they want to go to Europe, EU,\n and maybe want to have the Euro. They have to have at least 60% of the state debt.\n Yes, the Euro. I don't even know if they want to have it.\n It would be totally crazy if they got the Euro. So, again, a problem case.\n It has something to do with it indirectly, because Ukraine is already the third program now.\n They have already asked for loans twice.\n Both times the program was cancelled because the deposits were not held.\n Actually, you didn't want to make any more money available, but now the West is so strongly engaged.\n When you say we support you, there is a momentum to say, well, then we have to let that cost us something.\n What conditions are being set there? You say 16, 18 million dollars are given there.\n Two years.\n What for? Is there a saying, we help you or we help you with conditions?\n Yes, as always with the IWF, there are conditions that are laid out,\n they are also fixed in the memorandum of understanding,\n so a loan contract, a loan agreement. And it includes structural reforms, labor market, legislation, corruption fight, transparency,\n it includes short-term cuts, it includes above all...\n Austerity or what?\n Yes, exactly.

Sch\u00e4uble said that Greece...\n Our finance minister.\n Our finance minister. He was quoted from Bloomberg.\n I think it would be totally crazy if Ukraine tried to overstep the Greek program.\n Then you can immediately tell the Russians, you don't want to do it, because of course the new government would totally delegitimize.\n And it would probably make the Nazis more angry.\n Example Greece? For example Greece.

You can't save the country.\n But Ukraine has a state deficit of about 10%.\n So the gap between a country and a state deficit...\n Somehow you have to make sure that you can't just live on pump for a long time.\n But you get there and then you're right, of course.\n You can try to shorten everything, then the economy goes worse,\n then you take in less and the hole gets bigger and bigger.\n That's why it comes down to the right balance.\n But that a country can't go on like it has been before,\n when it's just 10% in the weeds, I think that's also clear. That, if it just puts 10% in the mire.\n I think that's also clear.\n That's why it comes down to how clever the program is.\n And you can hope that you learn from it.\n The hot topic there are the gas prices.\n And we can talk about that right away.\n That's where it will show, above all.\n Explain to us, how has Ukraine, in the last decades,\n since it has been independent,\n how have they supplied themselves with energy?\n They provided themselves with cheap gas from Russia.\n And the gas itself was not only cheap,\n it was also subsidized by the state.\n That means that there were subsidies for households.\n They didn't have to pay the full gas price, which was already low, but in addition the state took part of the costs, so that energy was really extremely cheap.\n I also learned in Ukraine that the state took over everything.\n At the time, but also completely taken over."

The Bayer employees are 100,000, probably also many of your voters.\n How did your Bayer-Concern develop or produce zero vaccines in two years?\n First of all, the production and development of vaccines has never been a focus of Bayer.\n Other companies have been stronger there.\n Bayer has other focus points.\n Bayer has actually supported the production of the BioNTech vaccine.\n But in fact, Bayer is not a vaccine company, to put it that way.\n BioNTech has now taken the lead, right?\n BioNTech is extremely successful and will continue there.\n Sanofi, GSK are also coming up strongly, also Moderna.\n So there are a number of companies that have shown what they can do in the vaccine development.\n And Bavaria has other key points, but is not really strong.\n I have one more naive suggestion.\n I mean, it is unrealistic that the patent release is coming,\n because Germany is blocking it on a global level.\n Not only that, it was not the impression I wanted to make.\n But also, we are one of the main blockers. Adam Tooze is a well-known historian from Great Britain, he made another suggestion.\n Why doesn't Germany play a world savior?\n There are about 5 million people who still need an vaccination.\n 5 billion.\n 5 billion, sorry, 5 billion, they need 3 doses.\n That means we need 15 billion doses.\n You could use Biontech to calculate, each dose costs 10 euros. Then you can\n calculate that we are at about 150 billion euros for the whole world so that it is vaccinated.\n Why doesn't Germany do that? Why don't we take on debt for that? Don't we only\n promote our own economy with it? Because the money then flows into the German pharmaceutical companies\n and at the same time we have a global economy without a pandemic, which would benefit Germany the most.\n The bottle neck is not the money for the vaccines at the moment, but the vaccines themselves, the production.\n The production capacities that are currently there will never make it possible. There are three problems here, to make it short.\n And then I come to the question,\n money always plays a role, and what we do.\n I don't want to change the subject,\n but there are three problems with the proposal.\n The first problem is that we, if we wanted,\n wouldn't have produced the production in this order.\n The production plants that would be able to do this,\n to provide 5 billion doses of vaccine in time,\n which would then have to be given in multiple doses,\n that would be a total of 10 or 15 billion doses,\n that doesn't exist at the moment.\n The companies are currently having difficulties\n to get the next batch of old and new vaccines, Omicron or combination."

    "response": "\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, the experiences of individuals born in East Germany faced challenges related to the perceived devaluation of their livelihoods, loss of jobs, and being considered a threat to the social network. These experiences led to feelings of being marginalized and different from the hegemonic groups in West Germany. Additionally, they were often subjected to stereotypes, such as being labeled as \"complainers\" and accused of not distancing themselves enough from extremism. Furthermore, the process of reunification created a sense of competition between East and West Germans, leading to a struggle for recognition and acceptance within the new unified Germany.",

      "So I spent about 20 years there, more than I am anywhere else.\n And in fact it is so that I personally never felt East German\n or never wrote this category to me. We have just a little bit of that,\n you might analyze and evaluate it differently now, but I never felt it and I\n also believe that a lot of people of my generation don't see it that strongly.\n We have in the initiative that we have founded, we are the East, which also asks people, do you actually feel East German?\n And there too noticed, so a third says no, the rest yes.\n And especially the younger ones, who no longer really experienced the GDR and grew up there, they say rather no, I don't feel East German. And it came to the point that it never really bothered me\n until there was a change in the political landscape.\n And suddenly the East was spoken of and actually the right-wing extremist voters were meant.\n And that was a situation where I thought, hey, I don't think that's cool,\n because somehow that's part of me.\n And actually this is, we are the East, a reaction to the East.\n I think there are a lot of people who have participated who say, I don't stand for the East or I don't feel that way now.\n But it's a reaction to these descriptions that have happened in the media.\n And in your case, if you may say a few sentences about yourself, it is particularly remarkable.\n You are a diploma psychologist, you also jumped into the world very quickly.\n You lived in Sydney very quickly, I think, after school.\n And interestingly enough, you never understood yourself as an East German.\n You were a North German, whether the fact that you lived in Rostock, if you didn't feel like a European or a citizen of the world.\n Now I can introduce myself to two sentences. I am in the year 1967, in my generation, many immediately felt as Europeans and later as citizens of of the world because they did not want to feel\n German and that is the exciting question for me I found the question and that\n I think the actual politics what interests me how he discusses it is certainly discussed\n what is actually the reason today and I have also seen many who have reported, who are even younger than 89, primarily want to feel like East Germans, West Germans.\n And you said it yourself, in your description the description as German was not decided.\n That is explanatory for me. And isn't that perhaps even an appropriation policy of the term East German, I'll put it in a polemic way, that plays against your intention with the East, which the AfD also operates,\n because it doesn't claim what we should all be together, namely German.\n That's a bit of the question. I think that's exciting.\n How does this topos of identity politics, which is actually written to the other side,\n which claims for itself, we are the East, you say it now too.\n Isn't that something that draws wrong boundaries? Especially with people who could perhaps formulate completely different identities even more primarily?\n As I said, it is above all a reaction to the developments.\n And I think we live in a time\n where a lot of people go abroad after graduating.\n And I don't know, I was actually asked,\n what is your first description?\n Where do you see yourself first when it comes to nationality?\n And I would say Europeans.\n And I don't know, who would say Europeans?\n And who sees seen as German?\n So about half and half. That's a problem, to be clear.\n I say that very clearly.\n And I'll tell you why.\n That's the fight for occupation.\n I can say it too bluntly, we can argue about it later.\n Maybe others have exciting considerations about it.\n I think, to be clear,\n that we have left the AfD the flag of black, red and gold.\n The flag of democratic Germany.\n Because nobody wants to admit to this Germany and this Federal Republic that we are all.\n This is a dramatic problem because it is a recognition of the fact that today,\n that would be my position, it is no longer about the occupation of any regional space.\n I think it's about the occupation and the defense of this entire country.\n That's why I find that irritating. And I think we would have other battle lines there. That would be my question.\n I'll make it even more controversial.\n The GDR didn't know the countries.\n It didn't know any countries.\n The countries were added later.\n But they were much earlier dates.",
      "That was the approach. Then we made a approach across East Germany.\n It went like this. Many East Germans experienced a devaluation of their livelihoods, lost their jobs and were considered a threat to the social network.\n Many migrants also lost their industrial locations and jobs.\n I can't remember the exact frame.\n But we wanted to know if the answers to Islamist hostility were less.\n They are not. The design didn't work.\n We'll have to look again at some point when we have time,\n why it just doesn't work, even though it says in the research that it should work.\n Maybe the stories were too long, it doesn't work on the phone.\n That was put aside, but back then we collected a lot of stories from East Germany,\n where we wanted to test these evaluation experiences.\n So it was, if you will, coincidence. Then we have a colleague at Humboldt University, Daniel Kubiak,\n who has been promoting East German identity at this time and has also conducted a lot of qualitative\n interviews, as I have just explained, i.e. deep interview analyses, where people discuss things broadly and not only quantitatively,\n where they name click-click-click items on the phone.\n And with that we developed certain stereotypes that East Germans are always confronted with.\n One stereotype that was very strong was the stereotype of the complaining Aussies at the time.\n That you say, they just complain, look what you have brought them, look here, Dresden looks nicer than Hagen, why are they actually complaining all the time?\n That was one thing. The other thing he said that was very strong was the accusation of not arriving in today's Germany.\n What we concluded was interesting.\n This is also what is accused of migrants over generations.\n So obviously one believes that today's Germany is a closed unit\n and the East Germans have to work their way into it.\n And the other accusation was not to distance oneself enough from extremism.\n In the interviews it was repeatedly said that the brown east overlaps everything,\n that you always have to give yourself a kind of distance before you start talking.\n And we had previously researched this with Muslims,\n who also said that it annoys them\n that every word I start, every debate I start,\n has to start with a distance.\n I also don't like Al-Qaeda or something else.\n I'm a Muslim, but I also don't like Al-Qaeda.\n And that came from the East German side too,\n that they had the East German side too,\n that they had the feeling that they had to introduce any discussion.\n I come from the East, but I am also against racism.\n And from that, such aha moments first came to mind,\n where we thought, interesting, we should test that,\n whether that really is the case or is that just a perception.\n That is very, very central and very important for what happens in post-migrant society.\n First of all, to recognize that the things these people feel are not just pure feeling.\n For this we need these empirical numbers.\n Because as long as it is a pure feeling that the children of the second generation say, we were sent to primary schools on a flat basis if we had a Turkish or Arabic name,\n then it is always just a private anecdote.\n And always someone says, okay, a teacher helped me, a neighbor helped me.\n But when we find out, yes, that's so flat,\n then that first raises it out of the sensitive space. So we tested it and found out, look at it, look at it,\n in fact, about 40 percent of West Germans in all three stereotypes\n accuse the East Germans of it, namely to present themselves as victims,\n not having enough themselves from extremism\n and not having arrived in today's Germany.\n And surprisingly, we found that they are presenting this to Muslims in a similar degree.\n So we tried to make this bridge or this analogy, the comparison.\n I find it interesting that both groups are actually evaluated by the West Germans.\n Are the West Germans the problem then? Well, it's like I just said, there are\n hegemonic groups and there are marginalized groups. Hegemonic means that you are above all\n central structures in politics and society, that you can strongly influence the education canon,\n that you have, so to speak, the power of speakers, that you can speak and hegemony actually means\n that this group is seen as the normal group. We also did surveys in it. Would you\n rather call yourself German or West German? Would you rather call yourself German or West German?\n Would you rather call yourself German or East German?"

No, I refused the military service back then and then did civilian service in the Evangelical\n Academy in Bad Segelberg. How could you refuse the military service?\n That was a bit easier back then. There were times when it was really hard and difficult.\n But back then it was really easy.\n But why did you want to deny it?\n Why did I want to deny it? From a fundamental pacifist attitude.\n You could have checked if your pacifist attitude to reality fits.\n Yes, of course. But I mean, as humans we are also used to learning from the experiences of others.\n And you don't have to try everything yourself.\n You don't have to grab the hard drive with your hand to know that it's stupid.\n And where was the civil service?\n Evangelische Akademie Bad Segeberg.\n What was that?\n It was a day care,\n care for youth groups, but also somehow support at day care,\n support gardeners and so on.\n It was very pleasant.\n So then came the studies.\n Did you study history?\n History, politics and Germanism. I actually started with VWL and thought VWL could be something for me.\n But I realized relatively quickly that I had imagined the direction differently.\n Everything was very focused on a purely market-economic and neoliberal theory at that time.\n And there were few professors who saw it differently.\n Yes, but the market view has been through.\n Yes, it has already been through at that time.\n With 1989 capitalism won and as the philosopher Francis Fukuyama said, it was the end of the story.\n Exactly.\n Exactly.\n Done.\n We can stop with the interview.\n Exactly.\n Good.\n But even if you had a problem with it, you could have done it again at the Bundeswehr.\n You just look at it and understand it, understand it fine and so on.\n Yes, also a nice idea there was\n actually once I think also in the 60s 70s years a link in the Bundeswehr to learn the service\n on the weapon somehow and to get in there and understand the enemy but I don't think so\n much about it I prefer to make the Bundeswehr superfluous in the long run.\n There's always a running gag in the interviews that says that the young people of Fridays for Future should go to the CDU.\n And the CDU from below. You need a few thousand of some East German federal associations and then you have a majority. Exactly, there were such attempts with the FDP here in Berlin, I think there was also\n an attempt to enter mass and take over the FDP and then somehow make it into an interesting\n party or something.\n But I don't know.\n Or the left.\n Go to the left and cram the left.\n Do you need that or is it perfect?\n The left is the perfect party, all in well known. No, it's not.\n You go into a party, ideally with a certain position, and look at yourself.\n Okay, I might have 70, 80 percent agreement, that could be something. And yet there are things that have to be changed and where you want to change positions, where you want to change structures, for the meeting as a bit of the processing of the agenda.\n agenda point 1 welcome, agenda point 2 protocol of the last meeting, farewell, protocol and so on and so forth.\n Top 12 then different.\n And there is a lot of time spent on it, where you could actually see that you can find a better balance between going out, doing actions, convincing people and working out the agenda.\n But you ended up with the Greens first, right?\n I ended up in the youth. But then in 1998 we had a party and celebrated Rot-Gr\u00fcn and hoped that it wouldn't get so bad and that the Oscar would be a bit corrective to Schr\u00f6der and that Schr\u00f6der would not go through with his line, which was already a bit recognizable at that time. And that the Greens are also a corrective, but\n unfortunately that turned out to be a bit like Father Morgana.\n What particularly disturbed you?\n The Kosovo War,\n the reason for this war,\n the contract of Romboyer, the Huf-Eisenplan, but also Joschka Fischer with\n I have not only learned never again war, but also never again Auschwitz.",
      "I can't remember ever looking for a parking space.\n They always existed.\n And it was a very lively student life.\n And then came the politicization in the mid-60s,\n which I only participated as a spectator,\n so I always read in the newspaper,\n so there were demonstrations.\n Against or for what? So,, I remember, people demonstrated, I wasn't there at all.\n In front of a cinema, a film was shown, I think it was called Afriko Adia or something like that.\n Afrika Adio? Adio, yes. It was about colonial relations in Africa.\n People there demonstrated against the imperialists,\n who had done bad things to the African people there.\n They were very engaged.\n They called it anti-imperialism at the time. And the SDS, the German Socialist Student Union, became more and more famous at the time,\n who then organized these demonstrations.\n And I myself then acted politically for the first time after June 2, 1967,\n when Benno Ohnesorg was shot. And in the night when that happened,\n when he was shot by a policeman after a demonstration,\n and not by chance, but specifically.\n Killed.\n You have to say killed.\n It was spread that not a student was killed,\n but that a policeman was stabbed by a student.\n And that gave the police the necessary motivation to go against these students.\n It all made me so upset, even though it was presented like that the next day,\n up to the governor, not just the police, as if the students were the bad guys.\n And I was there myself, also in the vicinity, and when they were flowing away after the beating had started, I also talked to them, so I got everything told very warmly. I was so upset about it that I said,\n now I'm getting involved, I was already a referee,\n and offer my help to the then APU lawyer,\n the famous APU lawyer Thorsten Mahler.\n I then joined his office,\n did legal work as a referee, also did processes,\n represented and defended an infinite number of students in court.\n How long did this student movement last? When was it over?\n It lasted until the early 70s.\n I radicalized myself, I took a Marxism course.\n By the way, the teacher in a Marxism, by the way.\n It was a Social Democrat, a Juso, I think he was the Juso chairman at the time.\n He was later appointed as bank director at a bank.\n I learned my basics about Marxism from him.\n And then I got involved.\n I didn't up any demonstrations.\n There were several demonstrations a week against the establishment.\n I was involved in these things and was convinced in 1969 that we need a revolution in Germany.\n Against the old Nazis, against the Vietnam War.\n Those were the main arguments.\n You can't imagine that at all, but all around us,\n in my childhood and my youth, there were the old Nazis.\n Everywhere you looked.\n The professor, who I heard in Heidelberg,\n Forsthoff was, who was in charge of administration,\n was also a respected professor in the Nazi era and wrote a book about\n why the leadership state is actually the most liberal.\n And we sat down and he didn't ask him to do it, but he was very willing\n and then taught us the right to rule.\n I only learned about it years later.\n And so it was everywhere around us.\n When I was a referee, the only judge of the Volksgerichtshof,\n which had ever been put in court in Germany, in Berlin,\n was told that he was involved in 30 or 40 murders,\n murders you could say,\n so death sentences of the People's Court.\n And he was standing there in front of the Berlin Court of Appeal.\n And those were cases where the death sentence\n was announced after a negotiation of half an hour,\n three quarters of an hour.\n And the chairman of the court, that's how it was, that was in the files after the consultation.\n You know how they went, you could see that in the film later.\n Just said, down there, down there, and then the others didn't care, they went out again and announced the verdict.\n And they saw that as the right courts and he was acquitted in 1968,\n because the judges said, well, that was valid law back then."

      "This conflict is solvable, against all assumptions, it is the most unsolvable conflict in the world.\n And yes, and for this you have to create sensitivities.\n I don't know if I can describe this in years.\n As a private person, I don't think that we can still talk about a a two-state solution in ten years,\n if the political determinants don't shift fundamentally.\n And maybe I'll say that briefly, that's something to be considered on both sides.\n We have a political trend in Israel that clearly opposes the two-state solution.\n But we also experience more and more contradictory discourses and debates within Palestinian society,\n which no longer promote this.\n And it is relatively difficult to give these people hope.\n And if you go back to the person of Abbas and the current leadership of Abbas, then this leadership has, especially from an internal perspective,\n a lot of deficiencies that are taking a frighteningly wrong direction.\n We are clearly observing the trend towards authoritarianism.\n There are more and more spaces for civil society, for critical thinking people, for journalists.\n But from an external point of view, if you look at the leadership as a negotiator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\n we have to realize that he is still a very constructive actor.\n I have my doubts that the person or the leadership team that follows him\n is at the same time willing to negotiate and will on initiatives that come from the West.\n And I think these are also elements that you have to consider again and again\n if you are approaching this conflict.\n And briefly to the time window, can you explain to our viewers and listeners\n what would happen if this window was closed for the two-state solution?\n So I think then questions arise that are still pressing on us.\n We have a popular situation here,\n in which the occupying power is responsible for something\n that is currently being managed by the autonomy authority.\n That is, Israel was just before the challenge.\n Does it still make sense to hold on to the autonomy authority,\n which was created as a transition to a Palestinian government within a Palestinian state.\n Which never existed.\n And before I continue, I think you have to remember the term fragmentation, with which I always try to describe the situation here.\n Because we don't have the same situation to describe the entire Palestinian region,\n but each territory, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, can be described differently.\n That's why I also believe that the consequence in Gaza would be completely different.\n A consequence that we will feel much earlier, because I cannot imagine\n that in this very small area with a very high population density\n the situation can remain so calm for a long time.\n The big march, the return, the so-called one that has been going on since the end of March,\n gives us a taste of unrest that can break out there,\n simply when the perspective is completely lost.\n I find it relatively speculative to think about political alternatives\n that then automatically connect.\n Because only when the time window for the two-state solution closes,\n it does not mean that the time window for something else opens automatically.\n But what would it be?\n Permanent occupation or what?\n Well, I mean, of course, we still have the situation that there is a plan from the 70s,\n for example, to think about the fact that there is still municipal self-government.\n But I don't think that's something that can be sold to the Palestinians.\n I also don't think that you can offer anything to the Palestinians at all,\n which lies below, so to speak, your own state.\n And in that respect, I believe that the potential for conflict is of course at its highest,\n but I don't want to get into this deterministic, negative trend that it must inevitably come to a war or a\n uprising, on the contrary, you have to consider the people are extremely tired and exhausted here\n you can see that there are no mass demonstrations here either against the\n Israeli occupation or against the own leadership with which you are just as dissatisfied as with the\n with the consequences of the occupation.\n That is, something is not really forming here and I believe that the people are so much concerned with the question\n how can I still keep my own prosperity, the property I still have, how do I bear responsibility for it, that it may be better for my children.\n Such questions are far more in the focus today than the question of autonomy.\n So in this respect there are many options. It may be that everything just goes on in this calm.",
      "Not two states, not one state. I would like to ask something, because somehow we are just, I just heard, I don't know,\n we got so confused. So it was just about the question of the two-state solution\n and why, for example, Palestinian flags are criminalized, although it is actually part of one of the two states. I just think that in Germany there is no serious\n dealing with the situation\n ever really happened.\n So I just think that this is a topic that is being avoided.\n It is an uncomfortable topic, you can burn your fingers on it.\n You never really want to talk about Israel and Palestine and the realities on site.\n And that was, well, now it's an exceptional situation anyway, but I'm already talking about the time before October 7th,\n when friends wanted to write their master's thesis on the impact of settlement policy on climate change.\n And then the professor says, why don't you just go for another topic, Israel and Palestine,\n that will destroy your career. So that was just a topic for a long time, or maybe always\n even a topic that was better not to touch on. And that's just flying around\n a bit in Germany, because I get a lot of messages,\n also from teachers, for example, who say they can't get along with their students,\n they are totally overwhelmed with questions that children ask in school,\n and they don't even know what to answer.\n Now, suddenly, you notice in this country\n that you should have dealt with the situation earlier.\n And now everyone is totally helpless and is looking for experts\n who give workshops or do social work with young people in New Cologne.\n Which you could have done much earlier.\n That's one point.\n The other point I wanted to say is, I think that a lot of what German politics says,\n like what politicians do in general, are just false promises.\n Because I'm also convinced that, as I said earlier, there can't be security for one of the two peoples in this country,\n if the other people are not safe.\n Or to put it more clearly, I think the state of Israel cannot be safe if there is no safe state for Palestinians.\n And I think as long as that is not there, there will always be violence and it will get worse and worse.\n I think if the German politics were seriously concerned about Israel's security,\n they would exert much more pressure to achieve an end to the military occupation,\n to have a Palestinian independent state.\n Because that would be the basic requirement, in my opinion, to have a If I would say that the security of the State of Israel is German state reason,\n that is the official position since Merkel,\n then that would actually mean, according to what you say,\n if the security of Israel is German state reason,\n then the German state reason belongs to the massive entry for an independent Palestinian state,\n because without it there is no safe state of Israel.\n I wouldn't say that and I'm not...\n Shame.\n I'm not... I don't think that Germany will play the essential role.\n Because Germany will probably always remain reserved because of its past.\n That's okay, Germany is not the only player in the game.\n The USA are probably much more important than Germany. But my point is that I want to make, I believe that there will be violence again and again\n and that there will be no security, neither for Israelis nor for Palestinians,\n as long as there is no Palestinian protection and a state of its own,\n that the two-state solution will very, very likely never be implemented,\n because we have watched for decades how facts on the ground have been created, so to speak,\n which have actually made it impossible by now. That's another point. But from my experience in the West Jordan country, I have worked a lot with international institutions and German institutions and so on on site.\n So no one who seriously lives and works in the West Jordan country still believes in the two-state solution.\n So really nobody. And even more absurd that it is still propagated while we are still moving away from it.\n We have been dealing with this conflict for 8-9 years. On both sides there were voices who said the same thing as we did. there can be no security for Israel without a security for Palestinians.\n And it doesn't exist without, and that's the fundamental point, without an end to the occupation.\n So the dominance of one side over the other.\n The oppression of the Palestinians for decades. Would you agree with that? Yes, definitely. I think there are many empty sentences that are said these days."

We went back to Sana'a.\n As I said, we spoke to the police.\n You are allowed to join the government.\n Very briefly, are these the Houthis?\n Exactly.\n These Houthis call themselves the supporters of Allah. Exactly. These hoodies are called Unterst\u00fctzer Allahs, their official name, as they like to be called.\n Okay.\n In any case, they said, no, we don't want to.\n I mean, you're making a fuss and don't want to govern. What else do you want?\n Somehow they don't know what they're... What else do you want to do? You have to imagine that these are young people like you and me.\n For politics you also need older people who think a bit clearer than young people.\n But these are really people between 20 and maybe 35 years old.\n And these are the people who made politics.\n So that you can understand these dimensions first, how they tick.\n Not against young people, I'm still myself, but politics needs older people.\n You say they were quite young and naive, right? Well, I didn't want to say that, but you just said it.\n Anyway, it really went wrong.\n At some point, the president and the minister-president and his cabinet were put under house arrest.\n They were not allowed to walk on the streets anymore.\n The president then declared a retreat.\n This retreat still has to be approved by the parliament according to the constitution.\n Yes.\n The joke is, the rebels had six wars against the former president, but then the dictator, the former dictator and the rebels worked together.\n Who is the former dictator?\n Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n Although they are enemies, he has some hope that he will return to power. He was dismissed by the Arab League.\n The former president has the majority in parliament.\n Of course, as you said, they are young and naive.\n If they were clever, they would have said that the parliament should sit together and accept the retreat.\n But because they are young and naive, they didn't do that.\n That means that until then, he is still a legitimate president, because the parliament hasn't confirmed it yet.\n Because the Libyans and the former president didn't agree to it.\n Okay?\n So, the former president could then flee to Aden.\n And from there, the chiefs of the president,\n the Libyans said no, there is no president anymore because he declared his resignation.\n The people who have the constitution and so on said no, the parliament has not gathered.\n And besides you and them, the parliament itself, they have declared their resignation. They didn't explain it to you. This militia.\n That means we don't have a government, no parliament, we only have one president and these militias.\n So, the militias are angry, they want to follow the president to the end of the world.\n That means to the south. I mean, you know what the South Yemen is.\n South Yemen was something like East and West Germany. So I am a Northlander, so I come from the North Yemen.\n And there is the South Yemen. We were two different states.",
      "So, we had an army, which was built by the former president for his protection. Okay. The Sal\u00e9, not the...\n The expert, exactly.\n The Sal\u00e9 or the Hadi?\n The dictator.\n Okay, okay.\n Sal\u00e9.\n He has his family around him,\n he has brought them into important positions there,\n so that he knows that no putsch can happen. The Special Forces, the American Guard, the Anti-Terror Guard, and so on, these important things belonged to his son.\n These are the best armed and trained soldiers.\n He also had rockets, scat rockets, if you know what I mean.\n Anyway, I also need to drink something. Cheers!\n Cheers! We don't drink coke, we drink juice. After the fall of the former president, they said...\n Sorry, there was another part of the army that belonged to Ali Mohsen.\n He was the one who passed away during the Arab Spring has passed.\n And then they said, this army is wrongly built, we have to rebuild it, we have to reform it.\n We were all happy, we were happy for the country and so on...\n ...for certain individuals...\n The problem is, the only thing that was freed...\n ...is the part of the army that...\n ...has been overrun.\n The revolution.\n Exactly.\n That... ...is that gone again?\n No.\n Oh no.\n It seems that it happens every 10 minutes that Momo is gone again. You see as much or less as I do, but that can only be done in one or two minutes.\n If you have questions for Mohamed, just write to me on Twitter.\n That's the fastest way.\n So write to me on Twitter if you have any questions for Mohamed,\n the perhaps only and last German in Yemen. If you have any questions, this is probably the best time to ask them.\n I'll check Twitter.\n So, I'm back. You! So, did you understand what I mean?\n As I said, the newly formed army was the army that had been overthrown.\n It was newly formed, it was scattered everywhere, so that it no longer had the former president, fighting the militia.\n Because they were loyal to the former president.\n So that means that was a bit like, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n Exactly.\n But the funny thing is, they were enemies for the last nine years.\n To make it clear, the founder of the militia was killed by Saleh.\n The new chief of the militia is the brother of the killed.\n But they cooperated together. There was a phone call between Saleh and the high leader of the militia.\n They are still in the war.\n In politics, they say there are no constant friendships, nor constant enemies.\n There are common interests, or not.\n That's what makes politics simple.\n We've already learned that.\n It's also here.\n Sweet.\n Tell us something.\n I'm done. I would like to know who the Houthis are, who these militias are. What do we need to know about them? They are not Al Qaeda, right?\n No, no, that's the other side. You have to be careful.\n Go ahead. I have a Facebook page with a Houthi and an Al-Qaeda and I said, everyone wants to free us from the others.\n Do you understand?\n The two of them are fighting and they say, we can fight each other for your own good.\n I can really give not fight this fight.\n Al-Qaeda are Sunnis, I am also Sunni, but I am not Al-Qaeda, but we are Sunnis.\n And the Houthis are Shiites.\n So these are two different poles. Of course the Al-Qaeda, sorry, the Houthis are very close to Iran.\n Iran supports them directly and indirectly.\n Of course you know the stress between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n Yes, they are enemies of the earth.\n Exactly. And Saada, the province I just told you about, borders Saudi Arabia.\n And Iran supports the Houthi rebels to annoy the Saudis. Clever. to simply say that they are annoying or disturbing.\n Clever.\n Sometimes politics is really...\n You can explain it easily, but that's really the case.\n That you understand how the Houthis work, they are very... how should I say...\n I have Houthis from my family. They are Sa'idites, so the Shiites.\n They think, for example, what anno don't think that a follower of the prophets has more right than I do."

      "Yes.\n Why?\n That's the way it is. It's a compulsory membership for the time ... as long as you ...\n You have to find shit as a liberal.\n Yes, that's why I say yes. But in case you are legally insured patient\n you can say, I don't do it, I'll let myself down on the green lawn,\n you can do that at any time. And I say, you can say I don't do it, I'll let myself down on the green grass, you can do that anytime.\n And I say who comes, gets a bill from me, has to pay it. Whether you get it back from the cash register is not my problem.\n You can do that, there are colleagues who do that.\n So I can have a practice and only private patients?\n Yes.\n Then I don't need to work with you?\n Then you are not included with us.\n Unlike the chamber, the membership of the medical chamber, you can't escape it. I have the doubtful pleasure of even being a member of two chambers, namely in D\u00fcsseldorf and in Berlin, because I am registered in both federal states and I am thus a member of the chamber in Berlin and North Rhine.\n What was the but now with the compulsory membership with you? If I want to treat legally insured patients and also calculate them,\n then it's only about the cash-in-injury agreement, because then we are back at the\n collective agreement of 31, which is the contractual body. So I am then in this\n community of cash-in-injury doctors and they will be represented by the cash-injury agreement.\n And as soon as I stop doing that, so to speak, I stop tomorrow, I am also out of the cashier association.\n Could cashiers and cashiers who are dissatisfied with you, with the leadership and so on,\n could they found a counter-organization? And say we'll do it better, we'll take care of ...\n In principle not, because we are legally anchored. What there is,\n the legislator himself did that, actually led by Ola Schmidt.\n He said, well, we don't find these insurance associations so prickly if they are too powerful.\n We create a separate honor area where doctors can treat legally insured patients past the insurance association,\n if they sign so-called selective contract over their respective health insurance companies.\n Interestingly, however, someone who signs a selective contract must still be a member of a health insurance association.\n So in that respect, it was not executed consistently back then, but that's at least a niche that exists.\n How did you get up there? Why did they choose Andreas Gassen as boss at some point?\n That's a good question.\n Was there a election campaign?\n Yes, there was a real election campaign.\n So it's like that.\n Are there only men in your company?\n No.\n Was there ever a woman at the top?\n Yes.\n I am now the chairman of the second legislature and my co-chairwoman was a housewife from Thuringia.\n Okay.\n So we had a 50% female quota in the boardroom.\n And we actually have many women in leadership positions in Berlin,\n in our department of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.\n But it's not always like that.\n I sometimes have a lot of colleagues who don't want this body number.\n That may be deceiving.\n I think it's good if they would do more.\n But it's not a pure men's association. You've been at the top since 2014. Why did you do it? Why did you want to do it? Because of the salary?\n No, obviously not. It was a situation, I was delegated to Berlin as a member of the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung Nordrhein.\n That's a bit complicated now.\n The Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung elects a representative association from its members and they elect a board member.\n That means these are all active colleagues.\n Each Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung, that is legally regulated, then quotas to Berlin in the Kassen Kassen-Essi-Bundesvereinigung\n representative meeting. 60 people in the number. So that's a bit like Meck-Pomm H2, Nordrhein\n for example 5. And they then choose a board from their 60. He doesn't have to come from\n this circle, we can also take someone from the external.",

And I was in this representative meeting\n and at that time the former chairman of the board had a heart attack and could no longer exercise his office ad hoc.\n And then you needed a successor.\n And then he thought about it and thought about different options and then decided for me.\n Why did you do that?\n Are you such a big-mouthed person or what?\n I don't know.\n You can argue well.\n My sense of belonging, I think that was the problem back then, it was a very tense situation between different currents and to fill the graves a little bit, because I didn't have such a past from the system, so old animosities were not located with me in that form.\n What different trends are there at the KBV?\n Not so much anymore, but back then in the old days there was a very strong politicization between house and specialist doctors.\n It was, as you can imagine, mostly about money.\n It was the question back then, do the house or the specialist get too much or too little money.\n And then, for me, it became so self-sufficient that it actually made it difficult to work together in many ways.\n And the normal medical activity is not a house or specialist, but a joint one.\n And I think that was the reason why I saw someone in me who didn't bring that many old-timers.\n And that's how I got it.\n Do you have old-timers now?\n Well, well.\n Your name is now well known, right?\n Yes, we don't call them old-timers, but the longer you're in such an area, the more...\n Do you think you'll be voted again?\n That's what my colleagues will decide when the election starts. Do you want to will be elected again? My colleagues will decide that when the election is up.\n Would you like to do it again?\n I would do it again if they would elect me again.\n In the last episode, Gernot Marks was the president of the DVI.\n He does it for a living. Why don't you do it for a living?\n Why do you get half a million?\n That is actually a legal mistake.\n It was actually a job for civil service. You'll laugh. Until 2007, I think, it was professionalized.\n Before the election, the board of directors had five or seven heads and they were civil service colleagues from the KVN. So that's actually how it was established by the legislator.\n But the legislator doesn't say how much you earn?\n No.\n You decide for yourself that I pay you so much?\n Yes.\n Could you change that? If someone says, you can imagine, we got a lot of mail from doctors\n who said, Kasten earns too much. Could the KBV members change that? The KBV could, because then a contract would be issued, say that's too much or too little.\n The whole has earned less.\n Or more or the same. And in that respect, it's a question of how to agree and whether\n you say, well, we think it's okay or not.\n It's also legitimate if the law enforcement says,\n I think the judge is stupid or he earns too much.\n You can of course formulate that that way.\n But at the end of the day you have to let the court choose\n and say, I'll decide with it.\n I have a few questions about the position of the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung.\n The topic of civil insurance.\n It's a topic in politics again and again."

      "However, those who promised this have shot themselves into their own knees through reports they gave in order.\n Because if you read the reports correctly, it turns out that even if everything goes very well and if they get everything they want,\n economic growth increases by 0.5% within 10 years.\n So the economic performance, not the growth.\n Divide by 10 years, so 0.05%.\n That is below the measureable limit.\n In other words, there is no advantage.\n How many million jobs are there in addition?\n Yes, there was a report here.\n There was talk of millions of additional jobs.\n But these reports are based on more or less fictitious assumptions that will never be presented and will never be proven.\n But that's not important. I understand the idea that unnecessary technical checks are being unified in such a large trading area.\n This must not necessarily be wrong.\n It is important that it takes place publicly, that it is transparent, that it is verifiable\n and that, of course, the last word always has to be in our case at the European Parliament\n and in the American case at the American Congress,\n and not only in a partial way for an agreement\n but also when regulations are agreed upon\n and there has to be a comparison\n so why not\n bring the European drug test to the American level?\n I wouldn't think that's bad\n yes, why not?\n or why not vice versa\n bring the protection of the American consumer from poorly processed food at least to the European level?\n That would be good too.\n You could negotiate in the other direction, then the whole thing would not cause so much anger among the people.\n Speaking of the free trade agreement, could that have any impact on the internet companies?\n Yes, of course.\n How?\n Yes, because it is of is also about data protection standards.\n Of course, it is also about balance. This is also discussed. And we also know that\n there are serious differences between Europe and America. Although, to be honest,\n one has to say that the American companies have so far been less concerned about the difference\n in European data protection law and have more or less\n cool about it and every time they are caught on something, they say oh we are sorry we have\n we have overlooked then we will do it differently in the future but still I say again\n if there were transparent public negotiations between representatives of the American\n state and the European Union\n about how to design the data protection law internationally in the future.\n Yes, I would think that's great. That would be good.\n Then we finally have a transatlantic data protection debate that we don't have yet.\n But we only have one about the media and the Americans always say the stupid Europeans\n and the Europeans say, oh, the Americans don't understand anything at all.\n If the whole thing in the public space should be discussed intensively with the compulsion to agree, there could really be something.\n You just mentioned the EU Parliament and the US Congress.\n They have the last word at the end of the whole thing.\n So assuming this free trade agreement comes, who has to decide?\n Yes, the two parliaments have to sign the agreement.\n Not just the Bundestag?\n No, the Bundestag has agreed to the mandate submission to the American side, the Congress, will say,\n well, nice what you've done, but we wouldn't agree to that.\n It's becoming more and more likely, because there are protests on the American side,\n especially against this issue with the special justice, with the schiedsgericht and because in the american congress as well as\n known in the sub-house in the representative house we have the opponents of\n obama the majority and yes the republicans anyway and have\n therefore also at this point a chance of the government to bring a slap\n whereby you have to say that it tears it then the\n republican party because she is rather if you like the interests to make a mistake, but you have to say that the Republican Party is torn apart\n because it is rather, if you will, the interests of international companies that are inclined to you and represent you.\n And if you then make sure that the trade agreement fails, it will probably be the Republicans who will make a mistake.\n I'm not quite sure how the voting in the Congress will go, but in any way at the initial stage of this whole agreement.\n So that you will definitely look for a new beginning and that it will probably come to an end in this and not in the next year.\n How long does it take to negotiate?",
      "So why not bring the European drug test to the American level?\n I wouldn't think that's bad.\n Yes, why not?\n Or why not, on the other hand, bring the protection of American consumers\n from poorly processed food at least to the European level?\n That would be good too.\n You could also negotiate in the other direction.\n Then the whole thing might not be so much anger with the people.\n then the whole thing might not cause so much anger among the people.\n So, a new episode. Jungen Naiv, we're in Berlin. Where are we?\n At Anhalter Bahnhof.\n Anhalter Bahnhof. And you're an old acquaintance. We've already met.\n Who are you?\n Harald Schumann, my name is. I'm editor at Tagesspiegel.\n And before we start, we're doing crowdfunding right now. we are collecting at least 15,000 euros for our Europe tour. Do you know what crowdfunding is?\n Of course.\n Tell us.\n The authors try to collect money from potential viewers and money to finance their project.\n Exactly, that's how it is.\n We're collecting money, you can support us at Krautreporter,\n until, I think, April 25th, if you have time.\n And Harald, I read that you write articles in this Daily Spiegel\n and you once spoke about a free trade agreement.\n And that was new to me, I've never heard of that.\n What do you talking about?\n The agreement that is currently in the debate\n is a planned agreement between the European Union\n and the USA.\n It is called\n Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership\n or TTIP.\n It is about the European Union and the American government\n negotiating with each other how trade across the Atlantic\n should be further simplified, especially by\n equating technical standards and regulations. Behind that is the interest\n of big companies,\n that they, for example,\n when they bring a new car on the market,\n it doesn't have to be allowed in Europe and then again in the USA.\n Here in Germany it is built with yellow indicators\n and in America with red indicators.\n They would like one approval for the common market,\n but they would save a lot of money.\n So it sounds like a great thing.\n If the corporations want that,\n I've always learned that if the corporations are happy,\n then the country is happy.\n And if it was just about such simple technical simplifications,\n then that would be a good thing.\n Unfortunately, there is a big but,\n because, as always,\n if you give lobbyists\n and lawyers of transnational\n companies the opportunity, then they try\n to put as much as possible in their interest\n in such agreements.\n And that's why they have much more\n in the proposals for this\n agreement, if you will, dictated\n than is necessary. So,\n for example, it is also discussed\n that the respective governments\n on both sides of the Atlantic\n have to open the markets for public orders\n for all public services\n for providers from both regions.\n This would then mean, for example,\n that if public transport has to be written off in German or French cities...\n That means if an S-Bahn is built?\n No, also the operation of the S-Bahn, the operation of buses and so on, that it has to be same as before, that the national states have their complete freedom to organize their health care as they want, or whether it will be compulsory privatization of services and health care.\n If you look at the American side, then of course American medical and hospital companies are pressing for it to come into business here in Europe.\n So far, everything has not yet been finished.\n What is also very problematic, which I find the most difficult in this whole agreement, is that the corporations are pressing for a kind of special justice. So international companies, international investors should get the opportunity to complain to governments and states if they make regulations that reduce their profits.\n What?\n Yes. There is also an example for this. There is a comparable agreement, for example, which is valid within the European Union for Germany and Sweden.\n And that is why the Swedish state-owned company Vattenfall is now suing the Federal Republic of Germany\n before an international trial for compensation of, I think, more than 3 billion euros because of the nuclear exit.\n Because that of course meant for Vattenfall that they had to put two nuclear power plants, with which they would still have a lot of money to earn.\n They won't earn the money now and that's why they're complaining."

    "response": "\nImplementing reforestation projects in Germany and Europe could potentially bring significant economic and environmental benefits. These projects could contribute to achieving climate neutrality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO2, thereby helping mitigate the effects of global warming. Reforestation can also help improve air quality, reduce soil erosion, and enhance water retention. Moreover, increased forest cover can provide habitats for a diverse range of wildlife, supporting biodiversity and promoting ecological balance. Additionally, reforestation can create job opportunities in sectors like forest management, construction, and tourism, while also fostering sustainable development. However, it is crucial to consider the appropriate mix of forest types and locations to maximize these benefits and ensure that reforestation efforts complement existing conservation measures.",
    "contexts": [
      "Now I'm also a fan of growth.\n Can I come to the IFO Institute and say,\n do a study on how we can ensure forest growth, fish growth, biodiversity growth, soil nutrient growth?\n Yes, I don't know if we would do that specifically, but ...\n Now we are back to our way of doing business. Because that is, in addition to the CO2 emissions. Yes, I think these are important questions. For example, forestry is an effective tool against climate change, against climate warming.\n We shouldn't do more forestry, so I would find it very exciting to do a study on it. There are also studies about it that say something.\n I want to know how we can do that. Because currently it is like this, economic growth means a return to fish, a return to species, a return to the forest.\n I want to know how we can achieve forest growth, fish growth.\n Exactly. When we think about forest growth, we have to ask ourselves how we actually use our areas today. And we now have, we use a certain amount for transport areas, for other things. And then you have to ask the question, why can't we,\n if we say today we need 2% of our land area for wind energy, why can't we say,\n okay, we also take 2% for mining. Or 5. Or 5, or whatever. I think\n you don't need that much to become climate neutral.\n You could become climate neutral through the reforestation of a certain part of the land.\n Otherwise you don't need to do anything.\n I find the project exciting.\n I'm not an expert in forestry, but there are studies least look at the environmental consequences. And I think that's an interesting question,\n whether this is not an underestimated option in environmental policy.\n I just wanted to make it more problematic. The problem is always the problem of economic growth and CO2 emissions\n and to get a decoupling there, but that's not the only problem with the climate catastrophe.\n Absolutely right. Yes, well, we already talk a lot about other things.\n Sealing is a huge topic in urban planning, in landscape planning.\n And deforestation is a topic.\n But I also think we should talk more about reforestation in Germany and in Europe.\n What is important then? Variety or economic growth?\n Because currently, over the last 100 years,\n humanity says, economic growth.\n Economic growth is the result\n of decisions by all of us.\n And the return of diversity of species\n in the same way And the problem is, it brings us back to the starting point.\n If we don't do anything about it, don't intervene in a controlled way, then something happens.\n I think the mistake in your argument is to put it against each other.\n So if you put most people before the election, if you ask most people in front of the election, are you willing to give up 20% of your income?\n If that benefits the species diversity, I fear that many people will decide to keep the income.\n That's terrible, but a political That's too high a level.\n I think you have to ask yourself the question, what kind of species protection can we do?\n And maybe what we do will lead to more growth in the economy.\n For example, if we build up a recycling industry for plastic and throw it away,\n then the gross domestic product will increase people are dealing with collecting this plastic. The gross domestic product rises and the species protection improves because certain fish no longer die out and so on.\n That means you need resources for environmental protection.\n I think that to do this against each other leads to the fact that you can't get any further.\n So if you stand up and say you have to be poor so that you can't go on. If you stand up and say, you have to be poor\n so that we can save the earth,\n then most people will say,\n then I don't want to save the earth.\n You have to tell people,\n I'll show you how you can connect prosperity\n and a future for yourself with environmental protection.\n Then you can move on.\n Otherwise most people will decide\n to take care of themselves first.\n The more wealthy your country is, the better it is for the people?\n Overall yes. There are studies to live with it.\n So the GDP per head in a country is...\n No, but it's already the promise of capitalism.\n Basically, if people have more wealth, then their quality of life increases.\n That's what they're being asked.",
      "A few questions that came in beforehand, already in the forum of Jung und Naiv.\n Fundamental question, is it possible to exploit the existential forest commercially in view of climate change and rapidly disappearing species of diversity ethically, That would mean the end of forestry for commercial purposes.\n I think we should think with people as much as possible in harmony with nature.\n And this model that I described earlier, that if we now come from the 3.1% of use-free forests to 10%,\n but we have 30% protected areas and use them carefully and in the remaining area close to nature, which is also careful,\n then we can combine that from my point of view, that we support the biological diversity very, very strongly and at the same time\n also use this natural raw material. But it is actually the case that we need more protection areas\n at many places where species go back very clearly. need more protected areas. That's similar to the fishing policy.\n Yes, well, they say that we, or they know that we have 18% of the forests in protected areas now\n and that we need at least 30% of the forests in protected areas\n so that the biological diversity is supported.\n And I think we should take this seriously so that we can finally counteract this loss of biological diversity.\n Then the fundamental question is also asked.\n Should we forage in the fallen dead forest or not? Which trees should grow in the future? growing with us. Can you continue to answer the deforestation of old trees in beech forests\n for marketing? The coalition agreement says that we want to take the old beech forests out of use\n in the public forest and I think that is a support for the biological diversity and our nature, forest ecosystems,\n first of all a matter of support.\n The question is actually quite different, if I understand it correctly.\n What do we do with the forests that are now damaged?\n And what do we plant there if we want to plant something? The first point is that we should not completely clear these areas,\n because then we really do damage to the ground and also set more plastic free.\n But what about the beaver?\n No, not clearing, for example, the stumps and so on. Okay, I understand. We should leave a structure there and definitely work with natural fertilization.\n Natural fertilization always brings the pioneer trees.\n Pioneer trees are birches, poplars, vines and so on.\n And they lead to the fact that the soil is covered again very quickly and then, for example, no soil erosion\n takes place, the humus does not dissolve into carbon dioxide more and more.\n So, and then the question of the tree species. Yes, I think that has become clear. I am for\n lawn trees for various reasons, just for the waterhouse, for the natural environment, for mixing.\n We have many trees that we have used little,\n we can also use the leaves.\n We should never try to take trees that are dry resistant,\n because dry resistant trees always dry out the system further and thus actually continue the cycle of damage.\n And maybe that too, very briefly as an answer. I think we humans are a bit too linear in our thoughts.\n If we take, for example, a drought resistant tree species resistant, we only optimize for drought.\n But we don't optimize for the wind and the storms that we have in addition, not for the heavy rain.\n And we don't even know what climate it is.\n Climate change is a dynamic process and not a plateau.\n Now we have this climate, we change and have another climate and we adapt to it.\n That's not the way we have in front of us.\n You also speak to forest owners.\n They are asked, have the state and private forest owners actually already understood\n that there will be no more forest like 1960, 1970, not so long ago, will no longer exist.\n Question two, how many of them are already acting and what do they do as a solution?\n I think that's a good question.\n Those are great questions, but I may not have the right answers. That this forest, just like we are losing these fig forests,\n the losses of these damages were 5% of our needlewood.\n That's immense.\n That means that everyone who thinks about it should be clear that it doesn't go on like that. And the one who thinks, well, it's going on again,\n I think it's really just a single individual\n who assumes that it's still going on like that with the fig tree."

    "query": "What did Dieter Nuhr express about the reasons why some people prefer to drive cars instead of using public transport, especially in cities where public transport is a viable alternative?",
    "response": "\nDieter Nuhr believes that one primary reason behind people's preference for driving cars is the personal space and privacy it provides. He mentioned that many individuals find solace in having an hour alone in their cars, listening to their favorite music and engaging in self-reflection. This aspect of driving cars seems to outweigh the potential benefits of public transportation for them. Additionally, he acknowledges the importance of considering the environmental impact of excessive individual car usage and the need for sustainable alternatives.",

      "Well, in my youth, my youth starts with driving license at 18, I have to say, It was like that, that I didn't get ahead in the city either.\n The problem is ancient.\n And that it's actually nobody's interest that you don't get ahead in the city.\n So that's actually stupid.\n But nobody asks why people still get into the car.\n I think that's so strange, too.\n Because I think that has its reason.\n Why does someone get stuck in traffic jam every day for an hour if he could also use public transport?\n I think that's an essential point and I don't think about it too much that people are alone in this car. For many people this is the only hour in their lives they have for themselves,\n in which they can listen to the music they want to hear, as loud as they want, in which they can come to themselves.\n And I think that's a very important reason why many people prefer to drive a car than to use public transport.\n In a city like Berlin, it's something different, where public transport, I don't want to say works, but it's a real alternative.\n Because a lot of people live together very closely.\n But you can also do that with a car that doesn't belong to you. You don't have to own your own.\n That's the problem I learned from our climate scientists in recent years.\n We have too many individual cars that drive 23 hours a day.\n The problem has been known for 40 years. I was never a car freak.\n We still have no solution.\n I never understood this thing when people were screwing people to their car. For many cars, of course, a fetish object. I've never had that. I don't have any fancy cars either. I'm not interested in driving a certain car. No, I don't think so.\n My grandpa, I come from the GDR, after the turn of the century, always had to drive a Mercedes every five years. I think I also got used to looking down from above to underestimate material longing.\n I remember that in 1989, when the wall fell, I was of the opinion that the GDR can't be as bad as the conservatives always are. That was my opinion.\n You didn't know about Stasi?\n Of course we knew about Stasi. But as a leftist, you always play that down while you play the other one up.\n Then in 1989, on November 9th, I drove off to G\u00f6ttingen, towards Duderstadt, because the wall was open and I couldn't believe it. And I went through the city in Duderstadt, which was full of people at 4 p.m.\n at 4 p.m. and saw a key picture of my life. It was a family, father, mother and two children standing hand in hand in front of a Deichmann shoe store and crying. And that was the moment\n when I thought, you better shut up now, you don't understand what these things mean.\n Because we were classic back then, all this material shit, it's all too much, it has to stop.\n And that was an essential point where I learned that these things, these goods that we have presented as a pure fetish character,\n that it simply has a deeper meaning, that you can afford them or not. And that it is a very arrogant attitude to say to someone who can afford the goods,\n that's not all that important.\n But what you criticized was the overconsumption, right?\n Yes.\n And the Aussies have no consumption at all.\n Where does the overconsumption begin? I don't know.\n If we consume so much that it harms our earth.\n Yes.\n When did you go to the earth? Were you ever in front of the earth in the GDR?\n Once in East Berlin in 1982.\n And? Unimaginable. It was so strange for us like a journey to the moon.\n It was beyond any debate that the wall would stand forever.\n We made fun of the people who said the wall must go away.\n We laughed at them because we thought they were crazy.\n As if the wall ever came away.\n One of the main points where I learned that what you think of yourself should never be considered absolute.\n When Reagan called Mr. Gorbachev to tear down this wall, we really thought the man was insane.",
      "A bit like public law, the roundabout or what?\n A bit similar.\n Then of course you could also finance it solidariously and on much wider shoulders.\n But then of course you have to do it with appropriate frequency,\n with the connection of the outside districts, the reasonable ones, with barrier freedom.\n So public transport is the only transport system that everyone can really use and should be able to use without social restrictions.\n That's why you have to make sure that you finance it in a good way and let everyone finance it and also expand it and open up to people with mobility disabilities via barrier freedom.\n But the first step there, and that's what I want in the short term,\n is, for example, the social ticket for people who get a basic insurance.\n That the monthly social ticket costs as much as they actually get in the Hartz IV set.\n That's 25 euros and not 37.\n And what I want is that the current increases in driving prices,\n which happen annually, there is such an automatism that the driving prices in Berlin increase annually,\n that this will be ended and that we will move in the opposite direction.\n But we need investments in the near-distance transport.\n We also have to promote roadway expansion.\n Roadways are cheap, roadways are electromobility, roadways can be built relatively quickly and operated well.\n It is a competitively cheap means of transport.\n If only we had saved these chancellor-urban, which nobody really needs.\n I like to drive them.\n Yes, I wonder if you like to drive them or something.\n I need them.\n For what?\n To get to the end.\n From where to where?\n There are for everything. From A to B. Yes, what? To get to Kin. From where to where? There are all kinds of routes.\n From A to B.\n Yes, what is A to B?\n Let's assume, for example, you take Alexanderplatz as the entry point and the main station as the planned end point.\n Then the S-Bahn will drive there.\n Exactly the same route.\n It will drive there.\n Maybe I have a phobia of the S-Bahn and I like to drive the U-Bahn.\n Good.\n Then you have a problem, of course.\n If you have phobias of individual means of transport you have a, oh, that's a special restriction.\n A minority you want to protect, right?\n Well, the question of which minorities and what are human rights-related concerns and what are not, is an exciting question.\n But no, she likes it, you like her, it's nice, but she's not quite finished yet, but it will be at some point. I would have preferred, we have a difference now, if we had used the same money to build 200 km of tram tracks here.\n We would have been able to secure a very large connection of many, so far, off-road trains in our city with the same money.\n I just think that's invested a lot.\n You want to expand the network, tram network. Yes, we have to.\n We have a completely different problem.\n Just because of the increase in individual traffic in the city,\n public transport is becoming slower.\n The buses are getting slower because they are often in traffic jams.\n The tramways are stuck somewhere and can't go on.\n That would also be an important point to talk about,\n how pedestrians, cyclists, individual motorized traffic, public transport, the space in the city is limited.\n And that is of course a question of discussion, what should have what advantage at which point. Bus lane introduction was an incredible debate in the 80s and 90s in our city. Pre-routes for the streetways were a huge debate. Can you do that?\n Do you have to do that?\n Is everything unspoken today that it makes sense?\n And we have to keep going.\n Because the fact alone that fossil fuels are getting more expensive, getting smaller,\n that they are an environmental pollution, that the space in the city is limited and\n electromobility can only be achieved by very, very wealthy people in the long run, forces\n us to think about alternatives.\n That's why public transport is a very important issue,\n just like cycle paths and of course the space for the normal, walking down the street.\n Two more small topics. How about drugs?\n I'm in favor of the decriminalization of drugs.\n What about legalization?\n Decriminalization is in fact legalization.\n I call it decriminalization because one thing is important to me."

Yes, you are both Israelis.\n However, Tome is a Jewish Israeli and you, Alina, are a Palestinian Israeli citizen.\n We often experience this in public discussion at the moment, so really as completely contrary, either Palestinian or Jewish-Israeli.\n How do you experience this and you are both, you are Palestinian from the\n origin and you are Jewish citizen.\n What?\n A Jewish citizen?\n Sorry, Israeli citizen, yes.\n That's complicated.\n Israeli citizen.\n Does that bring you into any inner difficulties or do you have a very clear position in terms of the conflict?\n Yes, I have to answer pathetically right now, because I define myself primarily as a human being. but that has no influence, neither my passport nor the birthplace of my father, on how I view the world.\n That certainly influenced me, but that is not the value, that is not decisive for me, so to speak.\n The only influence that this has now concretely for me is that I just know people on all sides of the walls and fences.\n Because my family lives in Israel.\n I'm in contact with them all the time and watch how things are going.\n I ask myself what will happen to them, depending on how the situation will develop.\n At the same time, I have a lot of friends in Gaza and in the West Jordan country.\n That's not true, I don't have many friends in Gaza.\n I have some good friends in Gaza, a lot of friends in the West Jordan country.\n And I know the Palestinian perspective very well,\n because that's also the perspective that I try to bring into the German discourse, if you can even speak of a discourse.\n I wake up in the morning and see if my good friend still lives in Gaza, I talk to my family in Haifa, we come from the same city, and see what happened last night with my friends in the West Jordan country.\n How are you?\n Not really. I am ...\n Well, people always ask how your family is doing.\n I just wanted to know how you are doing.\n Yes, but that's of course connected.

And, yeah, it's like before.\n Compared to before October 7th,\n I think everything has changed a little.\n Not a little, everything has changed.\n In the sense that... The conversation in many ways is very, very limited, very restricted.\n And many things that I said publicly before without any problems, I can't say without any problems.\n For example?\n Trick question.\n Wait, you mean in Germany now?\n In Germany, but also in general.\n Even when I talk to my family in Israel, because it is wartime in Israel and the propaganda is so strong that I'm losing friends in Israel.\n Really.\n People who before October 7th were on the same political side and suddenly not anymore.\n And suddenly they are speaking from a lot of emotions,\n which I can understand, and I am also very emotional.\n But maybe the distance makes it for me\n that I can think a little bit rationally.\n And that's why, not just friends, but also family,\n with whom I can't talk or can't talk anymore.\n Exactly.\n I mean, we experience the phenomenon,\n we have, that's maybe a very peculiar leap, leap apparently, but crisis times often lead to social bonds, so to speak, dissolving.",

No, that's not an option.\n But you asked first about antifascism and why a climate movement has to be antifascist and antiracist.\n That's a bit related to history, to colonialism. colonialism together and that the resources the fossil resources that heat up our climate\n in which we heat them and thus also our future that the exploitation\n conditions from the global south come that they come together with corresponding environmental\n conditions corresponding social consequences and finally\n then also with the consequences of the climate change, the strongest, so meanwhile it comes\n here too, the climate change in Germany, but the strongest they meet the global south\n and then it is so if we simply make it concrete an Ethiopian family. A typical family eat as small farmers, have a small field, have children and then\n comes the milk that simply destroys the livestock from Europe and then comes the climate change.\n That means you have heavy rain and you have drought in the change.\n And the drought makes the earth dry out and the heavy rain then washes away the fertile crop, so to speak.\n And the family loses their livelihood.\n And then I should hurt him if he, for economic reasons, because it's about surviving, I want to find a good life somewhere else.\n And then I want to say as a European, hey, you're not coming in here because you're so-called economic refugees.\n They flee because of this lifestyle.\n And that's why it basically has to do with anti-racism\n and anti-fascism.\n Because this ideology\n that says we have a right to be here,\n we have a right to live at the expense of the global sense,\n I question it fundamentally.\n But what is more important in the end?\n That we take a democratic approach?\n Because we decide real climate protection too late in parliamentary majority or then\n maybe set up an eco-dictatorship for 20 years? So that we can do it all just like\n science wants to do it? I said I want a society that unite social freedom and equality.\n With a dictatorship it won't work.\n I have to create social movements, social majorities to do that.\n We have a social majority for more climate protection.\n But no climate action.\n Exactly. But that is the fundamental problem. But as I said, the AfD and Pegida have driven this government forward for a while in migration politics.\n They have implemented many demands.

First of all, because you can argue about legal issues.\n There are often many opinions about this.\n And ultimately the German Federal Constitutional Court decides.\n And the EGH decides the guidelines for the storage of data.\n The EGH is something like the Federal Constitutional Court for German laws,\n the European Court of Justice is something like that for European guidelines.\n Okay, and how should it continue?\n Well, as it looks, the EGH will lift this data storage guideline in parts.\n At least that's what it says in the negotiations.\n That means thumbs down to the stock market?\n Thumbs down, at least as it is now, to the stock market data storage.\n And as I said, individual member states can also have EU law.\n You can have a contract violation procedure and then the EU says,\n wait a minute, you don't follow our regulations.\n And then we are then sued accordingly and then the member state has to pay relatively high fines.\n That can be several million euros a day until they comply with the law again.\n So the current rule says that the\n supply and storage must be there. The Germans say, we can't do that right now.\n And it can happen that the EGH says, supply and storage is stupid, but our government still says, now we will do it.\n Is that possible?\n That is complicated. The EGH will probably not say that data storage is completely stupid, but the EGH will probably say that the guideline is not at all.\n And then we will see how the German government and the majority of the government in the Bundestag behave.\n How will you behave? Do you already have a position?\n Yes, for us it's easy. We reject the data collection, because it just does as if everyone was criminal from the beginning.\n Why? Explain that to me.\n Well, it's not like that either, that we assume that all the people who walk around here are thieves.\n Could be. Do we know that?\n You don't know that?\n That is also the principle of the rule of law, that we assume that the citizens first act in a lawful manner\n and that they do not intervene as citizens without any initial suspicion.\n I have learned now through IDATI that our rule of law can speculate, we can do things on speculation.\n Why can't we speculate on the population? Why can't we speculate on suspicion in general?\n No, that's the difference. You have to distinguish between suspicion of the beginning and,\n in the case of the stock data collection, everyone is declared suspicious without suspicion of the beginning.\n Yes, at some point they will do something.\n Yes, but that is the opposite of a rule of law.\n Why?\n Because the core of a rule of law is that I do not assume from the beginning that it is a criminal, we will now investigate that.\n And what does the big coalition want? What does the SPD, CDU and CSU want?"

    "response": "\nThe Israeli leadership's goal in the ongoing conflict in Gaza seems to be focused on maintaining security and ensuring their own safety. However, it's essential to note that the situation is complex and opinions vary among different groups. As for the proposed plan for Hamas after its defeat, it's uncertain due to the fluid nature of the conflict and the potential emergence of new factions or organizations.",
    "contexts": [
      "And apparently the radical position is rewarded much more than the moderate one.\n Because Israel negotiates with Hamas over a weapon peace.\n And here in Ramallah there are no conversations that in any way include a promotion of this leadership.\n I didn't want to suggest that the Hamas is not a terrorist organization, but I don't think that all Hamas members are terrorists.\n Because they also have, as you already said, other responsibilities.\n And of course they have an anti-Semitic character.\n Well, I don't have any responsibility here at all.\n The main responsibility of the Hamas is clearly in Gaza Strip. They don't dare to more responsibility here. The main area of responsibility is the Gaza Strip.\n They don't dare to cover themselves for different reasons.\n But it remains a complex topic.\n Before we have to make a conclusion, I wanted to mention the German position.\n You hear it all the time.\n Sure, when settlements are built or expanded, the federal government remembers that it is against the law.\n But then there is a statement and nothing else comes. If other states in the world, neighboring countries,\n Europe, Russia and so on break the law of the people, consequences follow. Do you think it is right\n that Israeli violations of the law of the people do not follow consequences?\n Well, the consequences follow, yes, but I don't think they are public.\n It's about keeping certain things in the open.\n I think that the German position and strength is that it uses its confidential conversations in the background to point out certain discontent.\n And I think that makes the federal government very effective and very good.\n And I think that we would rather risk our role in negotiations,\n the role that we take on both sides, here in the ...\n To push for the retention of the civil rights?\n But that ... I'm not speaking for the federal government, because I'm an independent actor here.\n But I want to understand it.\n I think that this is always referred to this civil rights position.\n But I think ultimately it is not only about argumentation in civil rights,\n but also to draw political conclusions from it.\n And these political conclusions mean another settlement more and\n at some point this time window for the two-state solution.\n Why are the civil rights violations\n not punished for over 50 years?\n Why are there\n no consequences?\n We always\n point to it, but\n there are no consequences.\n That's a problem.\n The Israelis can always say, yes, nice that you point out that there are no consequences, but let's move on.\n It's a huge problem.\n I observe it here too.\n I see it the same way.\n I see, because of my long-term stay, which I could observe again and again,\n how exactly the two state-owned solutions will fail in this settlement expansion.\n And that's why I think it's all the more important to point out dramatically\n that precisely because of the missing consequences,\n the two state solutions are becoming increasingly difficult to realize.\n Do you understand why the federal government, for example,\n always addresses the settlement expansion and the right to population rights,\n but when it comes to the occupation as such, which is also against the law, why doesn't that come into question at all?\n No, that's not true. The occupation is called that way. All official positions and what is being voiced and what is being published clearly states that we have to do with an occupation, that's also true in East Jerusalem, and that an effective blockade will be held over the Gaza Strip.\n This unrighteous regime,\n that's clearly being called that.\n That would surprise me.\n I've been following this for a few years in a press conference,\n for example, exactly how it is talked about.\n It is mostly spoken of occupied areas.\n The Federal Government never speaks\n the word occupation in the mouth.\n Did you notice that?\n So I go through the official documents and there I see exactly what is ultimately also in accordance with the law of the people, what is to be observed here.\n Does the German government recognize that Israel is responsible for the Gaza Strip?\n Yes, simply because effective control will be maintained further.\n In this respect, it is clear that Israel has a responsibility to take responsibility.\n But you don't see that there are Palestinian homework.\n Which ones?\n That goes in the direction of reconciliation.\n That means that Hamas and Fatah must find reconciliation\n so that an inner democratic process is started with elections.\n When could they come?\n I don't know.\n Last question. Does Abbas say,\n make some elections?",
      "That's another point. But from my experience in the West Jordan country, I have worked a lot with international institutions and German institutions and so on on site.\n So no one who seriously lives and works in the West Jordan country still believes in the two-state solution.\n So really nobody. And even more absurd that it is still propagated while we are still moving away from it.\n We have been dealing with this conflict for 8-9 years. On both sides there were voices who said the same thing as we did. there can be no security for Israel without a security for Palestinians.\n And it doesn't exist without, and that's the fundamental point, without an end to the occupation.\n So the dominance of one side over the other.\n The oppression of the Palestinians for decades. Would you agree with that? Yes, definitely. I think there are many empty sentences that are said these days.\n For example, the security of Israel or Israel's right to self-defense, whatever it means, because it can actually mean a lot.\n For example, what Israel is doing in Gaza right now,\n is often explained by Israel's self-defense law in Germany.\n The question is whether this really brings defense,\n whether this will really bring security to the Israelis.\n And after so many similar, to a lesser extent, but similar bombings on Gaza in the last decades,\n which had led to nothing, after Hamas was only stronger,\n you really have to ask yourself,\n does it make sense?\n So, is it...\n Isn't it more emotional, what's happening right now, and not...\n Yeah, so... I'm not sure what's happening emotionally. I'm very desperate that Hamas will be destroyed by this attack.\n If Hamas is destroyed, I won't be surprised if something more radical comes to the city of Hamas.\n We have also seen this with Al-Qaeda and IS and that makes sense in the end. I don't know how the bombarded children of Gaza feel about Israel.\n I can only speculate that there is no great love there.\n Can you tell us something?\n How the bombarded children of Gaza feel?\n You know people in Gaza.\n Well, um...\n In no logic in this world, really,\n can any person explain to me\n how...\n killing, I don't know, 10,000 people in 4 weeks, over 3,000 children,\n should bring safety for someone.\n That makes no sense in the logic of this world.\n Of course, that will bring any security. It will only bring misfortune, pain, trauma for the next hundreds of years.\n Hate, frustration, anger, grief, pain.\n That's the only thing that's being created right now.\n And we see that in Israel, by the way. There were many international lefts, I would say,\n who celebrated the 7th of October as liberation or decolonization.\n And then I think to myself, no liberation can look like this. No real liberation can be achieved through murder and kidnapping. that she is a land, feminine in Hebrew, that Gaza is being bombed.\n I agree with that completely.\n I just think there are many points since October 7th, where we can understand each other, because the experience reflects and reflects again\n and still it is not done. That's one of them. Or for example, but okay, I go a little\n associatively in another direction. We don't want to talk about the German debate and the German perspective all the time,\n but also about the local and maybe a peace perspective, as naive as that may be.\n But I would like to briefly, because the word has already been mentioned a few times,\n and I would like to see your two perspectives on it.\n Robert Habeck confirmed the week, Angela Merkel introduced it in 2008 in the Knesset into the German-Israeli-Palestinian debate.\n What do you think about this term and what it stands for and what it isn't? I already briefly talked about it at the beginning.\n It is state reason, because of the historical responsibility of Germany towards Jews.\n However, Jews are a very diverse group, also politically.\n And this historical responsibility on a national state, a political project,\n which is in the end a political project of a movement within the Jewish world, namely Zionism.\n I don't know if I would consider the historical responsibility us, there are many who are not so much\n in this debate,\n what Zionism means,\n or rather anti-Zionism."

He believes that the medical use of cannabis should be handled under medical supervision, ensuring proper prescription and control.

But we still still have a lot of people with the question of criminalization,\n that we still have a stigma on the issue of cannabis consumption.\n That it is actually no longer adequate how we deal with this topic.\n That it no longer actually fulfills the expectations that one should actually have\n to a modern drug policy. What are should have of a modern drug policy.\n What are the expectations of a modern drug policy?\n For me, it was important to make clear through the position paper that it is necessary,\n we need a new approach, we need a regulated approach.\n We have a wide black market in Germany in the area of cannabis.\n It's flourishing, it's growing, it's there.\n You can't discuss it away, we just close our eyes to these conditions,\n that so many people in Germany consume cannabis regularly.\n If you look at the year, it's every tenth, 8.8% of adults in Germany\n consume cannabis on average once a year.\n These are numbers you cannot be wiped aside\n according to the motto that cannabis is forbidden.\n So it doesn't exist that cannabis is consumed in Germany.\n That's why you have to find an answer for it, how regulated it is.\n That was my answer. We need a regulated market\n to ultimately ensure health care there\n and that people don't have to worry about the black market.\n Is it the third most popular drug in Germany?\n I can imagine that smoking and alcohol will probably be even more popular.\n I'm not going to make lists about whether you can read that in terms of quantity.\n But it will be one of the most common drugs in Germany? Don't you have a ranking of the most popular drugs in Germany?\n I don't have a list where I could list them.\n But it's based on alcohol and tobacco being number one and number two, right?\n Alcohol and tobacco are the in society and leads to many problems.\n We can still bring 110.000 deaths from alcohol and tobacco to the\n world. It is much more important to be aware of it than to ask how we deal with cannabis in Germany.\n Now we have raised the topic and we are dealing with it.\n Why is alcohol not allowed and cannabis not?\n That's not the central question you have to ask yourself. Why it is allowed and\n the other is not allowed, but the question is how do we regulate it?\n Is one a drug or the other a drug? Why is one a forbidden drug?\n That's the crucial question, Andy. How do we regulate the handling of the drug alcohol?\n How do we regulate the handling of the and alcohol? How do we regulate the treatment of drugs and cannabis?\n And if both are very contradictory in Germany at the moment, then one should name them and actually go ahead and show the possibilities.\n How do you get that back into a debate where you can understand why one thing, which we currently have as a massive problem, the massive consumption of alcohol, which is a massive problem,\n and on the other hand we talk about a problem, but I don't think it's acceptable under certain conditions.\n But how can we explain this contradiction?\n That alcohol, the most dangerous drug of all, is allowed and cannabis is not.\n You will probably have to look back in history and read a lot of newspapers\n why it developed like this and why the other one developed like this.\n You will probably have spoken to people who are against the legalization of cannabis.\n You will ask them why they are for legal alcohol.\n I am asked in the regularity, how do you want to deal with cannabis?\n What are your ideas so that we can deal with this problem we have with cannabis consumption in Germany,\n that it is consumed in mass black, or that many people have problems with it if they consume it,\n and with criminal proceedings that are still in effect there.",
      "This is not directly part of the topic of drug and addiction,\n but it is also about cannabis.\n It is a medical issue that is being evaluated at the moment.\n But you have the expertise.\n At that point, it is necessary and important that we actually created this possibility back then.\n I think that's the right way.\n I would also imagine and could imagine that we would lead this debate about the ability to treat,\n about the best treatment possibility again.\n We are missing some studies in Germany that we we have to initiate. Yes, but the medical or cannabis as a drug for medical use,\n the effect is not controversial.\n And when you say opiate, painkillers are provided,\n and here, too, with cannabis, if it is medically administered, there is a benefit.\n It would only be logical that the banks would take over that.\n The banks take over when it is approved,\n it is proven that there is a benefit.\n Not every treatment method has a benefit and can be proven.\n And the study situation is extremely small in this regard.\n I used myself for this, among other things,\n that we shouldn't prescribe opiates too easily in Germany,\n but they also have their rights in some therapies.\n And this possibility, what we use in the therapies,\n what helps and what doesn't,\n a doctor has to decide about that.\n That's the essential thing.\n I don't want self-medication,\n even if it's about cannabis.\n That's the point of contact\n where many people now write me down.\n When we talk about the question\n of regulation of cannabis,\n I want us to stay in the medical cannabis,\n as far as possible in the medical field.\n That is necessary and right,\n so that it can also happen under medical supervision\n when it comes to therapy.\n And I think it's good\n if we really have relief\n in the possibility of prescription.\n Then the circle is covered again.\n What do you think\n of the possibilities of consumption\n in the local coffee shops?\n For example.\n I would like to say, as far as consumption is concerned,\n no consumption analogous to what we often had in the past,\n for example with tobacco.\n That means a strong restriction,\n also as far as the public sector is concerned.\n Coffee shops, if it is a public sector,\n I would not place them as a consumer location.\n But?\n If it's a public area, no. If coffee shops are a cannabis club, for example fungi, which, this is the thesis, are far less dangerous than cannabis?\n There are actually two questions behind it. The question is how open we are in research, where it is actually also about studying with other psychedelic substances or with other psychotropic substances.\n From my point of view, we really have to do even more.\n The other question, what is more dangerous or not, I cannot answer,\n because it often has to do with my own feeling.\n What I am using is this question, we need more health competence\n in the entire population, which affects the effect of needing more health skills in the general population,\n as far as the effect of psychoactive substances is concerned.\n Also the question of what are the reasons for my consumption,\n why I drink too much coffee, why I drink too much alcohol,\n or why I smoke too much cannabis or take other substances.\n People should also become aware of this and we need more knowledge,\n more information, more advice, but also the one that is part of it.\n Yes, but it's also about practices.\n There was a question, what do you think of an LSD driver's license,\n that young people could also consume LSD in professional-qualified support?\n I cannot imagine LSD consumption in young people.\n And that's why we should...\n I cannot imagine that one would issue driver's licenses about it,\n if it is about young teenagers at this point.\n Teenagers or even almost children.\n What does the federal government want to do about the fact that 13-year-olds are now running around with e-cigarettes?\n That's a development that is really worrisome, which has developed as a hype in the last months.\n I think it's not okay to consume e-cigarettes at the moment.\n The single-use e-cigarettes are not to be found in the hands of children and adolescents.\n They are also forbidden.\n Under 18-year-olds are not allowed to sell them.\n That's why it has to be more respected.\n What do you think of the Portuguese model? That's why it has to be more or other drugs. In Portugal it is always connected, if one becomes noticeable, with advice,\n also therapy and with conversations that are part of it, possibly interventions."

And the court, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, is a kind of semi-secret special court, where Amnesty was not allowed to be present at all sessions that concerned it.\n What?\n Yes, state secrets, national security threats and so on.\n And that found out, yes, it was not so good to monitor Amnesty and other organizations.\n First they found out, the secret service said they had not monitored Amnesty.\n It turned out they had confused Amnesty with another, I think, Egyptian organization that also starts with an A.\n Then they adjusted and said, yes, there was an surveillance of Amnesty International.\n It wasn't fair, but only because the data was stored too long after the evaluation.\n That means they have to be stored less long, then they can continue to monitor you.\n But only in the UK, not in Germany?\n Or can the UK Foreign Secret Service keep an eye on you now?\n Well, it's certainly something they don't want officially.\n We were together in the European Union until recently.\n But even the BND has people from the European Union and institutions of the European Union, they say, for the NSA,\n because they no longer had the diversity of the selectors, these are search terms that the NSA then handed over to the BND as a partner.\n That is also the problem with such a mass surveillance instead of a more targeted approach, that you work with so many search terms and data amounts that you might even know that you don't want to monitor a certain institution or something, and you just run away.\n Could you be sure that it is not monitored here in Germany?\n By the constitutional protection or the\u2026\n By foreign secret services, through German secret services? We actually have a complaint from the Federal Constitutional Court against the G10 law.\n And say that because of the legal situation now, we cannot rule out that if we communicate internationally across the border, then it is no longer just German communication traffic that we will be affected.\n But you don't know if you are currently being monitored or not being monitored?\n We don't get any notifications that we have been monitored.\n You have already mentioned the G10 law twice. What is that?\n That is the law that regulates the restriction of Article 10 of the Basic Law and that is the post and email. And we have already talked about the fact that the privacy in this room,\n which also includes communication, the confidentiality of communication,\n is basically a right that can be restricted.\n Where we also say, yes, this can be possible under certain circumstances,\n but it has to happen proportionally.\n There is also a G10 Commission, what does it do?\n Yes, the G10 Commission is responsible for having control over and authorizing communication that is monitored under Article 10.\n But here we have the following somewhat curious situation. the public was not aware that the BND and the federal government are of the opinion that the so-called\n foreign communication, i.e. if someone from Pakistan is on the phone with someone in the USA, for example,\n that they are not protected by Article 10 Basic Law and that they do not have to send it to the G10 Commission,\n which de facto meant that it took place in a free space.\n which in fact meant that it took place in a free space. They have now adjusted it by creating a new body, the so-called independent control body,\n which is now responsible for this communication.\n Are you satisfied?\n I think it's better than if it didn't exist, better than the status quo,\n that the foreign communication took place in a right-wing space.\n But it also contributes to a fragmentation that we already have with the news service control.\n So it's a patchwork. When there are different organs, then it can always be that someone thinks the other is responsible.\n Or small children also go to the parents when they weren't allowed to do something with their mother.",

Then it would be good if, similar to a court case,\n and the Federal Constitutional Court also said that the control of the news services should\n actually be court-like, if there was someone there, so to speak, the lawyer of the affected.\n But if, I don't know, the BND has a good reason to monitor a terrorist,\n then should the terrorist know about the lawyer beforehand.\n Exactly, that's not how it works.\n You would have one person who represents the perspective of the person affected by the surveillance.\n That doesn't mean that you have to inform the affected person in advance.\n You should inform them in the aftermath if possible,\n so that a right-wing approach is possible against, if not unjustified surveillance.\n Does the GC-Commission say, we can talk about it later, who is a member, but do they always say yes?\n No.\n So do they always say, oh, BND has something, oh, a good reason.\n They say, they already know sometimes no, but they have, I think they say they have a majority yes\n and they haven't received many applications in the past.\n So the entire foreign surveillance.\n Only a fraction of the surveillance measures have ended up with the Gizim Commission.\n We'll see how that will be in the future.\n Is that percentage? Can you figure that out?\n I can't figure that out right now.\n But I would guess that it's in the percentage range.\n Who is a member?\n The G10 commission? I bet you know that, you must have it written there.\n I don't know who is a member of the G10 commission right now.\n Maybe not a name, but are they politicians, politicians, members of the Bundestag?\n That's a mix of experts. The members of the Bundestag are also in the G10 Commission.\n I have a little blackout regarding the G10 Commission. We have always focused on the content, the control committee.\n No problem. Can Hans tell us when the audience questions come from you?\n You're welcome.\n You can ask Lena anything.\n And then Amnesty 2014 has founded a department in the field of digitalization, surveillance and human rights.\n Exactly, that's when we started to build it up. There are roughly three areas of work.\n One was that after the Snowden-reveal we realized that more and more governments are switching from targeted surveillance to mass surveillance.\n The other was that we noticed, especially as a reaction to the Arab Spring, that many of our amnesty cases,\n i.e. opposition human rights advocates worldwide, were affected by targeted surveillance.\n So that, for example, their smartphones or computers are hacked specifically.\n Often with technology that was exported from Europe.\n And the third is what you, where now not governments,\n but companies were the main drivers and governments\n have missed to regulate and catch companies in time.\n Namely what Shoshana Soubh named surveillance capitalism.\n So this rise in very, very large internet platforms,\n which have now suppressed the most powerful oil companies and have become gatekeepers for our freedom of opinion online."

That came later.\n So that's why I understand, disinterest is a general hegemonic feature of Western culture that did not have to deal with the new one to that extent.\n The old one simply continued in the West.\n That sounds very logical, but it doesn't.\n In the data we actually found exactly the opposite.\n We have seen that the perception of the deprived situation\n towards Muslims in the West is very high.\n So very high, yes.\n I didn't just mean Muslims, it's interesting that you always bring it to Muslims.\n But I think that's your experience, you have other experiences that go beyond the studies.",
      "Your statement alone, the East does not exist,\n is a mantra, so to speak. Muslims don't exist.\n So, in other words, to show that there is a hermetic image about a group,\n which of course doesn't reflect the group,\n because it is very different.\n And also to come out of this need\n and to show that it doesn't correspond to my life world or my reality of life.\n However, I can now also say with regard to this research on integration requirements\n or with regard to the research on anti-Muslim racism, I have to say that it is very important to take on this role model position,\n but it does not bring the effect that you wish for or your group wishes for.\n That is the dramatic realization of it now, because in the end it will grow from it,\n that is what I just wanted to say, stereotypes have a function in societies.\n And if you come and show and show the pictures of successful Muslims, successful migrants, successful East Germans,\n it is always only read as an exception that confirms the rule.\n Oh, you're from the East, you can't hear that.\n And you're so international, you did that, congratulations.\n How did you just do that? So these are things that of course hear migrants on the running and are very often\n like model, look here, she did it, he did it, successful integration.\n But it is important for your own peer group, in turn, to be seen by your own\n people as someone who is all about everything,\n has a function, but to consider the function, that changes the stereotype.\n I don't think that does it, because the stereotype has a different function.\n So first of all, with our initiative, it is not that we only want to show particularly successful people.\n On the contrary, our concern is to show the most representative,\n the most representative, which we will probably never be completely,\n but really to show a differentiated picture. And what I notice is that you\n already draw this line in your approach, from the beginning.\n But now there is research that says, okay, if we cluster society differently,\n namely with regard to value settings, then we don't see these differences that much.\n And that's what Maureen Cummins did. And that's why I don't know if that's the right approach,\n to say from the beginning that there are these differences.\n And did you ask the West Germans, for example, whether they feel second class?\n So we have in this study reflected almost all questions again on West Germans.\n But I want to go back to that.\n It doesn't matter at all to show people that it exists there and it exists here. That's a good irritation, but what exists is not a real picture that we're talking about.\n The power of these pictures leads to groups forming,\n leads to new identities crystallizing.\n This idea that you just mentioned, I didn't feel like an East German before,\n but because of the strong negative discourse, the resistance and the positioning awoke in me at some point.\n We can document this in series with Muslims after September 11th.\n For many, their religiosity didn't play a role at all, not even in their self-representation. But the very strong anti-Muslim debates have created a moment of, that's not the group that is described here,\n it does not correspond to my reality of life. I have to oppose something\n in opposition to that. And that's a bit of a narrative. Hannah Arendt once said,\n if you are attacked as a Jew, you have to put yourself in the defense as a Jew. It doesn't matter\n whether you describe yourself as one.\n The picture is in society and this picture leads to a performance.\n That's a theory by Judith Wattler.\n You perform on the calls that are given to you in society.\n And let it be just by saying that the calls are not right.\n But you don't destabilize the pictures yet.\n So you say that what we do has no added value in the end?\n Yes, yes, yes. Especially for the own peer group it has a great added value.\n And of course, the idea of going beyond something as hope.\n I just think the basis of the stereotype is that certain people want to hold this position in certain privileged positions.\n And this position is held by pushing the others into a devalued position and also harming them there.\n And if the individual figures from this lower assigned role lie out and say, but we are not like that at all, then they might be integrated.\n But still, this underlining of society is there to secure certain power privileges."

Of course not.\n Give me a prohibition that still needs it.\n For example, we have a prohibition of FCKW emissions.

Lars, thank you very much for your time.\n Please come back again.\n I'd love to.\n Maybe in another round, a big round.\n We want to continue after the pandemic.\n It's currently a bit difficult.\n And now I'm curious what the audience wanted to know.\n Hans.\n With pleasure.\n So, because many always mock and wonder about it,\n what does he come up with with his notes?\n Dear people, there are situations where handwritten on paper is simply the most efficient form of information storage and communication.\n So that was a pretty broad mixture of questions about subjects and questions about details. One question was asked several times, you already mentioned it, is economics for you actually science, natural science or social science?\n You have already indicated that you do not see it as natural science.\n No, of course. In my opinion, the economy is a science, that is important, that is also questioned by some.\n We work scientifically, with the idea, as we have it in critical rationalism, that we develop theories.\n They don't have to be mathematical, they are just arguments, sentences, as Karl Popper wrote,\n which you set up and make empirically verifiable.\n And then also empirically verifies.\n And that's exactly how we work in economics.\n In this respect, we are a science, but it is a social science.\n That means we take care of ourselves by taking care of economic issues,\n partly beyond that, political or social,\n about the social.\n That is the object we are analyzing.\n And social sciences are also different from natural sciences,\n because we can build to a lesser extent,\n as it is statistically called, on the law of the large number.\n This means, there was a follow-up question,\n if it is social science,\n doesn't economics automatically have parts of ideology.\n And ideology is not used as a negative term, but as ideas and thought structures that are based on this scientific knowledge and their methods.\n Ideas and thought structures always the brain, we know that.",
      "They had a shortlist with me and Clemens Fuest and the minister then decided for me.\n And then I was asked in September, are you fundamentally ready to go to the board of directors?\n And in December there was already green light and in January it went into the press.\n The minister was Rainer Br\u00fcderle?\n Rainer Br\u00fcderle, yes.\n Did he do a good job?\n At some points yes, at some points no.\n I thought he did a good job in the financial crisis, when he asked for the help for Opel.\n In that respect he did a good job. At other points you can be more critical.\n Could you question our economic ways?\n The Council of Representatives has all the possibilities to tackle economic and political issues.\n So you could also say that our current economic system leads to a climate catastrophe, we have to change our economic ways fundamentally.\n The Council of Representatives could do that.\n But you didn't do it.\n No, for good reasons.\n Because the climate crisis is not there.\n Not only because the climate crisis is not there, but because we can also defend it with instruments\n that are very effective for climate protection and, secondly, are well anchored in the market economy.\n That's it.\n So ...\n Yes, that's the key point.\n Climate protection with market economy, although the market economy or capitalism has brought us into this situation.\n Climate protection with market economy is possible, of course.\n I mean, a market economic instrument is the CO2 price and it is highly effective.\n So why should you change this basic principle?\n Of course, the board of trustees is bound by its mandate.\n And in the law of the board of trustees, which determines the mandate, it says that it has developed its analyses and different possibilities for economic policy on the basis based on market economic order.\n So, overthrowing the market economic order,\n that would be difficult for the Council of Representatives to agree with the mandate.\n You could say, people, you have to change that.\n Yes, always change.\n Of course you can change something.\n A higher CO2 pricing means changing something.\n We're talking about decent prices, not the small stuff.\n Do the members of the economic community have to be independent? Are you independent?\n What do you mean independent and value-free? That's a long discussion.\n If we go back to Max Weber, the idealy, you have to say that every person, including every economist who comes to the Council of Comprehension, has their own values and is not free of them.\n You can't be, you're not schizophrenic.\n What, however, and this has been developed very nicely by Karl Popper, which ultimately leads to the freedom of the science, not the individual scientist.\n That is the competition among the scientists.\n And in this respect it is important that very different people from different areas come together in the board of directors.\n And that's what they tried to solve from the beginning, that you ask one member of the union, is that someone you can live with?\n And in the other direction, namely the economic associations, the employers, is that someone you can live with?\n These are the two tickets that have a certain association orientation.\n I formulate this very carefully, because there formal right to suggest anything on both sides. It has simply been established that in normal times, at least in the early stages,\n when it comes to finding someone for the board of directors,\n you also connect with the unions or the employers' associations and then try to find out if that's okay.\n On which ticket are you? and then try to find out if it's okay. What's your ticket? I'm on the ticket of a financial scientist, because since 1974 there's always been a financial scientist in it.\n So someone who knows about public finances and it's obvious that someone does that.\n But do you support the employer side or the union?\n The unions would say today, because I was appointed by the labor commission as a scientist, that I am close to employers.\n But I'm not close to employers and also not close to the trade union.\n You are close to the CDU. You are the chairman of the scientific committee of the CDU-Economical Council.\n The CDU-Economical Council is a construct in which many people are involved who have nothing to do with the CDU.\n But you explicitly discuss the CDU with them."

      "You may remember, at the beginning of his term he said,\n it will not happen.\n And what he meant by that is that there could be a North Korean rocket\n with a nuclear bomb that could reach the USA.\n But why should the North Koreans do that?\n So if the North Koreans attack the US, North Korea will no longer exist.\n So that's the most illogical variant of all from the point of view of non-experts.\n Yes, that's the case. And the Americans are just making it very clear that North Korea will no longer exist.\n That was very clear at the Munich Security Conference, where a number of American speakers took part, including national security advisors.\n And, perhaps a little bit out of the public eye, it was very clearly said there by the American side,\n if there was an attack here, or even the preparation of an attack from North Korea, then we would not only react with a Bloody Nose Strategy,\n as it was called at McMaster,\n so not only with a strategy where we say we hurt you,\n we make your nose bleed,\n but with a strategy that would lead to a result,\n one of the American senators said,\n a result of biblical extent. That is the detero said, would lead to a biblical extent.\n That is the deterrence rhetoric that we hear from both sides.\n But is it about an attack on American territory?\n On islands, California or so on?\n Or is it about American allies?\n The Americans are primarily concerned with the possibility,\n the technical possibility of the North Koreans to reach the American mainland.\n That's where Trump said, it will not happen.\n It will not happen that the North Koreans are able to attack South Korea,\n also with their artillery.\n Seoul, the capital of South Korea, is a few dozen kilometers away from the North Korean border.\n You can achieve this with World War II artillery.\n You know that anyway, and there are so-called American promises of protection.\n And that is divided into armament aid for the South Koreans and an extended perspective of deterrence.\n But for the Americans it is of course something different,\n whether a ally is vulnerable and vulnerable\n or whether they are vulnerable and vulnerable themselves.\n Is this vulnerability accepted?\n Has it been accepted since the Cold War?\n Between the Soviet Union, today Russia,\n and the USA, also between China and the USA.\n There was something called the word of the same weight of horror,\n which led to the fact that armed control agreements were signed,\n that certain trust-building and security-building measures were put in place,\n red phones and all that, to prevent someone from doing it on purpose.\n Or that someone is doing an exercise and the radars on the other side believe it is the real case.\n There were a few situations in the Cold War where you were very close.\n Why is this not accepted in North Korea?\n Many reasons. First, you don't want to increase the number of potential opponents, of course. Who wants that? Secondly, you accept North Korea as not playing in the same league\n as Russia and China. And thirdly, there are the questions in the\n USA, as others ask themselves, whether we are actually dealing with a rational\n actor in North Korea or not.\n You don't ask yourself that in the USA.\n It is, thank God, not quite as it is in the movies,\n that the American president always has this suitcase with him,\n where he would really just open the suitcase and press the button.\n German media before Trump's election played exactly that scenario.\n Yes, that's why I say it's not quite like any media journalist might imagine.\n It's not directly fake news, it's right that there's the suitcase with the code.\n And it's right that the American president makes the final decision.\n But there's a decision chain where others participate.\n And the head of the nuclear command finally even at a conference\n in canada explained and said well it's not that easy there are still advisory\n lines and decision-making lines through which such a decision is made but the last\n decision the president is right the americans have an interest in Korean peace?\n I mean, because of the constant war or weapon-shield situation, you can keep the Koreans up to date. You can have your troops there.\n Yes, but that's not self-interest, right?\n You could call that the Chinese side.

I think such reunification would break the heads of both the Chinese and the Americans.\n Because, well, for example, if you ask yourself, is Korea reunified with nuclear weapons?\n That may not please the USA or China.\n Is it an overhaul of North Korea by South Korea,\n with which you then have the American allies of South Korea directly on the Chinese border, would not make the Chinese very much fun.\n It is like Kim Jong-un suggested all the time, it is an overhaul of South Korea by North Korea. I think that would not please many South Koreans.\n The status quo is something you can live with both sides quite well.\n That's why Americans and Chinese are pretty much in agreement that they don't want nuclear weapons from North Korea.\n Because the status quo also includes the two defense forces of the two Koreas.\n That they have nuclear weapons, but the two Koreas don't.\n And if North Korea has\n functioning nuclear weapons,\n because the discussion is already in South Korea today,\n will one\n discuss there sooner or later\n whether one should also have nuclear weapons?\n And\n the\n most likely option\n is, we have fortunately't have to try it out,\n that the more nuclear weapons there are, the greater the risk that it will actually become an atomic war.\n Does Germany have an interest in the status quo in Korea?\n We have a strong interest in the status quo almost everywhere.\n Because change, especially change that comes disruptively,\n we would never use disruptively as a positive term,\n like Donald Trump speaks of himself as a disruptor,\n as someone who brings things to a standstill.\n Because changes that come disruptively usually create problems.\n Korean peace can create problems?\n No, not peace, but a disruption of the status quo,\n which usually does not come from the fact that two states\n say peacefully over long negotiations,\n how do we create our reunification now?\n What constitution do we develop together, how do we give our neighbors enough reassurance that no one has to be afraid.\n There are a few exceptions, maybe this country we are in is one of them, but it's not the normal case. We have experiences with reunification, North Korea, I don't know, what's better, we are one of the few countries in the west that still have diplomatic relations with both Koreas.\n Why don't we use this opportunity?\n It is also used here. So that there is a North Korean representation, a North Korean embassy is used used to make certain encounters possible.\n The Americans know that they have such a place here that they can use in case of emergency.\n That's not the topic.\n Nobody would mind if North and South Korea would start a process of unification,\n which was similar to the one between the one between the German and the GDR.\n That was accompanied at the same time, it wasn't just a bilateral process,\n it was accompanied with many discussions and negotiations\n with the so-called victors of the Second World War,\n with the Soviet Union, with the USA, with France, with Great Britain.\n And similar things should have happened in North Korea. The worry is not about such a process, but about a collapse of North Korea,\n where there is something like a political vacuum, where the question is who actually fills it.\n Any criminal gangs from North Korea or the South Korean army or the Chinese army\n or the American and Chinese army in the world.\n That would be all disruptive, that would not be good.\n And that would be a completely different process than the one between the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR.\n Regime change is shit. How long does it take until we are rid of the Kim regime in North Korea?"

Who are you?\n Hello, I'm Lena Rohrbach and I work for Amnesty International in Germany.\n I'm going to be 60 years old today and that's why I'm allowed to be here.\n Today?\n Yes, actually today.\n Congratulations.\n Thank you very much. We did well.\n Obviously. Did you celebrate today?\n Corona is making it a bit difficult. We have received a number of congratulations from our home offices, from the German Institute for Human Rights to many private people who wrote to us and congratulated us.\n But such a big celebration, maybe when the pandemic is over.\n Explain briefly, what is Amnesty International?\n Amnesty International is a very large, probably the largest human rights movement in the world.\n We have 10 million members and supporters worldwide.\n In Germany, it's about 150,000 people who are members or support us.\n And we are a club here in Germany, which means we have a very strong office of honor. It is organized in over 600 groups.\n So if you would join MNISTY, you could either network locally with the people from your region\n and write letters for political prisoners, for example. That's the classic.\n Or if you are particularly interested in a topic or a country, you could join a group\n that has a special expertise in this country or this region or this topic.\n But we also have a main office secretariat, because of course not everything can be registered as a volunteer and I work for that.\n Do you hire everyone?\n We basically hire everyone first, but we already have a statute that says that, for example, people position as people of interest are allowed to be excluded from the Ministry.\n Last time we had Kloster Hummel from the railway and transport association.\n They have a guideline that says that members of the AfD are not allowed to be members.\n Is that the case with you?\n Honestly, I don't know. But I'm sure that someone who actively represents people's position as people of interest,\n who represents racist positions, can be excluded.\n This has happened in the past.\n I am a political referent in a political team.\n I am a lobbyist,\n because I don't work in the membership\n or the membership administration.\n And I am not 100% sure.\n If you ask me about specific names or cases,\n I can't tell you.\n Who do you personally support?\n For what exactly? That AFD members can't participate in Amnesty International.\n I think that the AFD represents positions that are completely unequaled with those of Amnesty International.\n For example, when it comes to the rights of refugees, when it comes to the fight against racism, when it comes to the rights of women, for example.\n And whoever represents that actively could not be active at Amnesty International.\n Why are you active? Why did you join us?\n I think since 2013 or 14, which is about the same. I have actually been funding Amnesty\n for a long time financially. I've been doing that for a very, very long time. I still do that.\n I'm basically giving back part of my salary. I can then still live off the rest.\n And I actually became a member when I started working at Amnesty.\n But that wasn't a prerequisite?\n That wasn't a prerequisite, no.\n At the time when I started working at Amnesty, I did support financially, but they didn't know that.\n I didn't say that in the advertising interview, it wasn't asked.\n And then I became a member shortly afterwards, because it turned out to be consistent.\n Why did you apply to Amnesty?\n I wanted to go into civil society. I have always been engaged in various things before, especially in the field of network politics.\n And that was an area that was newly built at Amnesty when I came to Amnesty in 2014, also built up as a reaction to Edward Snowden's discovery.\n I came from university, studied philosophy in my major,\n which was also a great study, which I would do again and again,\n only that I would do it with other subjects.\n And I wanted to become a little more practical now.\n I did philosophy with a focus focused on philosophy and ethics.\n It's a lot about the history of human rights, for example the idea of human rights,\n about questions of distributional justice and the like.\n But that doesn't necessarily become practical.",
      "Did it ever happen that an investigation committee has determined injustice and the region has then said and that's what they have now from the investigation committee are not good enough. I could imagine that it was the case.\n We have also gone against it with strategic complaints. We still have a complaint\n related to the Federal Constitutional Court and in the UK Amnesty also sued against it,\n so our British section sued against it, that actually the communication of Amnesty\n through the GCHQ, that is the British secret service, and we said, we are a human rights organization, we also communicate with human rights victims and lawyers worldwide.\n And it would be very good if we knew that our communication is reliable. And the court, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, is a kind of semi-secret special court, where Amnesty was not allowed to be present at all sessions that concerned it.\n What?\n Yes, state secrets, national security threats and so on.\n And that found out, yes, it was not so good to monitor Amnesty and other organizations.\n First they found out, the secret service said they had not monitored Amnesty.\n It turned out they had confused Amnesty with another, I think, Egyptian organization that also starts with an A.\n Then they adjusted and said, yes, there was an surveillance of Amnesty International.\n It wasn't fair, but only because the data was stored too long after the evaluation.\n That means they have to be stored less long, then they can continue to monitor you.\n But only in the UK, not in Germany?\n Or can the UK Foreign Secret Service keep an eye on you now?\n Well, it's certainly something they don't want officially.\n We were together in the European Union until recently.\n But even the BND has people from the European Union and institutions of the European Union, they say, for the NSA,\n because they no longer had the diversity of the selectors, these are search terms that the NSA then handed over to the BND as a partner.\n That is also the problem with such a mass surveillance instead of a more targeted approach, that you work with so many search terms and data amounts that you might even know that you don't want to monitor a certain institution or something, and you just run away.\n Could you be sure that it is not monitored here in Germany?\n By the constitutional protection or the\u2026\n By foreign secret services, through German secret services? We actually have a complaint from the Federal Constitutional Court against the G10 law.\n And say that because of the legal situation now, we cannot rule out that if we communicate internationally across the border, then it is no longer just German communication traffic that we will be affected.\n But you don't know if you are currently being monitored or not being monitored?\n We don't get any notifications that we have been monitored.\n You have already mentioned the G10 law twice. What is that?\n That is the law that regulates the restriction of Article 10 of the Basic Law and that is the post and email. And we have already talked about the fact that the privacy in this room,\n which also includes communication, the confidentiality of communication,\n is basically a right that can be restricted.\n Where we also say, yes, this can be possible under certain circumstances,\n but it has to happen proportionally.\n There is also a G10 Commission, what does it do?\n Yes, the G10 Commission is responsible for having control over and authorizing communication that is monitored under Article 10.\n But here we have the following somewhat curious situation. the public was not aware that the BND and the federal government are of the opinion that the so-called\n foreign communication, i.e. if someone from Pakistan is on the phone with someone in the USA, for example,\n that they are not protected by Article 10 Basic Law and that they do not have to send it to the G10 Commission,\n which de facto meant that it took place in a free space.\n which in fact meant that it took place in a free space. They have now adjusted it by creating a new body, the so-called independent control body,\n which is now responsible for this communication.\n Are you satisfied?\n I think it's better than if it didn't exist, better than the status quo,\n that the foreign communication took place in a right-wing space.\n But it also contributes to a fragmentation that we already have with the news service control.\n So it's a patchwork. When there are different organs, then it can always be that someone thinks the other is responsible.\n Or small children also go to the parents when they weren't allowed to do something with their mother."

    "response": "\nThe political orientation of the Falter weekly newspaper, according to its editor-in-chief Florian Klenk, seems to lean towards a more critical perspective. He mentions that the FP\u00d6 (Freedom Party of Austria) has become popular due to their ability to create enemy images and connect issues like migration and taxes to the concerns of the general population. However, Klenk believes there is a lack of left-wing representation in addressing the diverse socio-economic challenges faced by the country. Regarding the current government's efforts, Klenk highlights the importance of discussing the weather, meaning the changing climate and its potential impact on the country, as well as acknowledging the need for improvement in various aspects of life.",

      "He won the election because he is someone who has developed an incredible power of conviction in people that something has to change.\n Something has to change.\n But what?\n Exactly.\n Basically he brought two messages.\n First, there are too many foreigners.\n And second, we pay too high taxes.\n And that's a message that was taken into account by many people.\n Is it too loud?\n I think he was mainly concerned with the topic of migration.\n And he has been managing to keep this topic as the only internal political topic in the kitchen for almost three years.\n The NEOs told me once that there are studies that political topics change every three months.\n Three, four, five, sometimes six months is a cycle of a political topic.\n And then comes a new topic.\n The migration topic in Austria has been the top topic since 2015.\n We discuss every topic only with the help of the migration.\n It has gone so far that at some point a political scientist, Peter Filzmayer,\n a very famous professor of explanation at the ORF, said that he probably also argues that the parking lot emergency in the city is also driven by the burka-carriers.\n That means that he almost always sees migrants as the actual problem.\n When we talk about the labour market, when we talk about the security of social systems, when we talk about minimum insurance, when we talk about child welfare. It's always the danger from the outside that he protects us from.\n And that's something that broad parts of the population like.\n There's also a left-wing crisis of sense.\n You don't really know what the left is here for.\n It has little answers to this pluralistic society that we live in here,\n because it always argues economically. We don't have many answers to this pluralized society we live in,\n because it's always argumentated economically, but people are actually threatened by their identity.\n And we have an absolute crisis of the Greens, who have flown out of parliament.\n They are no longer in the National Council.\n And those were important politicians, also in public discourse, they have disappeared.\n Why did the FP\u00d6 get almost as many votes as the former SP\u00d6?\n Because the FP\u00d6 is very skilled at creating enemy images. It's actually quite simple.\n I can bring every beer tent, if I'm a skilled politician, within five minutes to Jolen,\n by tying emotions, by making the other responsible for my own disaster,\n by claiming my identity, by wearing a suit jacket,\n by singing the hymn only in the male form,\n land, mountains, land on the stream.\n And I hear the line,\n you are home, you are great sons.\n And that is now changed into, home, you are home, you are great sons and daughters.\n Women were included, but they still sing in the male form, against the gender war, as they call it.\n So it's a very broad movement. They are now also very strong in the countries.\n And they have a classic enemy image, and that is the Muslim who comes here and wants to run the Islamization of the evening country. You say yourself that they are present in the countries, they sometimes even\n appoint government heads there. We have had the experience in Germany that when new people\n came to the parliaments, they themselves were enchanted. So they were then practically one\n legislature period later gone again. Why is the FP\u00d6 get rid of the legislature?\n I would put it differently.\n To get rid of the legislature means that there was a magic before.\n Or something magical.\n Or that the voters, the people, recognize that they are not different.\n That usually happened. We already had the they are not the others. That usually happens.\n We already had the FP\u00d6 in the government.\n It didn't take long and it melted down to a third of the votes.\n And then it was at 4-5% in the polls.\n That means there was a phase like that.\n But Strache, the current vice-chancellor, managed to rebuild it.\n By betting against those up there.\n Classic right-wing populist metaphors.\n We fight against them, emotion, feeling, on the stomach, not on the brain.\n We call the enemy the inner and the outer.\n The inner is the corrupt journalists, the lies media, the lies press.\n The outer is Islam and possibly the international financial capital.\n They are now leaving that part. The Jews are no longer the role model.\n If they come into power, they usually lose.\n One exception was K\u00e4rnten.",

Because in all of Europe people never really talk about the weather\n and we only recognized through my reforms that we have a problem with the weather.\n And if we don't address the problem with the weather now,\n if we don't realize that the weather that comes from abroad\n will change our country and that rain will come and thunder here, if we don't protect ourselves and really make sure that the weather gets better, then we will be here.\n And I already know that your friends here are of a completely different opinion.\n So, a new episode of Jung Naiv. We are in Vienna. Where are we exactly?\n We are here in the big command center of the Vienna weekly newspaper Falter.\n And who are you?\n I'm the chief editor.\n What's your name?\n Florian Klenk.\n Since when are you that?\n Since 2012.\n No, no, since 2012 I'm a representative of the chief editor.\n Or?\n Good question.\n I think since 2012.\n Yes, since 2012.\n For six years.\n What did you do before?\n I was a deputy editor-in-chief and chief of politics.\n But don't ask me since when, since 2008, so for ten years.\n But it's a relatively flat hierarchy. We're only about twelve editors here.\n Then there are people who do the program, the weekly program.\n Then we have a editorial assistant.\n We have about as many people here in the newspaper as the Spiegel probably secretaries in the D1 resort.\n Explain to our most probably German viewers what the Falter is.\n The Falter is something quite anachronistic.\n The Falter is a newspaper that is printed on paper and is not available for free on the internet.\n You have to pay for it. And what distinguishes the Falter from many other media is that it has a beginning and an end.\n And it's such a real work and people can stick to it and read what's going on politically in this city and in this country.\n And the Falter has doubled its position as a print product.\n So we have increased from 70,000 readers to 140,000 readers.\n Although apparently print dies.\n So we are the proof that print does not die.\n How did you do that?\n By never giving anything away.\n So if you go out there now, maybe I'll give you one, but we'd rather you pay the 4,20 Euro for it.\n We never gave anything away.\n And that led to a solid financial base.\n And for many reasons that were not just strategic, we didn't put this performance on the internet, which others had.\n And so we were able to skip an era.\n Did you already know that back then?\n No, of course not. But we have put every euro or...\n ...I've been here for 20 years, so I've put every penny into the editorial office. If you were to look around, you'd see a office that's not made of steel and glass and chic and with a lot of spec,\n but it's a bit cozy here, relatively small.\n My office is not a huge loft either.\n You don't have a boss office.\n I have a golden wall. The managing manager had me paint a wall with gold.\n Nice.\n So you've been in business for 20 years?\n I've been here for 20 years with a two-year break.\n I was in Hamburg at the Zeit.\n I was there at the Politik restaurant with Bernd Ulrich and Martin Klingst\n and Giovanni Di Lorenzo and all these\n big names and then I went away again from Hamburg and thought to myself\n this little shop here is a lot of fun for me.\n Is it a magazine or a weekly newspaper?\n It's a weekly newspaper."

      "There are many young people who come to us.\n They are not pensioners, but when you see what is being saved on the ground by people,\n these are mostly young people, families with children.\n And it is unimaginable how our society has looked at this over the years and basically done nothing.\n We can do that, others can do that.\n Our European neighbours are no better at making that clear.\n But that doesn't have to be an example for us, that others do nothing to see for themselves.\n That's the sand box principle at the moment.\n Yes, we're taking so much on, but the others don't do anything.\n Or the Florian principle. Let others do it.\n St. Florian, save my house, incite others.\n That can't be a scale for our trade.\n And in that respect, I've lost the thread a bit now.\n I have to think about where I was.\n If young people come from other countries, they want to work, they want to contribute to it, they want to integrate quickly.\n We have to offer language courses in a much larger scope, we have to prevent.\n Do we need more teachers?\n That is a question that has been recognized too late in the past, but this applies to other professions, kindergarten or nursing.\n We will also need thousands of people in this area who will cover the nursing area in the coming years.\n We are dependent on thisify education in all areas,\n also for all age groups.\n More teachers are needed, more professors, but more skilled people in the craftsmanship are needed,\n masters, no matter where, in which field, engineers.\n We will need better qualified people in the future, even more than in the past, need better qualified people.

In the 80, these things came on the market.\n After a little more than 20 years, this is a matter of course.\n A smartphone can do things today that used to be huge laboratories could implement.\n And in that respect, the development...\n I have learned once, the thing can do more than the moon landing program of the Americans in the late 60s.\n That is certainly not an understatement.\n The computing power.\n The computing power is certainly even better. That's crazy.\n The first small computers and computers were not as small as this thing you just showed me.\n Smartphone development is going in a different direction today.\n A slightly larger display and the performance is getting thinner and thinner.\n The size is being adjusted again because you have problems with your eyes.\n But education is the topic of the future and we have to regulate all other things.\n We have to see that justice is being respected a little more in all our actions.\n We see that the gap between rich and poor is being opened.\n We see that more and more people are being excluded or are still being excluded. We now see the problem of immigration, the refugee problem.\n If we don't pay attention, if we don't want to get caught up in it,\n we have to counteract it in time and not wait until others show us where it goes.\n I wanted to come to the difference between integration and inclusion.\n I have learned that with integration I wanted to come back to the difference between integration and inclusion.\n I have learned that there are always two sides to integration.\n Of course, there are those who come and want to integrate, but on the other hand, you have to be ready to integrate people.\n Is that similar with inclusion?\n That's not quite the case with inclusion.",

Yes, but of course, they are burdened, so they have to be relieved and maybe more people with it.\n They need more people.\n Yes, but that's too fast.\n But don't you want that?

There are trade-offs.\n If I had to decide, I would rather use these people in our education system.\n Or even more.\n Why not everywhere?\n Because we don't have that many people.\n We will experience a lack of skilled workers.\n We have the many people. We will experience a lack of skilled workers. We are now in a demographic change.\n The baby boomer generation,\n the birth-strong years,\n born in the late 60s,\n will all go into a state of calm at some point.\n And then we will have a massive lack of skilled workers and workers.\n In the last year's report of the Council of Representatives, we made a chapter about this.\n We only edited excerpts of this question, the shortage of skilled workers.\n And on the one hand it's about further education,\n to better prepare the existing employment population for what they will do along their professional life.\n And to other things about immigration.\n But we have about 40 million employees in the country.\n You could say, dear federal government, we need administrative capacities.\n Please do a mobilization campaign so that one or two million of these employees in the private sector would come to us.\n But as I said, I would rather do a mobilization campaign if it would be that easy.\n I mean, you have to train all the people.\n There were all of them already.\n If there is a mobilization campaign, then I would think more in the area of education, also early childhood education, care.\n Nobody has anything against that. But the people are not shareable. We can't clone them.\n But there are people who are working for 14 million people who do unproductive things.\n Or for the people's economy and our future not so much.\n We can find them.\n We can convince them.\n Look, here you get a job at the state.\n You have a salary. We need you, safe jobs.\n Well, first of all, it's the case that we really don't have enough specialists.\n We just have a shortage now. We have seen this after the Corona pandemic. During the Corona pandemic, we closed certain areas due to lockdowns, for example gastronomy.\n And at the same time we had less immigration.\n Because during the Corona pandemic, the usual flow of immigration was actually overrun because people could not migrate. And that alone has led to significant difficulties that people were\n found in gastronomy. This of course has to lead to the increase in wages, you have to\n adjust the wages.

    "response": "\nThe argument against providing financial aid to Ukraine, as discussed in the interview, revolves around concerns regarding the potential misuse of funds and the lack of accountability in managing the resources provided. Critics believe that the country may not be able to effectively utilize the aid due to issues with economic policies and governance. Additionally, the discussion highlights the possibility of austerity measures having negative consequences, particularly in the case of Greece.\n\nRegarding who might potentially benefit from such aid or its absence, the interview mentions the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU). On one hand, the IMF could gain credibility and influence by supporting Ukraine financially and ensuring the implementation of necessary reforms.

I have a new guest.\n Can I ask you a question?\n Yes, Marc Schieritz, economic and political correspondent at the Zeit.\n You are right, we are doing current crowdfunding.\n Can you explain what that is as an economic and political person?\n People give money for good things, but not via traditional channels, but directly.\n And we're just looking at that.\n We need 15,000 euros, we want to travel through Europe for the EU election.\n That's apparently very important at the moment.\n We can talk about that in a moment.\n Give us money. 5 euros, 6 euros, 500 euros.\n Whatever your mother gave you as pocket money.\n And otherwise... What does it look?\n What does economic policy do in Europe?\n I have now read, we have once again saved the ass of a country.\n We want, we want.\n IWF, I read today, has saved Ukraine.\n How is that?\n Well, IWF plans to support Ukraine with a help loan.\n That means Ukraine gets money from the international cash register,\n which countries like Germany and all other countries in the world have also paid for.\n This money is lent to Ukraine as a loan,\n in the hope that Ukraine can continue to finance the business,\n can keep the state alive and then at some point,\n that is also part of the plan,\n if the country is healthy, this money with interest, as it always is, is repaid to the IMF.\n So we earn with money, like Greece?\n Yes, not directly, because it's not about our national banks, but the IMF.\n It's just IMF, not Troika?\n There are no Troika yet.\n Not yet?\n Not yet. It is also planned that other countries can contribute to this. The IMF gives 15-18 billion dollars, not euros.\n And then a few billion will be added.\n The USA, Japan.\n So that there should be 27 in total.\n Why does Ukraine need the money?\n Do they have such high debts? 200%?\n No, not at all.\n The debts are not the problem.\n The debts are actually relatively low, around 40%.\n Lower than in Germany.\n So half as much as Germany, roughly. Only the problem is that, like almost every country, what the state takes in is not enough to finance everything that is to be financed.\n Now also a little war, possibly.\n And the capital markets, the banks, do not lend the country any more money, because you don't know how it will go on.\n And that's why someone has to jump in and fill this gap.\n And in that case it is the EWF.\n But that has nothing to do with the fact that they want to go to Europe, EU,\n and maybe want to have the Euro. They have to have at least 60% of the state debt.\n Yes, the Euro. I don't even know if they want to have it.\n It would be totally crazy if they got the Euro. So, again, a problem case.\n It has something to do with it indirectly, because Ukraine is already the third program now.\n They have already asked for loans twice.\n Both times the program was cancelled because the deposits were not held.\n Actually, you didn't want to make any more money available, but now the West is so strongly engaged.\n When you say we support you, there is a momentum to say, well, then we have to let that cost us something.\n What conditions are being set there? You say 16, 18 million dollars are given there.\n Two years.\n What for? Is there a saying, we help you or we help you with conditions?\n Yes, as always with the IWF, there are conditions that are laid out,\n they are also fixed in the memorandum of understanding,\n so a loan contract, a loan agreement. And it includes structural reforms, labor market, legislation, corruption fight, transparency,\n it includes short-term cuts, it includes above all...\n Austerity or what?\n Yes, exactly. Always.\n Which doesn't work.\n Which in many cases didn't work.\n And the question is always how strong the austerity will be.\n In Greece it was definitely catastrophic.\n And the hope...\n Do you know a good example of austerity in Europe?\n Where it worked?\n Yes.\n There is actually no...\n One.",

I think your crowdfunders can't give you any money, right?\n That's right.\n They trust you.\n Yes. That would be a thing for Ukraine. Why don't you make such a Ukraine,\n hey, we all sympathize with you, we're doing a crowdfunding now, how much do you need? 15 billion?\n Sure.\n It's not much, right? It's not much. In the best of the world.\n Yes, there are 7 billion people in the world.\n I've heard that half of the world's money is for 70 or 80 people.\n You ask them.\n Yes.\n And without fees.\n Probably the Apple wallet would be enough to finance the country.\n Yes.\n Why don't you do it? Because...\n Because in the end, no one will do it.\n Because, to be honest, you've already seen...\n If you...\n If you lend money to a person... If I were to give you my credit card now...\n Then I might know, okay, you're a sensible guy, it's fine.\n But if you lend money to a country, it's always something in a country and you don't have any money at all,\n and you know that the experience of a country is not always very clever in terms of economic policy,\n then there is a risk that the money will simply be gone. When I was there, I don't know if you spoke to me, but when you spoke to people, simple people, what you always heard is that they said, yes, there was always money and so on, but only the wills have grown bigger and nothing else has happened.\n And that has to prevent it somehow. Whether the policy is the most successful, whether the proposals that have been decided specifically are the most successful, you can argue about it.\n But that you just don't give money to someone in a country without conditions, I think that's right.\n Thank you, Marc Schieritz.\n We're just going to show you that you can donate 5 euros to the EWF so that it helps Ukraine.\n Or you can give us the 5 euros so that we can travel through Europe and, for example,\n to Greece, which can make the internal policy insecure.\n And then we'll see what comes out.\n Thanks Max Schieritz.\n Thanks.\n Bye bye.

Wouldn't bans be better because you can hide something worse without following the actual goals of the incentives?\n Incentive or ban?\n I think both are important. There has been a great aversion to prohibition in politics for a long time.\n I think that's a good way sometimes.\n If you remember, only the elderly can do that, the forest will die, the sulfur emissions.\n Certain manufacturing processes were simply and simply forbidden.\n Ozon is another example.\n Exactly.\n So you said you need both.\n You need both and sometimes the ban is also the way to quickly level playing,\n so to create equality among the affected.\n Nobody can get away with that.\n I think that was the point behind this question.\n You have already half explained it, but I ask again.\n Can you actually invent yourself out of climate change through technology?\n Yes, I think so.\n I don't know exactly what the question is, but I'll say my answer as I understood the question.\n Steel production in its previous form is always connected to greenhouse gas emissions, inevitably.\n And the technological development that we have made in recent years, which we have also contributed to this, is a shift to electrostal or, and that is actually what I am now\n mainstreaming, to hydrogen, to green hydrogen. And that is a technological development.\n And in this respect I say, yes, technological developments can be a solution.\n But of course you can't think technologically away from climate change.\n And if you then, if behind the question is what there is also as a debate, geoengineering,\n so to shoot particles into the air in high, high-altitude stratosphere,\n in order to reduce the radiation, the radiation power, so to speak,\n these are all things that I completely reject. We are close to Star Wars concepts.\n What is your opinion on lobbyism?\n Why do corporations have so much more money for the same as for example Fridays for Future or striking nurses? Yes, first of all, if an industrial association is committed to economic interests, that is lobbyism.\n And if I, as a NABU, have committed myself to environmental protection and nature protection, that is also lobbyism.\n And now the question is, is the greater economic power the decisive factor?\n In my experience, honestly, not.\n Really not?\n No.\n So when would Fridays activists or also Scientists for Future, when would they ever\n have taken influence on the formulation of legal texts?\n Yes, but they have, I think, one thing I didn't even talk about with Thilo, I think\n the Fridays movement has a self-perception error, namely that it is not successful.\n I think it is one of the most successful movements and I know that industrial floors are also shaking.\n Without this movement, at least so much would have not moved in the last legislature period and in the current legislature period.\n It has to do with the co-operation of parliaments.\n And that the constitutional court verdict was a groundbreaking verdict,\n that always happens in the background of social realities.\n And also in conversations at kitchen tables, from children with their parents. And that is a great success, which has not been done with money,\n but with great conviction, also with great penetration.\n And that's why I think it's not just about money.\n Is that wishful thinking, that powerful corporations or bosses are trembling in front of the Fridays and others?\n Or is it real experience? You have personal contacts with people who work there.\n Did you actually experience that?\n Yes, but it is so.

Because we're going through completely different conditions.\n So the key point is how do I achieve the standard of living through an increase in quality, which is ultimately also growth-related, and to proceed with a resource-saving approach.\n For example, this can be recreated.\n And that does not logically correspond with the claim to growth that is still represented by you.\n You don't say, or I didn't hear and read that, you don't say growth only as far as the absolute of the resource does not exceed.\n No, we're not going that far.\n Yes, but the question is, if we discuss this in the long term,\n in view of the question of when the resources are so exhausted that our Earth cannot survive anymore.\n For example, at 2. how many degrees?\n Yes, but then we are at a very specific point.\n And at 2. so and so many degrees ...\n I mean, I can of course try to set quite general demands in a great design\n of circular economic ideas of the post-growth movement to make quite general demands.\n I think that in my opinion this brings zero to the problem solution, if not even negative.\n When we talk about the two-degree goal, then we ask very specifically how we can achieve that.\n And then I say, let's get to a CO2 price of 100 euros per tonne as soon as possible,\n then we save CO2 and have a chance to reach the 2 degrees.\n We will also need an international agreement for this.\n It will not go without.\n And we will also have to have accompanying measures so that the public industries are not damaged too much,\n so that we can move forward with new technologies, hydrogen and so on.\n But that is a very specific task and it is much more important to me at this point.\n In terms of circular economy, I have now become more or more open in this respect,\n because I think that we can now come to more concrete ideas on how to implement them,\n than we tried 20 years ago.\n Also with sanctions?\n Yes, of course we also need sanctions for that. That would be bans? than we tried 20 years ago. Also with sanctions?\n Of course we need sanctions for that.\n That would be bans.\n No, I mean, a ban always means an claim of absolute authority.\n I can understand and sign the ban on nuclear energy very well.\n I am always very careful very careful with other prohibition provisions.\n So I think you have to try to solve the goal conflicts in a\n decision-making process as far as possible, while a ban always has an\n absolute claim. I would not necessarily want to define circular economy in the sense of a ban,\n but if we move in this direction,\n then we can bring regulations and thus promises that can bring us in this direction.\n Two last questions.\n Armin Laschet is now probably accepted by S\u00f6der, Chancellor candidate of the Union.\n If he were to ask you, would you like to become an economic minister, yes or no?\n There is no such thing? Yes or no? There is not just a yes or no either.\n Oh.\n No, the point is simply that ...\n Maybe.\n Yes, exactly. There is always a maybe and at the end maybe a assessment.\n I have to say, I don't really feel like going into politics.\n First of all, my job as a professor at the university is much more important and much more pleasant.\n And on the other hand, if it is specifically the Ministry of Finance, then I would probably reject it.\n Because the possibilities of design in the Ministry of Finance are relatively small.\n The economic and political possibilities of design are in the Ministry of Finance. Ah yes, that would be more interesting for you. But that's the party again, possibly, who knows.\n No, we don't know how the federal government is. as a liberal social person for the legalization of cannabis.\n Would that have an economic impact, a benefit or disadvantage?\n Can you calculate that?\n Yes, I find it difficult to calculate, but I have always used myself for the legalization of cannabis\n early on.\n So my fascination, as described by my first teacher, Werner Pommerene,\n arose from him using himself for the liberalization of drugs. And at that time his idea was not only to use cannabis, but to continue. As described by my first teacher, Werner Pommerene, it was because he used drugs to liberalize himself.\n And at that time his idea was not only to use cannabis, but to go further."

      "That's my claim. Scientifically, so really so that I It's really complicated to write in a comprehensible way.\n That's my claim.\n I can represent it in front of scientists.\n What I like about all three books is that my colleagues at the universities use them in their teaching.\n At the same time, they should become popular books.\n Not popular scientifically, but so popular that everyone could read them and who want to get informed about it. And that is then\n a really big challenge with a super precise gendered loop-line language.\n But I take them on. So with wozo-racism, related to racism in the language and related to sexism\n in the language, I have put a lot of effort into it. That means, however, that ...\n But there is correctness before beauty.\n Yes, that too. But this challenge, to take these things out of the language, has become a major part of the work.\n And that's why I can't just celebrate it.\n Andreas Stein, can you imagine that the European Union can become a place of identity,\n an identity that primarily defines itself through values and not through origin and national borders?\n So I hope so and it indicates a lot, but there are also certain\n tendencies that are problematic at some point. the identity movements in all possible directions in the integration paradox in every direction.\n So nationalistic identity, racist identity, as well as religious fundamentalist identity.\n These are becoming stronger movements all over the world.\n And that has its reasons, we don't have time to discuss that now.\n But it's not that it has to be totally frightening, but it is already the case that you have to have it on the screen.\n Yes, but identity means, especially if you take the term in its psychological, social psychological dimension, not necessarily identity.\n Identity also means to know, to have a feeling for who you are individually, collectively.\n The question is, is identity oriented by values?\n Yes, exactly.\n I think that's possible, but the current, which is not oriented by values, but religious, nationalist, racist identity, they are getting stronger.\n That's just what you have to have on the screen, that it is no longer how it seemed a few years ago, that liberalism and the open society are now setting through and liberal\n democracy, which was still possible a few years ago or a few decades ago, can no longer be\n determined in loops. So alone the flagship of the open society, the liberal\n democracy, the USA, have become extremely identitarian. And ident and in a not always good sense.\n The last cards. Lex Loof, what can or must school do if the parents are racists?\n Very good question. They have to do all that, at least what I write in the two chapters in what racism is about. Regarding the institution school, there is a lot to do.\n I describe how you can identify racism in your own institution.\n Not every institution is the same.\n The problem with institutions is that they prevent or enable the participation of people in modern society.\n At the same time, an institution has different functions and duties.\n In the police it is about security and order,\n in court it is about legal proceedings and so on,\n and in school it is about the selection of children and the education of children.\n The clientele is different.\n In the police, criminals are usually in the school,\n theoretically a cross-section of the children, but not through urban segregation.\n Then there are the processes, how transparent they are.\n If things are not transparent, it is always problematic, if you cannot complain in neutral places,\n it is always risky for problematic behavior.\n And the general framework also plays a really big role.\n And the professions, how are they trained? How are teachers trained?\n All of that has to be taken under the umbrella. And then for pedagogical professions I do four.\n So I divide what pedagogical professionalism means in this decade in terms of racism in four competence areas or four focus areas\n and of the four focus areas, hardly anything is really fulfilled. This is the crash course,\n that is, it is worth reading the book. Yes, absolutely.\n The royal discipline is children who grow up in a household that is massively racist,\n that it is made possible that these children can emancipate themselves from it.\n That is the king's discipline and I fear that we are not yet good at it.\n Do you leave personal questions?\n Do it.\n Try it. What is that, Gurgel or something, 42.",
      "And we can't deny that, because we\n talked about it earlier. But we can do that in our normal spectrum. And that would be\n exciting to observe in these studies where the stereotypes are removed, where more diverse societies come together, whether then in a few hundred years our brain will no longer do that.\n So these automatic unconscious differences that take place on a neuronal level are no longer there. Evolution and adaptation, because it is simply clear that a society is colorful and diverse.\n In how far this is then implemented linguistically or perhaps also changes, language creates realities.\n It's a totally exciting one.\n I don't know what it's about, no idea, that we use these words there, whether it comes from there\n or whether there are studies that have examined exactly that.\n But I would now argue from the perspective of solution-oriented thinking again,\n if we have certain tendencies there and, for example, something like black work, black money and so on,\n then let's see if we can talk about it differently.\n So tell other stories.\n And to tell a story where these things are not potentially linked in our brain and thus open a box where something negative is bad.\n And I'm just wondering if that's a good trick, from people who speak of the old white man, whether that's a good trick to challenge them with, because they feel like they've been kicked out of the game.\n Or whether that's counterproductive.\n So, counterproductive in the sense that if he feels kicked out of the game, because then of course a defensive attitude happens automatically.\n So when I say, Thilo, I think that this and that sucks or what you do or what you stand for,\n and I think that's stupid or bad or whatever, so what negative does that give you?\n Well, what will your first reaction very likely be?\n You're right.\n Right. Very likely she will.\n Maybe after today's conversation.\n Let's see.\n That would be great.\n But the first reaction will of course be,\n no, will of course be, okay,\n defense attitude.\n But if I go there now and say,\n Tilo, I see it this way and that way\n and that creates something for me,\n so I send a message, that and the feeling creates that for me when you say that or I feel attacked or something.\n Why are you doing that?\n Then we can have a conversation.\n So, to ask the question that I find so important, what is it really about?\n So why are you doing that?\n Do you have it yourself or the old woman, whatever, white man, yes?\n Is he afraid to lose his status, to question his worldview? Is that the reason or the argument?\n And I can only try that, it doesn't mean that you can get there, but try to understand,\n by not going to a confrontation course and looking at what separates us and making accusations against him or her, I can also be a woman,\n but rather say why and what is actually happening right now and do we have a goal that somehow connects us?\n You've heard of the cross-thinkers, right?\n Unfortunately, yes.\n Do cross-thinkers really right? Unfortunately, yes. Do cross-thinkers really think in their brains?\n I don't know if there are studies on that. It would be interesting.\n You always say interesting when you say, I don't know, food tastes interesting.\n From my perspective and my understanding of what they think, and I haven't been totally intensively dealing with it, and what I know about the functionalities of the brain, it's more like they don't think in a square, but the opposite.\n Because we're back at this point with the safety.\n Thinking straight.\n Thinking straight, yes. That they don't think in a square.\n Nice wordplay.\n Because they naturally try to understand the world and create and get security.\n And therefore draw light explanations.\n For example, they believe, they are convinced, whatever,\n that certain people have put the coronavirus into the world\n or that it is a huge combination of important, powerful,\n I'm trying to use the words there now, that's my opinion,\n who have come together and said, this is how it is now.\n That's a simple, in the sense of clear, understandable explanation.\n We are exactly back to these categories and the questions we asked earlier. Black, white, I can somehow\n distract myself and can then sleep calmly at the end of the day, in the truest sense of the word, because I understood it.\n And that makes my brain no longer insecure."

Exactly. Although I think he wouldn't say it was home.\n Well, you can define home like that or like that. But something where he felt\n in a contradictory, broken way, belonging or belonging. felt like a part of him. Exactly.\n He always felt like a part of him.\n His family history is that\n his parents were Jews\n who emigrated to England\n and then decided to live in the GDR after 1945.\n So it was also a Jewish identity.\n And a left-wing identity and that\n has occupied him all his life. Is that actually a feeling that you had yourself?\n You were born in the GDR, grew up here, were also politically active in different ways in the family circle\n with opposition and consent.\n Is that a feeling in this line, I want to stay where I have not been,\n something that also makes up part of Annette Simon?\n Yes, not as I wrote it back then.\n My parents belonged to the construction generation of the GDR and I was relatively identified at the beginning.\n I was a young pioneer and was a religious young pioneer, so to speak.",
      "These are the actual divisions that are interesting to me.\n And that's why there is a dispute,\n that's why I'm making it so extreme,\n between two pretty similar people,\n maybe very different in gender, but otherwise similar people 30 years after the unity,\n these experiences of the attribution are a bit counterproductive.\n This is a different split in society that I find more dramatic.\n And there this comparison also caches from Muslims and East Germans,\n caches the real racist reports in this society.\n It always bothered me and I find it a much more serious problem.\n I would like to go into this, because Hans said something very important. I think that a real racist rumour in this society has always bothered me and is a much more serious problem.\n I would like to go into this, because Hans said something very important.\n The initiative is above all a reaction to the political changes in the country.\n And I think we have seen in history that it was not always these radical borders that led to the problem, but it was a silent middle.\n And you have a problem when a progressive majority is put in a drawer.\n And we still have the situation in East Germany that the civil society does not organize itself as well as, for example, in the West, because it was not built in the West, for example, because that was not the case in the GDR. And that's why it was so important for us to create an identity opportunity, to say,\n yes, we are the East, yes, we are the progressive majority. That's what it's all about.\n We also want to bring you in and I found a first icebreaker,\n namely Juliane Schreiber, formerly from Jung & Naiv, has reported and wants to bring in a perspective.\n You can of course react to it afterwards.\n Hello.\n Some of you know me, I've been a young and naive editor for four years and I'm currently sitting at an article as a freelance journalist, which deals exactly with the question from my own perspective, why do I feel East German?\n I was born in 1990 in East Berlin, I always say, and the first ones always bother me, say why is it German all over the place and then I say no, I was born in May and in October\n it was the reunification and I still have such a stamp in my passport and then people come,\n well, but you haven't experienced anything from the GDR anymore.\n And I think that's a very interesting point, because then I always come with,\n yes, but my parents shaped me and nothing has changed at home.\n And then I found two points in the research on this article that defined for me why I and many people in my environment who were born in 1990 and later feel East German. And that's one thing that's very strong, the so-called othering, which Daniel Kubiak at the HAU Berlin also researched, who also works with Nike.\n He says, Germany is always West Germany. That's the case. And everything else that deviates from it is somehow a special case, a special case.\n And because of this experience, that you realize, okay, you always deviate a little bit from the norm, you create the identity that you actually have,\n namely, I am different somehow,\n and this feeling of being different somehow,\n that strengthens very strangely\n and then becomes stronger and stronger.\n And the other point that I want to address\n is the evaluation experience of parents,\n which is very well carried out.\n In our family, my parents were very strongly influenced by the Wende.\n Unemployment, they had great jobs and afterwards everything went down the drain, so to speak.\n And this evaluation, it characterizes you very strongly and you can see it very strongly in many in my environment.\n And I think to claim that you don't get it wrong,\n that's just not true.\n And I just read this very nice article by Alexander Osang in the Spiegel.\n He writes from Germany\n that it's a bit like the long-term wave that is finally going to grow out of Germany.\n With this picture, I would say\n it's good that this long-term wave is not yet growing out of Germany,\n because maybe it is also a chance, this inequality and injustice, this question of participation and opportunities,\n which still exists very strongly, that this generation maybe still has a sense for it and says,\n hey, we haven't reached this point for a long time.\n Yes, I find it very interesting, because I also believe that those born around this time\n are very influenced by their East German parents and partly East German teachers.\n And it's a generational experience and you can't just put it away."

My first parliamentary speech is about why, even with an energy change and if we now turn off the 20 dirty-skeleton coal-fired plants, why then still not a single light bulb would go out, because we have such a massive power surplus.\n I remember this formulation quite well, the only light bulb that doesn't go out. Well, no, not the only one that goes out.\n Now you are the energy and climate speaker of the left.\n Exactly.\n Are you trained in it? Are you an expert in it?\n I'm not an expert, but I have ...\n You don't have to be with the left either, do you?\n I don't know, I'm also a bit skeptical about this idea of expertism.\n I think as a politician you have the opportunity to read into topics and work into them.\n And I'm actually a historian and historians, at least in my studies, had a very good opportunity to discover new things, to deal with sources,\n and with the help of my colleagues and the referendums in the Bundestag, I think I have already been quite deeply immersed in the matter.\n But it's not just about actually having expertise, like any technical connections, but also to have the view\n for the social.\n That means, what counter-powers are there?\n What is against us?\n Why isn't it done,\n what is actually necessary?\n And that's a little more than\n just technical knowledge.\n You could have said that you have a natural scientist\n or a climate researcher\n in the faction. Then it would be logical to make her a climate-politician.\n I have no idea if we have a natural scientist, but I have ...\n Is your faction so big that you don't know everyone? I actually don't know what every single one of them studied or every single one of them studied.\n There are 57 people and I don't know that, actually not so.\n But I think for me it was the right decision, because I always care about parliamentarism and movement politics, about the connection and I already measured myself in this\n to be in the topic and as I said I don't think of this expertocracy and the federal government\n has already set up various expert committees and the results were not always so that\n something actually happened so we need So we need experts, we need\n scientists and we have to go back to the knowledge we have. But of course we have to be able to apply that\n and then we have to be able to convey it in society.\n And in this respect, parliamentarians are then also something like node points,\n communication points, so to speak, to transport knowledge into society.\n Now you've come to the Bundestag and you've become a speaker\n of an important issue in your faction. How did you do that?\n I mean, you don't have 57 different spokesmen, do you?\n We actually have quite a few spokesmen.\n So every member of parliament gets a spokesman?\n There are a few members of parliament who don't have spokesmen.\n But in fact climate and energy policy has become even more important during the legislative period.\n I think at the end of 2017 one could not yet see it clearly how important it would be.\n And I think in the left-wing faction it was also a bit of a niche topic.\n And I also set myself the task that a bit of a ...\n At the end of 2017 it was a niche topic.\n It was still a bit of a niche topic within the left-wing community as a whole.\n And I held that as a problem and set myself the task to bring the topic into the center of politics.\n And there was a little support from the climate movement and the development.\n Did you have to sit down with someone? Did you join against Sarah Wagenknecht or something like that? No, I didn't have to argue with Sarah about this post.\n It was clear that she would become the chairman of the party and that she would take on this job.\n And insofar as the job has just been released, my predecessor Eva Bulling-Schr\u00f6ter\n didn't get elected to the Bundestag anymore. And I thought it was a good opportunity as a new member of parliament to keep a lot of talks and to train there and to get in there at all.\n And that has also been fulfilled a bit.\n In my opinion, since Fridays for Future, the climate issue is no longer to be thought of from the big media.\n How often do you get talk show invitations and so on?",
      "If I am a left-wing person and I love to vote for the left,\n but for example climate protection is the most important topic,\n then it seems as if the left is like, yes, yes, we see that too,\n but you are not pioneers.\n You could somehow make the Socialist Party an eco-socialist or so on.\n Why are you so time with climate protection?\n You are in Brandenburg, the government is building coal here.\n As long as possible, it is still being defended.\n Well, these are different topics.\n The ecology has been recognized in the meantime.\n Katja Kipping is the party chairman,\n who has always been in the meantime. Katja Kipping is, for example, a person, the party chairman, who has always been on this topic and that has also been done in the party.\n Of course, ecology is always connected with the Greens, that's why they're rising so much now.\n Yes, but you could overtake the Greens on the left, or overtake the Greens, because the Greens are always pushing more and more into the middle.\n Yes, I say, that's true, they are pushing towards the Union. And above all there is a difference. They always want to make anti-ecological behavior expensive.\n And with that they try to reduce it.\n And that's never my way.\n Because I can, for example, make gasoline so expensive that you can't drive anymore, but I can drive.\n That means I make it a privilege if I make it expensive.\n That can never be the way of the left.\n That's why I always call the left ecological sustainability in social responsibility.\n The left have to ensure the mobility of everyone.\n You have to think about that.\n And there can be future projects of various kinds.\n So I believe that ecology plays an increasing role in our country,\n but always takes social responsibility with the sign.\n And with the brown girl it's about the understanding between the SPD and the left, which of course wasn't that easy until when, and about the conversion.\n Many people live there and you have to ask for a perspective.\n Now I say again, the East is much more educated in conversion than the West, because we had to remove all the NVA support points and had to come up with something that would be of use to the people.\n Which was very difficult, but you can solve it.\n Of course, coal is not the future.\n Again a movement that made sense, which prevented the ancient forest from being cut down just to win the coal.\n The left would always be there.\n But if you are in charge and you have thousands of people who live off it,\n you have to find a way where you say, we still have to get out, but we will do this and that for you.\n And the federal government helps, especially the country of Brandenburg, too little.\n There are a few countries that are more dependent on it than others.\n And then the federal government has to say, we will also give you funds for that, etc.\n But it is very difficult to do that, especially when SPD and the left govern together.\n And last question, ecology. Why is the left not against Nord Stream 2?\n Against what?\n Nord Stream 2. From 2050 we are not allowed to use natural gas, it is also fossil fuel.\n We have to be zero percent emissions. It's kind of an unnecessary project.\n We already have too much ... Is that with Russia? Yes, Nord Stream 2. 0% emissions. It's an unnecessary project.\n Than with Russia?\n Nord Stream 2.\n Why aren't you against it?\n Because there are contracts.\n I can't sign a contract and commit myself to it\n and promise Russia and then say,\n now I have changed my mind,\n do what you want, I don't need it.\n Maybe you can change it. That can be that you can have a different approach. There is something else\n you should not forget. Two problems for Germany. Of course, for example, you can\n grow grain, vegetables, fruit in Italy much better and harvest than in Germany. A warmer climate.\n I still think it's wrong if we can't feed ourselves.\n Because then you become dependent.\n And with energy it's similar."

At other points you can be more critical.\n Could you question our economic ways?\n The Council of Representatives has all the possibilities to tackle economic and political issues.\n So you could also say that our current economic system leads to a climate catastrophe, we have to change our economic ways fundamentally.\n The Council of Representatives could do that.\n But you didn't do it.\n No, for good reasons.\n Because the climate crisis is not there.\n Not only because the climate crisis is not there, but because we can also defend it with instruments\n that are very effective for climate protection and, secondly, are well anchored in the market economy.\n That's it.\n So ...\n Yes, that's the key point.\n Climate protection with market economy, although the market economy or capitalism has brought us into this situation.\n Climate protection with market economy is possible, of course.\n I mean, a market economic instrument is the CO2 price and it is highly effective.\n So why should you change this basic principle?\n Of course, the board of trustees is bound by its mandate.\n And in the law of the board of trustees, which determines the mandate, it says that it has developed its analyses and different possibilities for economic policy on the basis based on market economic order.\n So, overthrowing the market economic order,\n that would be difficult for the Council of Representatives to agree with the mandate.\n You could say, people, you have to change that.\n Yes, always change.\n Of course you can change something.\n A higher CO2 pricing means changing something.\n We're talking about decent prices, not the small stuff.\n Do the members of the economic community have to be independent? Are you independent?\n What do you mean independent and value-free? That's a long discussion.\n If we go back to Max Weber, the idealy, you have to say that every person, including every economist who comes to the Council of Comprehension, has their own values and is not free of them.\n You can't be, you're not schizophrenic.\n What, however, and this has been developed very nicely by Karl Popper, which ultimately leads to the freedom of the science, not the individual scientist.\n That is the competition among the scientists.\n And in this respect it is important that very different people from different areas come together in the board of directors.\n And that's what they tried to solve from the beginning, that you ask one member of the union, is that someone you can live with?\n And in the other direction, namely the economic associations, the employers, is that someone you can live with?\n These are the two tickets that have a certain association orientation.\n I formulate this very carefully, because there formal right to suggest anything on both sides. It has simply been established that in normal times, at least in the early stages,\n when it comes to finding someone for the board of directors,\n you also connect with the unions or the employers' associations and then try to find out if that's okay.\n On which ticket are you? and then try to find out if it's okay. What's your ticket? I'm on the ticket of a financial scientist, because since 1974 there's always been a financial scientist in it.\n So someone who knows about public finances and it's obvious that someone does that.\n But do you support the employer side or the union?\n The unions would say today, because I was appointed by the labor commission as a scientist, that I am close to employers.\n But I'm not close to employers and also not close to the trade union.\n You are close to the CDU. You are the chairman of the scientific committee of the CDU-Economical Council.\n The CDU-Economical Council is a construct in which many people are involved who have nothing to do with the CDU.\n But you explicitly discuss the CDU with them.",
      "But I have a lot of contact with the social market economy, with Alexander R\u00fcstow\n and, I would say, the school of thought of German order policy.\n It was mainly about the question of how to break up cartels, how to regulate markets properly.\n I can win a lot from that, but the question is also how to do thatels, how to regulate markets, I can win a lot from that. But there is also the question of how to translate that into the future, or rather into the present.\n And I think an update is certainly necessary there as well.\n Which economist or which economist influenced you the most?\n Now let's get away from the liberals, so to speak., you could also include Keynes.\n I think there is no economist in the real sense.\n Karl Popper influenced me the most, but I think he also liked to read about the economic world.\n His idea of piecework technology, I can demand a lot from him, also in political action and also his thinking about probabilities, uncertainties,\n such questions that are also in the book of the black swan by the author Nassim Talebkin, who also relies a lot on Popper.\n I can win a lot from him. I would say he is one of the more important thinkers that impressed me.\n Then comes the question back to the FDP, what distinguishes you from the internal position of the FDP?\n Let's make it even more concrete, now you are finance minister, the FDP appoints a finance minister.\n If you had to say what distinguishes your financial position from Christian Lindner, position, then that would be? Then that would be the circumstance that I would not say immediately with every question of taxes,\n no, it doesn't exist with me.\n Okay, interesting. Then in W\u00fcrttemberg, there was the so-called scandal in the summer,\n that thousands of teachers were dismissed over the summer,\n so teachers who had temporary positions and I think\n refferees. Although you have a lack of teachers, like almost in\n all of Germany, does that fit together? Why did that happen?\n First of all, we have to move it straight. It's not about the civil servants and teachers,\n but those who are, for example, in the reff, but those who are in the referendary or employed.\n That was a state that existed for many years.\n The coalition decided to put it off last year and the issue is resolved.\n That means that these teachers I just mentioned will be paid in the summer holidays in the future.\n Also referendums?\n I think so.\n I think that... I would have to look into it, but...\n Because those were the two classic cases, right?\n The teacher of the department,\n temporarily employed, not employed,\n not employed and the referendums.\n You mean yes?\n Yes.\n Okay.\n With the referendums, I...\n We have to look into it, but for those...\n We have to look into it.\n Honestly, I'm not quite sure about the referendums you brought me to think about.\n I don't think it's referendums, but the employed teachers.\n And we have closed this gap.\n Okay, I understand. Paying teachers is a personal expense,\n consumption expense, so to speak, from a householder's point of view. Do you have room to\n hire more teachers soon, to close the gap? We have just said goodbye to a household\n and have also made some hundred new teaching positions available. It's about classical teachers,\n but also about\n assistants in the schools.\n But it's also about the directors,\n who have a lot of bureaucratic, administrative work\n to relieve.\n You have to create compensation capacities for that.\n We have created a basis for that.\n Is there more? Yes, there is more and more.\n But I also want to say,\n teaching positions, deputies, as it is said correctly,\n in the household, is one thing,\n to find the people, to inspire them for the teaching profession,\n that's something else.\n I think we still have to see how we can do better,\n how we keep the job attractive.\n I think we still have a task ahead of us.\n There was also a discussion about NC. Why is NC so high?\n It's scary. You should also be aware of that.\n So that the threshold is lower for people.\n Good question. I'm not a cult minister. I don't know the details.\n But we have the topic as another construction site."

      "So you really have to find very, very good reasons to restrict basic rights\n and you have to question them all the time.\n I think that's too little to do.\n You also have discussions now, we'll get the relief soon,\n and that's actually like you almost have a proof of merit.\n No, that's actually the other way around.\n You would have to reason every day why you're not doing it yet.\n But that doesn't drive everyone around.\n These are things that drive me around.\n I always found it good to live in Germany, I have to say.\n Because I think that was always a point for me.\n You can be annoyed about many things, but there are certain things that are simply set.\n And in comparison to many other countries, they are also much more clear.\n You can certainly question that now. I hope that it all comes together again.\n But that, for example, I find extremely important and would be a crucial point for me, whether I want to live in a country or not.\n And that's why many countries are falling out for me,\n because I don't feel like living in such regimes.\n Even if the countries are great and the people are nice.\n We can talk about freedom and the corona measures later,\n but political attitude is also clearly disturbed by the left and the green.\n The inequality is growing in the country.\n Is the inequality of wealth disturbing you?\n In general, I would say that injustice is disturbing me.\n Social inequality?\n Social inequality, if it is innocent, I find it difficult. I think, for example, it is of crucial importance that we have access to education, that it costs nothing.\n I think that's a high value.\n That's why I also find access to health insurance and health care extremely important.\n And those are values that are also important, because I believe education and health care is a kit that also holds a society together.\n These are things that are important so that everyone in society can also find a way.\n And that means access to education and access to health.\n But social inequality is often talked about wealth tax.\n I think sometimes these are just extreme measures. For example, I am not one of those who are unhappy, but the question is,\n is that a war decision or is it more important for us, how does society work anyway?\n These are of course things that are extremely clear.\n But political scientists always point out that it is\n dangerous for democracy if the rich always become richer.\n So I think what would be dangerous for democracy if we really drifted apart\n into such a upper and a lower class. And I think a great value in Germany was always that\n we actually had a relatively wide middle class.\n It is in principle to keep that, although the middle class, to be honest, does not automatically only focus on the net income,\n but also on things like quality of life, access to education, health and so on, so life conditions.\n The salaries are one, the wealth is the another. Would you like to pay your assets tax?\n I don't think it would be a bad idea to have to pay assets tax.\n I still think, even if you say with assets of many billions,\n that it has to be like that, I think it's the wrong approach.\n And I think, openly, it wouldn't be enough to cover the financial deficits we might have.\n It's a bit good, you feel good, you have given something away.\n Could help, right?\n Yes, I don't know if it really helps. There are many calculations that say, it sounds placardously enormous, but at the end of the day it's not enough to shoulder this volume.\n People might not be that rich again. You can only take away limited money.\n Do you belong to the upper class?\n Hm?\n You just spoke of upper class. Do you belong to the upper class? I saw you came in a Bentley backpack.\n I think I belong to the upper class.\n You mean the one who drives a Bentley?\n I make a good living, of course. I also work a lot. I probably count as one of the better-earned.\n Upper class is a term we know more from systems like England, where there are also old aristocratic structures.\n There is often a formal status associated with it. We don't have that in that form, thank God.\n I'm not a fan of monarchy, who wouldn't think so.\n In this respect, I think the term Oberschicht is difficult.\n But you belong to the top 10%, right?",
      "Are these the right priorities?\n I think basically citizen's and child's pension are super important and we should absolutely consider both.\n But your finance minister prevents this through the debt-brake principle. The question is whether we should make taxes in this case\n to change these concepts or not.\n And I say, I think that's not possible.\n I would like to say\n because some people, I was asked last time\n if you are for the debt-brake,\n you are against social policy.\n And then I said, I am not against social policy,\n but I am for the next generation to have so much money\n that they can also pay for social policy.\n I think that's a bit of a jumping point.\n Then it's a fundamental question now. Why does the extremely unequal distribution of wealth limit\n why does this extremely unequal distribution of wealth\n not actually limit the freedom of most people in Germany?\n The thesis behind this is that the extremely unequal distribution of assets restricts the freedom of most people in Germany.\n You as a defender of freedom should actually say, we have to change that.\n I find the point totally exciting, because the question is, is that the case?\n Do other people have less freedom because other people have money?\n And I say that's not the case.\n The question is, do I have less chances because another person has accumulated something, for example, or wealth.\n Does economic power limit political power? Is it social power?\n Yes, of course there is social power, of course.\n But that's why I say, I've already said that in the question of wealth,\n we have to create fair rules of play in which someone with a lot of money cannot restrict my freedom.\n Yes, but if someone with a lot of money, who has a company, offers jobs,\n can say because of this power, I'll pay you this or that,\n then the freedom of the one who is looking for work and has no wealth is restricted.\n And that's exactly why I'm in favor of not focusing on individual persons or\n individual politicians, but that we say, that's why there is a market and another provider to which you can go and say,\n I am not satisfied with this condition.\n But we have just found out that it doesn't work.\n That's why I said, I want to adjust the legal conditions.\n Okay.\n Uhm, you asked that?\n I think it's very interesting that many who have a very critical attitude towards power accumulation in the form of money,\n but don't have it when it comes to the state.\n Yes, because money in the, let's say, capitalist private market economy is money, private property,\n whether it's private as a single person or private as a shareholder or something.\n While state is a social organization.\n Power in the hands of individuals is perhaps another category\n than power in the hands of a social form of organization, don't you think?\n I think so too. That's why we have different rules in our state life together\n and in the organization in which organization of the state, 100%. But I think basically a certain distance from when you say, okay, we don't want to see\n capital concentrated in one form. I think you need that also with state power,\n which is concentrated on state action. That's why I find that interesting. That's why we have the division of power, among other things.\n Here we are asked,\n which three taxes would you abolish if you could\n and which three taxes would you increase if you had to?\n That's a very good question.\n Okay.\n Which taxes would I abolish?\n First of all, the foam- tax, which I find bizarre.\n Especially before the historical background.\n The imperial fleet.\n The imperial fleet in the first world war.\n Then I would deduct the steering tax in general.\n Coffee tax, alcohol tax, alcohol-prop tax and foam tax.\n And that's because they don't even have a social added value.\n So it's not even the case that the money that is then taken is somehow stuck in health prevention or something.\n But it's just there because it was introduced once and was forgotten to be applied again.\n And because the state thinks that by using these taxes, it can control social action.\n So to direct people on the right path. Less coffee, less foam, less alcohol.\n I think that's weird and it makes no sense and it's not justifying.\n So you could put them in one place. Are not CO2 certificates mechanisms that follow exactly this same principle?\n They should unfold a leading effect."

      "Has Monika Schnitzer ever felt the invisible hand of the market?\n The invisible hand of the market.\n That's another metaphor for the economy. Yes, again, the idea is that people behave in their own sense, maximizing profit, maximizing profit,\n they don't care about what everyone else is doing.\n And how by a miracle it comes to a nice market result, where the goods are offered\n that I want to have and the companies make profits because the people buy it and\n no one has taken care of it. This is of course nonsense insofar as this market\n of course only works when I, I mentioned it earlier, when I have designed nice rules.\n For example, when I make sure that there is competition,\n when I make sure that consumers are informed about the prices,\n when contracts are passed and so on.\n It takes a lot of rules to make such a market work.\n But then it's actually like this, when I go to the supermarket and think,\n what am I buying today because I want to cook something tonight, then I don't think about what my neighbor is going to buy or how the weather is on Sunday or something.\n Then I buy today so that I can buy the right thing.\n Then the sausages are not cheaper at the other end of town for 50 cents, but I want to have it now. For example. But that simply means that in many situations I buy it for myself,\n which is useful, without thinking about it. Why did the manufacturer offer me this now?\n And this manufacturer wonders how I can make a profit by putting any product there.\n And then hopefully someone will buy it.\n So is there an invisible hand now or not?\n There is a coming together of people on markets where everyone ...\n Or is there nothing invisible? People come together and buy and sell and in the end one made a profit and the other\n bought a product.\n What is the answer?\n Is there now the invisible edge of the market?\n Would Hans-Werner Sinn say?\n What does Monika Schnitzer say?\n This is a construct that should clarify or show that I don't have someone to control all of this.\n I don't have one planner who says, today we produce five of this and six of that and then distributes it.\n But that's a godly metaphor, Monika, the invisible hand of the market. The market as god.\n I haven't seen that as a religious picture yet. That would be strange to me.\n Then is the answer now a no? Did I understand correctly?\n That's fiction?\n That's fiction.\n That's why there is no invisible hand.\n Of course there is no invisible hand.\n We have that, yes.\n Back to your career. You even have a degree in state debt, right?\n No, sovereign debt played a role.\n Sovereign debt is state debt?\n Yes, exactly. It's about states possibly having debts with other countries.\n It's about international debts, that's what I was talking about.\n That's a long time ago.\n Why did you get interested in it?\n At this point, the contract theory plays a role again.\n When countries get liable internationally,\n then the question is,\n can I even assume that these debts are repaid?\n In the international context,\n I can enforce contracts, at least not so easily.\n There is no world police, right?\n That's exactly the point.\n The interesting thing about the contract theory is that there are also situations where I cannot\n enforce contracts.\n Then I have practically incomprehensible contracts in the sense that I cannot write a contract\n and be sure that there is a court that will enforce it.\n That is exactly the problem internationally.\n That means I may sell someone something international and\n I can't be sure that he'll give me the money, because how am I supposed to do that?\n I don't have international legibility. So between states ...\n You could do it with the US.\n Exactly. So between states that work closely together, there may be such\n a cooperation where that works. But if that's not the case,\n then there's only the possibility of being washed in somewhere.\n That's not done anymore.\n Maybe they did that a hundred years ago, but not anymore.\n Today, there are sanctions like one state not paying its debts\n and if they land on the other side of the border with their planes,\n then I might confiscate the plane.\n But otherwise I don't have many options.\n And that's exactly the question of how I can still make sure that I behave well.",
      "I think it would be good to add to that,\n to take personal data with an order,\n because if there is a gas shortage,\n this data...\n Then you need it to be able to distribute it.\n Exactly. Ultimately, you are in a situation of rationalization.\n Nobody wants that.\n But if a situation of rationing should occur, I think it is the most just and important thing to have this data.\n Sind, question concludes, with what you have now suggested, students and pensioners,\n also finally considered or do they fall through again? Students and pensioners are just as part of the gas price break as everyone else.\n So, just as the gas price break is now equipped, all gas connections in Germany are basically in there,\n regardless of who is behind it.\n On the company side, there is still the question of whether conditions are created\n that companies may decide not to participate. But on the household side,\n everyone is automatically part of the gas price break. These pensioners, students, everyone who has a gas connection.\n Again, jump to the USA. Did your work in the USA bring you a new view of Germany that you could bring into the or\n at the discussion and review of the report? Very interesting question. So I think so.\n So I would say that there is somehow a different all it takes-takes mentality. The threefold boom.\n The threefold boom, which is actually quite party-driven.\n And that's a different mentality.\n I have the feeling that in Germany you always like to look at the basic principle first principle and then you look at the concerns.\n And then you come to a conclusion.\n And in the USA it's like, what is the big picture idea? How can we do it?\n Exceeding questions.\n Exactly. And then questions like, are there any problems with principles or concerns?\n So that the order is simply designed differently.\n There is a question that says, why is Germany so much fixed on the black zero, especially in the Ministry of Finance?\n Is there a historical fear of hyperinflation or what is it? Yes, so that is actually a point from an American perspective\n that is very difficult to understand.\n So this austerity logic in Germany is in my opinion\n already very strongly pronounced.\n I don't even know if that has to do with inflation\n or if it's more like this is to do with the culture of saving.\n There was also an exhibition in the German Historical Museum where it was presented as a very culturally anchored idea of saving is good, which also has a protestant element.\n We have to save today so that we can be there tomorrow.\n Calvinism is striking.\n Exactly, I think that's culturally very strongly internalized.\n And that's why the tax breaks seem so intuitive to many\n as somehow very meaningful.\n Although I don't think it's particularly sensible\n and especially in a crisis situation like the current one,\n where there are really existential questions in the room,\n to say that the principle of the black zero is more important to us\n I personally think, to be honest, that's almost absurd.\n And I also think that even before the current crisis, there was a situation where the German state would have been paid for it.\n We had negative interest rates, to take on debts. in future technologies, in digitalization, you name it,\n I think illustrates how extremely vulnerable you can be\n when you put the black zero over all these substantial topics.\n So, now some questioners are waiting.\n What do you think of the MMT, Modern Monetary Theory?\n Yes, so first of all I want to say, I think there is a lot of lowball criticism of MMT,\n which is often quite personalized and often often comes from misinterpretations.\n Something like MMT says that the state can spend as much money as it wants and that inflation never arises.\n That's not true, because at least Stephanie Kerlton always said that.\n The state can print as much as it wants,\n but it can't issue as much as it wants.\n Yes, or the question is not, can we pay for it,\n but can we resource it?\n If we issue money, then we have to ask ourselves,\n are the resources behind it,\n to materialize these issues?\n So, at this point, I am against this So that's why I'm pretty critical of these hand-wavering criticisms of MMT.\n That wasn't a nice sentence, but I think you already understand what I mean.\n But I'm not a MMT person myself.\n I've also dealt with money theories in detail and come from a different direction."

      "And then and then you could say okay and those, there are no...\n But still, basically you have to say really clearly in which areas of the state what exactly to do.\n Even with the classic state investments, think of the traffic infrastructure.\n I don't want us to have eight-lane highways everywhere, pulled tightly through Germany.\n I don't think that's right. I actually think that we have to see\n that in all necessity, where there are new and new buildings that may be necessary because of me\n in some places, the basic principle must be, especially in the sense of climate protection,\n in the next few years, that we put more traffic on the tracks.\n No more highways. That's what the Greens say, for example.\n That's too radical for me.

They have to be removed.\n Everything that is climate-damaging has to be removed.\n We should definitely take off climate-damaging subsidies.\n I think we should take off tax incentives and subsidies in general,\n which are unfavorable.\n So not only for climate protection, there are also other areas.\n I would not take the diesel privilege, but the service car privilege.\n I would abolish that, for example.\n Why abolish the service car privilege, but not the diesel privilege?\n With the diesel privilege we have different environmental policy requirements that we have to discuss. On the one hand, what concerns the CO2 problem, diesel is typically cheaper than gasoline.\n What concerns the NOx problem, it is not cheaper.\n Either you do it in such a way that you differentiate between CO2 pricing and pricing for other pollutants,\n for example NOx, or we find alternative solutions.\n I would have preferred it, and it is the case, that I would have preferred,\n if we approach the control, to have a wide range of measurements\n without any major exceptions.\n I would actually prefer that.\n Back to your career. Can you briefly tell us, you wrote about your doctorate.\n Yes, so first of all, after my studies, or at the end of my studies, I studied in Saarbr\u00fccken and at the end of my studies I went to stay in the field of minor business,\n I spent hours in the clinic as a nurse.\n I was an assistant at Pomarene for a year, from 1993 to 1994,\n after my first phase as a doctor, so to speak.\n And then he died of a heart attack. Then a few weeks\n after that I was asked by his assistant if I wanted to move to St. Gallen to finish the dissertation\n there and then I did. At the confirmation? Yes, well, I just said that Werner Pomerene\n was part of the Freischule. This is a very friendly collegial association of professors.\n And the early generation of Freischulers were just as old as Bruno Frey himself.\n And they had a very good contact with each other.\n And one of these colleagues, Gebhard Kirchgesner, asked me if I wanted to come to St. Gallen.

      "when trains run in attractive speed frequencies between the regions and these trains are reached again with buses.\n That would create an alternative. If the alternatives are not there, as they are today in large parts,\n then people will also feel a CO2 tax on petrol and fuel as injustice and be against it. On the other hand, you could be in favor of banning cheap flight tickets\n or make them so unattractive that they are not even cheap flights.\n Is that an option?\n So cheap competition will continue.\n 19 euros in Mallorca, that's perverse.\n Yes, that's usually not true.\n So if you book the ticket for 19 euros, it's still printed on the ticket.\n But let's just assume that.\n I'm talking about real prices.\n In the air traffic it can't go on like this.\n It's completely clear that you need a reasonable, environmentally friendly control.\n That's up to you.\n Also to make other means of transport more attractive, such as the train. But of course, if I put the\n air traffic in one corner, the train has to deliver on the other side.\n And if the train doesn't deliver, what we have experienced in the last 20, 25 years\n of the train, that was reconstruction, closed railways, railworks have experienced from the train. That was reconstruction, train stations closed,\n train stations at best also closed. I am glad that now, at least according to everything\n I hear, there has been a turn in that direction and the German train has to be\n even better. Personnel traffic and even worse, freight traffic.\n If you now drive towards Hannover on the Autobahn, you only see trucks, you don't see any landscape anymore.\n And that's why freight traffic has to be much stronger on the tracks. But the prerequisites have to be there. There was a big majority of non-voters in the last election in 2014. How do you want to get a non-voter from Brandenburg, who is watching right now, to vote?\n Or him?\n Or do you prefer to stay at home than to vote for the AfD?\n Well, no.\n It would be better.\n I think it is really crucial that the non-voters in this year's election, which will be crucial for the direction to us now, otherwise something will happen that we certainly don't want to happen.\n And then of course to look at the parties and say that this or that party has my trust here\n or this or that person and then go to the election and vote.\n And in any case,\n vote for people who\n stand for the country to develop well,\n that the country remains a solidary country,\n a country that stays together\n and not to vote for haters and right-wing populists.\n That would be my wish.\n The election is on September 1st. Thank you, Dietmar, for your timewing populists. That would be my wish. The election is on September 1st.\n Thank you, Dietmar, for your time.\n That was great.\n Bye, bye, bye.\n Bye, bye.\n Bye. Thank you. so Thank you. you"

    "response": "\nTwo union politicians protested against the implementation of health centers in the German healthcare system. One was a union member of parliament who argued that the health centers were a model created by Regine Hildebrandt, associated with socialist medicine, and therefore undesirable. Another union politician, Mr. B\u00f6hmer, questioned the labeling issue, suggesting that the term \"health center\" could be replaced with another word to satisfy the opposition.",

      "The BMG, the Federal Health Ministry, of law, but a draft of work in which\n what the politicians had previously called the cornerstones, so that should now be changed,\n that should be reformed, they have rephrased it into a draft of law.\n This is a very demanding task in terms of craftsmanship.\n And in this draft of law it was stated that health centers should be allowed to provide medical care with various specialties.\n And then suddenly a union member of parliament protested heavily, no, that didn't work. Health centers, that would be the model of Regine Hildebrandt. We saved the little bag of polyclinics in Brandenburg.\n We commissioned an institute to convert them into a non-profit company.\n How can that work? And it worked excellently.\n In L\u00f6wenau, in Potsdam, we had several of them.\n That was really followed, as it was called in the German\n medical journal, from the outflow model to the preliminary project. So that really proved itself.\n And we called this project health centers. And then a union\n member of parliament protested loudly, no, that was Regine Hildebrandt's model of the old GDR and that was\n socialist medicine and we don't want that. And then another union politician came, that was Mr model of the old GDR and that was socialist medicine and we don't want that.\n And then another union politician came, Mr. B\u00f6hmer, then prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt,\n and he was a civil service chief physician in a gynecology.\n And then he came to the officials and said, you are intelligent people, you can't think of another word.\n And then the colleague from the union faction with the department head of the Federal Health Ministry\n withdrew and then we got on it, in the USA there are medical care centers,\n we call them medical care centers.\n And then we just replaced this word and the MP was satisfied.\n With lawmaking it can be absurd.\n The label is the problem.\n Yes, the wording is the problem.\n It's absurd, but it is.\n Nothing has changed in terms of content, only the label has changed.\n Why do we have to find prices in our healthcare system?\n Why is it important that it is determined how much my doctor gets for it,\n if I have a broken leg and he is mending it?\n Why is that not...\n Doctors and hospitals also have to calculate their costs.\n And that's why prices are not just what is paid.\n These are also so-called administered prices.\n These are basically more benchmarks than prices.\n They give what the average costs are.\n The health insurance companies pay average costs for defined treatments.\n And there are also institutions at the same time.\n Are we productive? Yes or no? These are business, but they are also economic enterprises.\n They also have to calculate. They also have costs.\n And that always falls into such price calculations.\n If there were no prices, if you just said that they are all employees at the state,\n they do their job like teachers, the costs would also have to be calculated there.\n That means we would have to ...\n No question. But there are not being calculated.\n No, but that is inevitable in our system.\n You can do that in state systems, like in Sweden, etc.\n That is not a problem, although there, for example,\n health care facilities that exist in Sweden\n are managed by the municipalities and they get a budget.\n And this budget must of course also be distributed\n to the parts of this facility.\n And of course such cost calculations play a role.\n That you say, here more costs are falling, we need more staff and so on.\n There is the higher effort, we have more patients, the demand is greater.\n So in this respect, all this must be calculated.\n There are no market prices in the health system. These are all administered prices, they are determined like this. There are no market prices in the health system.\n These are all administrative prices, which are determined by institutions.\n So in the hospital there is the INEC, the Institute for the Development of the Old Money System in the hospital.\n So you can make a lot of money with terms from the health sector, from health policy.\n Have you ever thought of any famous term? Is there any of you? In the health sector, in our health policy, you can gain a lot from Scrabble.\n Have you ever come up with any famous term?\n I can't remember.\n It may be, but no, no, no, no.",
      "Who does that, fails in general.\n Because it depends so much on chance.\n For example, when I was in Bonn, I met an old buddy from the university.\n In the first Green Bundestag faction, he had a job as a scientific employee.\n And he said to me, we have no idea about legal health insurance at all.\n Can't you tell us anything about it?\n And then I went from the Greens as a secretary\n to the inquiry commission on structural reform of the legal health insurance.\n I was appointed as a secretary.\n And then politicians were made aware of me.\n And I was recommended by the SPD.\n I was not a member of the party at the time.\n And then I became the general secretary of the\n government in North Rhine-Westphalia and then coordinated the health policy of the SPD-led countries\n on the professional level . And then I am, because that was after the change,\n a big hike from North Rhine-Westphalia to Potsdam, to the government in Brandenburg.\n And then my then head of department became state secretary in Brandenburg. And then my then head of department became state secretary in Brandenburg\n at the legendary Regine Hildebrandt.\n And then he picked me up and he didn't have to ask me for long,\n because I actually always wanted to go back to Berlin.\n What do you do as a general principle? It's about the political structures,\n that is, about things like the reform of the legal health insurance.\n The countries generally have more supervisory functions\n and executive functions in the health care system,\n but not so much in political design,\n although they can have a great influence in the federal council.\n And we also had a regular voting round at that time\n among the SPD-led countries,\n where we then commented on what the federal government\n was then Bl\u00fcm Minister, we commented,\n have developed counter-design and so on. Also belong to other things\n write speeches, although for Regine Hildebrandt I wrote this speech,\n that would have been complete nonsense. She has free of the\n Nose has the away spoken, so you had to write no speeches.\n I delivered a few numbers and that was it.\n But for other ministers, yes.\n I also wrote under pseudonyms.\n From my bosses.\n That's the job, that's the special thing.\n How was it when you were a young man,\n or I don't know how old you were,\n when you first dealt with the German health system\n back then in the West?\n What did you notice?\n What I noticed first was that no one at the universities talked about the relationship between doctors and patients,\n but that it had become a huge economic branch.\n That was already observable in the 70s. The health system a huge economic branch. That was already visible in the 70s.\n The health system as an economic branch?\n Yes, that was hardly discussed.\n That only started in the mid-70s,\n when the discussion of the cost explosion in the health sector started.\n Back then, it was still with Heiner Geisler, the CDU politician.\n And that had consequences. And it became clear for the first time that\n the health care system is also an economic problem. So not\n only about the good medical care of the population, but that\n there is a whole lot of money behind it, so a lot of money is also\n involved in economic apparatus, that a lot of money is earned. That then gradually became the case and actually classrooms for health\n economy or something were only built in the 80s. What seems to be natural today was\n a complete sensation and completely new at the time. Can you give us a short break? I mean,\n I learned at school that the pension insurance and health insurance were introduced under Bismarck.\n Did they look like they do today?\n No, not at all.\n The big break in the legal health insurance was after the Second World War.\n Until then, the legal health insurance was a health insurance.\n 60% of the expenses were spent on sick leave.\n It used to be that, until 1969, it was legal that employees in the civil law book\n were charged with six weeks of sick leave.\n Workers didn't have that, they got a maximum of three days.\n And otherwise, the health insurance company was responsible.\n That was abolished in the 1950s, this was already abolished,\n only through tariff contracts."

If it is only possible or even likely, then they don't have to.\n That is listed. That means you look to see if your product is on the list. There are categories\n of products on it and you look to see if one falls below that.

This is a standalone due diligence test that has not been provided before,\n for which we have done a lot of work and where we have also made a certain success.\n The EU-Dulius-Order has been reformed and now there is such a due diligence test.\n And that it also applies to the definitions of surveillance technology,\n that it is only about hidden surveillance technologies and not open ones?\n Yes, we had a lot of conversations about that.\n We were very much committed to the fact that this word, covered, is used.\n Why did they include it?\n The official argument is that it would otherwise be too difficult to distinguish, for example,\n the facial recognition of your cell phone.\n You are still able to export cell phones with a face that automatically distracts you when you look inside,\n without having to make an application at the Wafaa every time.\n We were of the opinion that it is very easy to distinguish between the identifying and verifying facial recognition technology.\n One is the one that just checks if you are it.\n And the other one answers the question,\n is this the person she is pretending to be?\n And the image I have saved here,\n and it is looking for this single match\n and the identifying facial recognition technology.\n That's where you put a camera on the street\n and it scans all people\n and tries to find out who these people are.\n And the camera is an open surveillance measure?\n Exactly, that's why we used it.\n It doesn't fall down?\n So that's a typical job we do.\n Besides writing letters, we also look at these legal texts and say, hey, there's a cover in here.\n And then we did research.\n We published this report, said European companies are delivering face recognition technology to Xinjiang.\n There we see massive human rights problems and risks. We have covered this report here, please spell the word, so that also visible surveillance technology is basically authoritative.\n They didn't do that. They didn't do that, but they still have the possibility to take on biometric surveillance, if they want to.\n Another limited progress of the reform of this export regime for surveillance technology was was that there is a European list. I just said that until now...\n The watch list?\n Exactly, right.\n Until now, Europe simply exported the list from the Vassna agreement.\n That means Europe could only control export things\n that Russia and Turkey want to control.\n Because, as I said, it can't be that Europe can't grow beyond that\n and can say, we also take our own list of goods and say,\n we in the European Union want to control biometric surveillance systems beyond that.\n And there is such a list now, but it is not binding and it is not yet clear what will be on it.\n It has a declaratory character.\n Yes, that's funny.",

What position do you take?\n There is one in the Bundestag, party-wide coalition, Huawei should be excluded from our 5G infrastructure.\n Are there other opinions?\n Yes, we are even responsible for it.\n Many claim that they are responsible for digital, but we do it.\n We have a triangle here, so to speak. The first is the explanation of the firm, which must sign ten or more points that guarantee and comply with them.\n They can promise you everything, right?\n That's why it would be too little on its own. The technology that you use is certified by our Federal Office for Security in Information Technology,\n a top authority that is absolutely international.\n And the third is, if the company is disrupted because it gives a false statement, because it\n manipulates or updates the certified product afterwards, for example,\n when it is installed.\n Then we can suspend the operation.\n This is our suggestion to the the company."

    "query": "What is the historical background of the German health insurance system, specifically mentioning the role of the Berlin Insurance Agency and its influence on the GDR's insurance system?",
    "response": "\nThe German health insurance system has evolved significantly over time, incorporating various influences from different periods. One notable aspect is the existence of the Berlin Insurance Agency, which played a significant role in shaping the system. Post-World War II, there was a focus on rebuilding and establishing a new healthcare system. The Berlin Insurance Agency, introduced by the Magistrate after the war, served as a unique insurance entity that combined pensioners, sick, unemployed, and accident insurance under one roof for all citizens, including self-employed individuals. This model was considered a role model for the GDR. In West Berlin, the system had a unitary insurance, known as AOK, which still existed at the time. However, in 1958, the West German system was adapted, leading to the replacement banks in Berlin being able to recruit members. Despite these changes, the Berlin Insurance Agency's influence on the GDR's insurance system remains evident, particularly in terms of the integrated approach to covering multiple aspects of healthcare needs.",

      "He said, every few years a new one so that nobody can get used to it. So this is such a complex system and it is also highly susceptible to lobbying,\n to interest politics.\n That's why it's almost excluded\n that there is a perfect system.\n That means, even if, let's say,\n tomorrow there would be a coup in Germany,\n a revolution, we could do everything again, then we would be in a big...\n Then there would be a chance, but who wants that?\n I mean, the German unification was certainly... there were many opportunities to make fundamental reforms.\n But one to one, this system that has long beenneeding system from West Germany with this professional-based\n gliding principle, as I said, a system that is like a So in this respect, it's... So...\n Yes...\n Excuse me, I need to have a sip.\n We still have enough water.\n It's not...\n It's...\n After the war, there were also considerations.\n The English wanted something similar in their area as the in their area, but they let it be quickly.\n In the Saarland, the French introduced their central system, but that was also changed during the integration of the Saarland into the Federal Republic at the end of the 1950s.\n In Berlin there was even a unity insurance. The Berlin Insurance Agency was introduced by the magistrate after the war.\n It was an insurance agency where pensioners, sick and unemployed and accident insurance were under one roof.\n And it was for all citizens, self-employed and so on.\n And that was actually the role model for also built up in the GDR.\n In West Berlin, the system, at least in the health insurance as a unit insurance,\n that is, AOK, was still alive at that time, but then in 1958 the West German system was adapted.\n So the replacement banks in Berlin were also allowed to recruit members. So there has always been this consideration, but that is today, I don't waste any thoughts on it.\n Because, apart from the fact that a political majority is not even quite at the back somewhere in sight,\n I would also have my problems with it.\n So that would be, you can sometimes strive for reforms,\n they give more trouble than success and that would be the case in this case.\n You are at least a bit naive when it comes to young people and we sometimes think a bit utopian.\n That's why I ask.\n I get the question all the time.\n It's not necessarily enlightening.\n Actually, you should really say, why don't we do it like in the education system.\n There are all employees here and then they do it themselves.\n As I said, it would be conceivable if only after very, very difficult historical changes.\n And even then, you would probably have other concerns than to build something new.\n And I see that quite pragmatically.\n When we talk about Europe, we also hear a lot from social democrats, left, green.\n Europe must become more social.\n Can you imagine a European health insurance system?\n For God's sake. No. I think that especially social insurance is dependent on the proximity of citizens.\n And if you would organize that in a European way, then the whole resistance against what is going on in Brussels even more strongly. They can do that. That is also the principle.\n You are also agreed in the EU that every country should please keep its own\n social security system first. That you should not\n continue to centralize and balance the systems.\n I think that's reasonable.\n So we already have, actually,\n in this respect, this is not a problem\n because every European citizen or EU member\n has a right\n in the respective country\n if he is on vacation or otherwise\n to be treated for treatment.\n This is secured.\n There is also our own authority\n who organizes the whole procedure.\n What is it called again? This is a department of the GKV-Special Association,\n which regulates all these foreign relations to other supply systems.\n There are also contracts with countries like Turkey, which are not in the EU,\n especially because of the guest workers who then go back to Turkey. So how do you deal with these, how do you call them again, insured people with a residence permit abroad? And yes, when you are on vacation,\n you have to pay an extra insurance in non-EU countries. Foreign health insurance. Are there any rules of thumb in the health care system?\n Hmm, yes.\n I'm thinking of, for example, 80% of the costs for 20% of the patients.",
      "So these are the ones who have contracts with the cash offices, the members must also\n since 1933, 32, be a compulsory member of the\n cash association. And the health insurance association agrees or agrees with the health insurance companies\n on a total allowance, that still applies today.\n That means, the payers, they get it, to put it simply,\n for the number of insured, today, according to their health insurance structure,\n certain total allowances.\n So if a health insurance company, for example, example, has many elderly and chronically ill people,\n then they pay more to the cash register association\n than cash registers with a younger and healthier member structure.\n And the cash register associations then distribute this money\n according to a self-defined fee distribution scale\n to the individual medical practices.\n This is a very complicated system that must be written down annually. The so-called\n evaluation committee of doctors and health insurance companies is responsible for this.\n When did the PKV become a full insurance?\n It has always been. It has always been. That was also the case in most other countries.\n These health insurance systems, as they are today,\n or the health care systems, are mainly...\n You differentiate between beverage systems and Bismarck systems.\n So beverage systems are state-owned health care.\n That's the National Health Service in Great Britain,\n that's also the case in all of Scandin Scandinavia, Italy and Spain.\n So there is no insurance, but everything is financed by taxes?\n Everything is financed by taxes. There is no social insurance as an extra.\n The Bismarck model of social insurance exists in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France,\n and in most Eastern European countries,\n and the Benelux states.\n So the Western European model.\n And the special thing about the German model is that\n we have, besides the separation into private and legal,\n which is no longer available anywhere else.\n So when these systems were introduced everywhere,\n the private businesses were reduced to reduced to the additional insurance.\n There is no more full insurance, although in certain areas it is actually one.\n In England for hospitals and so on. In any case, every citizen is there basically insured either through a social health insurance or through a state-owned care system.\n And that's how it came about after World War II.\n And in Germany, this break was already with the Nazis, which I have already said, in 1934, without me wanting to criticize it now, that was actually a right step to do that, the spare cash, because that was also all employee cash,\n that was the idea, we are now building the whole thing into an employee insurance.\n But the officials remained untouched by it. That was always untouched. Then the Basic Law of the Office Status has also been adopted as to promote and so on.\n That is still said today, if we abolish the welfare system, then we will achieve that with the office status.\n But that's nonsense, because the Basic Law says nothing about it.\n It says in the law of the office that that the state must take care of health care.\n But whether it now takes over 50% of the private insurance or the share of the employer,\n as with other employees in a social health insurance, is actually ultimately irrelevant.\n This is a very irrational debate that we still haven't managed to overcome it.\n But it is a highly complicated matter and I don't know if I will still experience that we have a really full civil insurance.\n In Holland, it took 20 years for this project from the declaration of intent to final realization.\n In 1987, the so-called Decker Plan was set up in Holland and the ISS was finally implemented in 2006.\n So that's really a very, very complex area.\n It's always easy to participate in a debate, but you shouldn't promise that you can implement it from today to tomorrow. So constitutional points of view play a role.\n A very important reason or a very important obstacle on the way to the civil insurance, for example,\n are these retirement benefits.\n That's 240 billion euros.\n From whom?\n Yes, from private health insurance companies.\n So they have their own fund to cover the costs of aging, from which they then cover these costs of increasing age,\n so that no contributions with age-increasing costs are required.\n And so the health insurance contributions are mainly aimed at the age of entry. The later you enter a private health insurance, the more expensive it gets.\n And from a certain age, at least from 45, it is no longer worth it.\n And from 50, the private hospitals hardly take anyone on."

It's not viable's no longer viable and we're consuming resources and energy.\n I got stuck with the term panic.\n I think the emotionalization of the topic is not good.\n I think we are only able to make such extensive changes with reason as those that are now necessary.\n So I think that only then will it be possible to do this with international cooperation.\n My only hope regarding this is that China will be able to drive the rest of the world into a climate-friendly future,\n when it's time. I have little hope that this will happen in the context of the current power situation\n in the world, that we can really achieve reasonable climate goals. It's crazy that we, or that you now have to wait for an authoritarian, dictatorial state,\n because our free democratic society cannot do that?\n It is indeed a big problem that authoritarian states are much more flexible in matters of control, that's for sure.\n But apart from that...\n They don't need a democratic base.\n It's not like nothing happened. A lot has happened in the last few years.\n We agree on that, but it's not enough.\n There is the Paris Climate Agreement. Whether that's enough or not will be shown. Just because there is an agreement doesn't mean that something is done against it. That is currently the criticism of all opposition parties except the AfD and all climate associations,\n that the federal government has signed this contract, but no measures.",
      "They don't give a shit if the world gets 3% warmer or not, because that won't change much about their survival.\n They have a completely different standard of living.\n If they had the same standard of life as we do, then we would\n consume the resources of six planets. Currently we consume three. We have to do it\n so that it ... There will be an adaptation process. Of course, that changes\n constantly. Of course. Sure. Yes, and then the panic comes into play again. We just can't do that.\n You can't get any faster with panic. Why should panic help?\n What's the use of panic? Why do you insist on panic?\n Panic in the sense of screaming.\n Screaming too loudly.\n But screaming will happen everywhere.\n Yes, but that's the point.\n Screaming is everywhere, people have been talking about it for 40 years.\n You also joined the Greens because of that.\n But it doesn't happen enough.\n We consume the world three times a year.\n We can't find a way to limit it all at once.\n We can decide that now. We decide that it has to go faster.\n I'm afraid the world doesn't care about it.\n I think that you have a dilemma from your position of power and what you know would be reasonable.\n And you think panic would help you to create a balance between this power and what is possible.\n That's not the case. I don't think panic will help us.\n Another example is with Corona. Two weeks ago Lothar Wieler, you probably know him from RKI,\n he also pushed panic in a press conference in Spain. He made this Dolomite comparison,\n where he said we're going to the Dolomites with 100 things and want to take a 30th turn with 100 things. That's actually also...\n Have panic, what we're doing is life-threatening.\n That's exactly the same thing. And that's what we've come to.\n It's the same thing with the population when pictures like that are used.\n I haven't really connected Lothar Wieler with panic.\n I see him sitting there quite calmly and use arguments. And I haven't seen him being turned around or anything.\n I bring panic with turning around in connection with...\n But Gritta doesn't turn around either, she just says...\n No, panic, the demand for panic includes the demand\n to go over the normal processes that are used for opinion-making and to go through an\n state of activism that blurs out counter-arguments, blurs out who is against,\n no longer allows, pushes everything aside that is somehow in the way. And of course you can want that.\n I don't think we can get to that point.\n I think we still have to count arguments in a democratic legal state.\n And I am very much attached to this form of civilisation.\n For me, panic is the opposite of civilisation.\n That means I have to talk to those who have a different opinion.\n But that still happens.\n It's just being driven by the immensity of the problem that many who have the knowledge still deny.\n If you notice that the EU has decided to become CO2 neutral by 2050, then that's a decision that would have been unthinkable ten years ago. Completely unthinkable.\n And that decision was made because reason has moved an incredible amount.\n Now let's go ten years further. Then other decisions will be made that will probably be far more sufficient. But it will not be the panic that brought us there,\n but the reason, the knowledge of arguments, the interaction of states. We are sitting here in an\n incredibly civilized process. Five years ago we talked about it, when the Brexit comes,\n what comes next, who goes next, Europe breaks apart. Now Europe is sitting there and is making such far-reaching decisions.\n I think we're in the process of achieving a lot with reason.\n That this might be perceived as insufficient.\n I can understand that.\n But you won't change that by saying that it's not enough, I'm going to turn it around now.\n You're probably right that the catastrophe has to happen first, until we really...\n That's my fear, yes.\n But that's shit, that we, even though we have the reason to know...\n You don't have to tell me that, you have to explain it to Mr. Bolsonaro and those who elect him.\n We can't just take over Brazil.\n No."

    "response": "\nLena Rohrbach works for Amnesty International in Germany as a political referent in a political team. She is also known as a lobbyist due to her involvement in the organization's work. Her primary focus areas include surveillance, targeted surveillance, trade with surveillance technology, and some aspects of arms export control. Regarding the participation of Alternative for Germany (AfD) members in Amnesty International, she believes that the AfD represents positions that are fundamentally different from Amnesty International's values, particularly in terms of human rights, refugee rights, fighting racism, and women's rights. As a result, individuals who actively represent these conflicting stances might not be permitted to be active members within Amnesty International.",

      "\ud83c\udfb5outro music plays\ud83c\udfb5 so a new episode young Jung & Naiv. We're in the studio. I have a new guest. Who are you?\n Hello, I'm Lena Rohrbach and I work for Amnesty International in Germany.\n I'm going to be 60 years old today and that's why I'm allowed to be here.\n Today?\n Yes, actually today.\n Congratulations.\n Thank you very much. We did well.\n Obviously. Did you celebrate today?\n Corona is making it a bit difficult. We have received a number of congratulations from our home offices, from the German Institute for Human Rights to many private people who wrote to us and congratulated us.\n But such a big celebration, maybe when the pandemic is over.\n Explain briefly, what is Amnesty International?\n Amnesty International is a very large, probably the largest human rights movement in the world.\n We have 10 million members and supporters worldwide.\n In Germany, it's about 150,000 people who are members or support us.\n And we are a club here in Germany, which means we have a very strong office of honor. It is organized in over 600 groups.\n So if you would join MNISTY, you could either network locally with the people from your region\n and write letters for political prisoners, for example. That's the classic.\n Or if you are particularly interested in a topic or a country, you could join a group\n that has a special expertise in this country or this region or this topic.\n But we also have a main office secretariat, because of course not everything can be registered as a volunteer and I work for that.\n Do you hire everyone?\n We basically hire everyone first, but we already have a statute that says that, for example, people position as people of interest are allowed to be excluded from the Ministry.\n Last time we had Kloster Hummel from the railway and transport association.\n They have a guideline that says that members of the AfD are not allowed to be members.\n Is that the case with you?\n Honestly, I don't know. But I'm sure that someone who actively represents people's position as people of interest,\n who represents racist positions, can be excluded.\n This has happened in the past.\n I am a political referent in a political team.\n I am a lobbyist,\n because I don't work in the membership\n or the membership administration.\n And I am not 100% sure.\n If you ask me about specific names or cases,\n I can't tell you.\n Who do you personally support?\n For what exactly? That AFD members can't participate in Amnesty International.\n I think that the AFD represents positions that are completely unequaled with those of Amnesty International.\n For example, when it comes to the rights of refugees, when it comes to the fight against racism, when it comes to the rights of women, for example.\n And whoever represents that actively could not be active at Amnesty International.\n Why are you active? Why did you join us?\n I think since 2013 or 14, which is about the same. I have actually been funding Amnesty\n for a long time financially. I've been doing that for a very, very long time. I still do that.\n I'm basically giving back part of my salary. I can then still live off the rest.\n And I actually became a member when I started working at Amnesty.\n But that wasn't a prerequisite?\n That wasn't a prerequisite, no.\n At the time when I started working at Amnesty, I did support financially, but they didn't know that.\n I didn't say that in the advertising interview, it wasn't asked.\n And then I became a member shortly afterwards, because it turned out to be consistent.\n Why did you apply to Amnesty?\n I wanted to go into civil society. I have always been engaged in various things before, especially in the field of network politics.\n And that was an area that was newly built at Amnesty when I came to Amnesty in 2014, also built up as a reaction to Edward Snowden's discovery.\n I came from university, studied philosophy in my major,\n which was also a great study, which I would do again and again,\n only that I would do it with other subjects.\n And I wanted to become a little more practical now.\n I did philosophy with a focus focused on philosophy and ethics.\n It's a lot about the history of human rights, for example the idea of human rights,\n about questions of distributional justice and the like.\n But that doesn't necessarily become practical.",
      "And that means we have regional representatives in our politics team,\n who then, for example, take care of the sub-Saharan Africa or the Americas or Asia or Europe Central,\n care for Africa and the MENA region.\n And then we have theme referents like me.\n And I'm then so active in the topics that I have described.\n I'm just doing the TRIPS stories.\n I also do the surveillance, the targeted surveillance, the trade with surveillance technology, a little bit of arms export control.\n But we also have a very strong agency, I said that.\n We have over 600 members who are organized in groups.\n Now your boss is probably watching, do you need more help from you?\n They would like to give me more help, but we are a donation-funded organization.\n We need more money.\n We need more donors, of course, always.\n We put a maximum of 30 need a donor, of course, always. We put in\n a maximum of 30 percent of our money into staff, the rest goes into our work and the campaigns.\n And that simply means that it is covered a bit. Of course it would be nice if there were more people.\n Have you ever asked if you can have someone? Can you now ...\n That went to the unfavorable ...\n A viewer who says now, I want to do a internship with Lena. Does that work?\n That works, yes. But we have just given up the next slots for this year, but in principle you can apply for internships at amnesty.de. Yes, that works.\n I'm surprised that you're there alone. We are the team in the headquarters and I have a theme coordination group.\n I don't have the theme coordination group. There are a number of committed members who have joined a theme coordination group, for example arms export control.\n There is a theme coordination group with great experts for human rights in the digital age. I work with them and our members also do independent lobbying work.\n They are also involved in the development of campaigns.\n They also write the classic letters for prisoners.\n And there is already a very, very important part of our work.\n In this respect, I am not alone in the sense, even if I am the only main office.\n Why do you only spend 30 percent of your staff? Where does the other money flow?\n In campaign material, for example, our actions, that costs a lot of money.\n The support of the members, who of course also need a budget if they want to do a stand, do a public action, develop something.\n You could say, we're doing 30-40% of it, can you do that?\n Yes, that's a collective decision. Our membership is chosen by a board of directors, they have regular annual meetings where they determine the direction of the movement.\n And that's where it's discussed again and again. And so far it was the, the decision was to stay with this staff.\n It's a difficult decision for every organization.\n I wouldn't say that something useful happens with every euro.\n And if there is more staff, you are less involved in something else.\n It's always difficult.\n We are funded through donations. We don't receive government funds or anything like that.\n Are you a common benefit or did you already get fired? We are an by donations, we don't receive government money or anything like that. Are you a common benefit or did you already get recognized?\n We are an integrated association.\n Common benefit?\n So you can get a tax refund if you donate?\n Yes, you can. Oh, you mean because it was recognized as an attack and also came back that it was given away.\n We are part of this alliance of civil society that says that the right to common benefit must be reformed.\n But we are primarily in solidarity with the organizations that have met this goal.\n And since we are active in human rights work and also in human rights education,\n we also make, for example, teaching suggestions for teachers to inform about human rights and the history of human rights.\n The letter marathon at schools, where students write to help people who are in prison.\n We also do a lot of human rights education and the like.\n We are probably not threatened by the recognition of our common interest.\n We are there in solidarity with the other organizations.\n We started with the surveillance capitalists, we talked about that.\n Google, Facebook, whatever you demand.\n We have already done other broadcasts about it, but you also deal with the export and production of surveillance technologies."

I mean, you know what the South Yemen is.\n South Yemen was something like East and West Germany. So I am a Northlander, so I come from the North Yemen.\n And there is the South Yemen.

How was that?\n The other way around. The first one was right. I'm German, I was born in Yemen, I grew up here, I went to school here, I have a said to myself, until I improve my situation,\n and then I said, now that people are in dialogue, now you can do something in Yemen.\n Build something. Exactly. I run a factory for disinfectants.\n We supply hospitals, cleaning companies, etc.\n The company is running, but as I said, then something came up that you didn't expect.\n Maybe my decision was also young and naive.\n Tell me, if your family is already outside, why aren't you outside?\n Why isn't the foreign office helping you?\n There is also a German embassy in Jemen.\n There was once.\n There was once.\n I have to tell you honestly, I really have to thank the Executive Office for this.\n You really feel the state's concern in Germany, but I feel it more intensely here in Germany.

    "response": "\nThe European Union is working on implementing the Digital Markets Act, which aims to regulate the behavior of large platforms such as Amazon. This regulation would set rules on how Amazon interacts with other providers on its platform, focusing on fairness and transparency. Additionally, the EU is discussing potential changes to taxation policies regarding e-commerce. The idea is to shift taxation towards the location where the products are delivered, rather than the business headquarters. This would ensure that the tax burden is shared more fairly among businesses operating within the EU.",
    "contexts": [
      "That's why it's important that you still have someone who looks at it\n and then says from a certain point on, now we interrupt the trade.\n But that also happens. In order to link to this, Radioactive Stardust again. Amazon's business model works\n particularly well because it works to become a monopoly. Do you have to stop this development?\n Do you have to force more competition through the state? And if so, how does that work?\n Yes, you need more competition and that has to happen through regulation.\n And that happens or will hopefully happen even more strongly now\n through something like the Digital Markets Act.\n This is the European design for more regulation of such large platforms,\n Amazon as such a platform.\n This would then set up rules on how Amazon behaves on this platform,\n how it deals with other providers on this platform.\n It's about self-reliance, under what conditions do you let others act on the platform, what kind of requirements do you set for them.\n All of this should and must be regulated.\n And that's more than white silk? That will actually affect a lot. I'm going to leave that out.\n To add to that, Phil Bronco, e-commerce. Should the taxation be bound to the place of purchase, for example, in order to counteract tax ev losses in the municipalities? At the place of purchase.\n Yes, so if e-commerce, i.e. if online orders are made,\n the individual dealer has income losses on site,\n the taxation of the income or profits of e-commerce\n should be realized there, where the product is ultimately delivered.\n That's interesting because it's a very similar question to how we deal with tax internationally,\n i.e. with the big digital companies. So far we have the principle that the tax is paid where the\n business district is and not where the income is generated. That's why we get the taxes from our automobile companies.\n Even if they sell cars in China, if we tied it to the sales location now,\n then we wouldn't have this income anymore. That's why Germany has\n had a hard time turning around there so far. But in fact that's ...\n But that's a different situation with e-commerce. Because what is delivered online is a real choice for the seller on site who would otherwise have delivered this product.\n That's right. The question is, this would require that the law is adjusted accordingly. In the international area, I have already pointed out\n why Germany was so reserved so far,\n because tax revenues would then fall out of certain areas.\n But now in the EU, they have agreed that,\n not only in the EU, but also in the rest of the world,\n that we should go in this direction,\n that we should actually include a part of the revenue\n on the location where the revenue is generated.\n And the same could be done here at e-commerce.\n In Germany I have not yet seen that this is discussed in that sense,\n but it would be worth considering. I would not exclude that.\n Enlirat, what to do against too big to fail? Corporations like VW, Lufthansa, banks are saved\n because it would obviously be seen as a catastrophe a catastrophe if they go bankrupt.\n On the other hand, there have been bankruptcies before.\n If banks are gambling, why does the taxpayer have to pay for it?\n Yes, because the companies are obviously so big that you are afraid,\n worried that the bigger even if they are very large companies. In the banking sector, you are always worried that systemic risks will follow.\n If one bank is bankrupt, then others will also suffer.\n With large companies, it is always about the topic of how it is with the jobs.\n If too many people suddenly become worried that they will lose their jobs,\n that is a big problem. And I think you have to make sure that even if it comes to such a great misery,\n which does not mean that everyone will be on the street for eternity afterwards.\n Was it wrong that in the pandemic the state bought or took over Lufthansa shares?\n That's a concrete example.\n You shouldn't have done that?\n No, at this point I think it was actually useful.\n But now again, at this point it's not about\n simply saving jobs.\n I still had an overarching goal.\n The company could have been bought.\n So, let's say Lufthansa went bankrupt, then another company, another airline from another country would have taken over.\n What would have been the problem?\n The problem would have been that,\n as a precaution, the hubs that we have lost in Germany.",
      "Or it doesn't work.\n Then there are of course the cases where the individual does not want to have any performance at all,\n because it is purely capital payments.\n Then you have to try to avoid this through the appropriate tax agreements with other countries, double taxation agreements and so on.\n You can't completely avoid it, but at least that you completely exploit it, that it is not done.\n For example, there was a discussion at the moment with the big international societies whether they pay enough taxes in Germany. That's the American way of doing it, if they have McDonald's or Starbucks or Amazon.\n That also depends on our tax laws, and there is a thought in Europe at the moment,\n to get through a certain harmonization and also minimum regulation,\n that then also the companies that are active are also paying taxes in Germany.\n It can't be that if I buy a book on Amazon, there is hardly any tax left,\n but the bookseller around the corner of course has to pay the German tax.\n Of course, you have to see that competition is also prevailing\n and that's certainly one way or another to improve.\n But how can it be that I order a book on Amazon and have to pay the income in Luxembourg?\n Why doesn't it apply when I order at Amazon in Germany as a German,\n that they also pay the taxes in Germany?\n Yes, because they don't order at Amazon Germany, but at Amazon Luxembourg. And then, first of all, the value creation in Luxembourg\n occurs. Then there are other constructions. I can build subsidiaries,\n subsidiaries in low-income countries. This society does not give\n the German subsidiary the German daughter society,\n capital of its own, but also foreign capital for financing activities.\n You had to make it a little simpler.\n Foreign capital means, it does not give money as capital, but as credit.\n And you pay interest on credit.\n That means, for the German company, that's the cost. Reduce the profit. For the company that for the German companies that's the cost, reduce the profit.\n For the company that gives the credit, that's the income. That means in this way I can...\n Even though it's the same company?\n Yes, I have two different companies. The subsidiaries, they make contracts with each other.\n And for example with financing, they don't do it like a German who is a company, he has to bring in his own money first, then he takes on additional credit.\n The interest on the credit of the bank can of course be deducted, but what sometimes let the tax fall somewhere else, of course in areas where it is low.\n Or the other is, I give licenses. So I'm a car company and sometimes give\n for the production, in a certain country a car is produced. Then you have to have\n certain patents for it. And you give them.\n In the country where the cars are produced, the costs are reduced.\n So far the profit and the tax.\n And then I have to have the license fees applied where the taxes are low.\n For example in one of these exotic tax paradises.\n Why is it still there? Why is it possible in the EU that Malta, Luxembourg and all the small countries can still do it?\n In the EU, they try to reduce it through minimum taxation.\n They try? Yes, it is a thing, but there are still certain constructions and countries that can also cause considerable tax reductions for the individual. different taxes in England themselves. Namely in England and then for example on the\n Channel Islands. So they have their own tax parties in their own country. That means\n even an Englishman can make use of it and so far a European can do it. Similar\n other types of construction, but with the same result, for example, in the Netherlands.\n That's always the attempt of the individual countries to improve at the expense of others.\n Only if everyone does that, they all stand bad.\n It's like in the cinema. Someone stands up to see better. When everyone stands up, the effect is gone, but everyone is not comfortable anymore, but is uncomfortable.\n That's what you often have in the international area. And of course you have to try to make agreements.\n And the same problem is not only with the Germans. All the big ones, the French, partly the Americans,\n and we are now trying, but it's difficult,\n to make it impossible to do things like that through certain agreements between the countries."

      "They didn't do that. They didn't do that, but they still have the possibility to take on biometric surveillance, if they want to.\n Another limited progress of the reform of this export regime for surveillance technology was was that there is a European list. I just said that until now...\n The watch list?\n Exactly, right.\n Until now, Europe simply exported the list from the Vassna agreement.\n That means Europe could only control export things\n that Russia and Turkey want to control.\n Because, as I said, it can't be that Europe can't grow beyond that\n and can say, we also take our own list of goods and say,\n we in the European Union want to control biometric surveillance systems beyond that.\n And there is such a list now, but it is not binding and it is not yet clear what will be on it.\n It has a declaratory character.\n Yes, that's funny. So when it comes to problematic goods and problematic recipient countries, where it should land, then it's always negotiable.\n They are not binding, so no state has to stick to it.\n It's a consensus list, everyone has to agree on that. Then they explain that they want it, but it manufacturer from Germany or France, no, we don't want it, then it will fly out.\n Then it will fly out?\n Then it will fly out of the list.\n Yes, of course, a single EU city can file a veto. That is the problem with consensus. On the other hand, you can get more states to agree to a solution like that.\n That's the disadvantage of consensus.\n What kind of watch list is that?\n We have made ourselves very strong for a strong binding list that has a majority decision behind it.\n Where even a single state, which has a particularly strong economic interest here can be decided what has not happened is what has not happened and effectively we have\n a very very very very very very weak effectively we have still received a very gaping reform\n that's true although you have to say that germany there that was then finally\n signed under the german council presidency and that was before that has been\n pulled over years that was unbelievable how long this reform has\n gone and the German Presidency was then at least\n something was said, which was a progress, even if it was far behind\n what was originally the EU Commission and the\n EU Parliament both suggested and we also supported.\n Is there anything that definitely not from Europe on\n surveillance technology can be exported anywhere in the world, not from Europe, by surveillance technology?\n So, somewhere in the world, not really.\n You could of course also export something within Europe, but that wouldn't be possible.\n But outside of Europe.\n Is there something that doesn't go to Egypt, not in favor of China. There are things like these classic Trojans, which are definitely\n authoritative of approval. But whether the approval is granted is a question of the national\n challenge. Do we know if approvals have not been granted in terms of Trojans?\n We know that since 2015 the federal government has no more approvals for Trojans\n according to its own statement . That was introduced by Sigmar Gabriel at the time.\n And there were obviously exports, but that's why NGOs were against a criminal complaint against Fynn Fischer.\n Could Fynn Fischer just found a subsidiary in another European country and then...\n There are probably Fynn Fischer subsidiaries, unfortunately.\n And that's something that might come out in the context of the investigation of the state prosecutor's office after this criminal report, whether it has been done via subsidiaries.\n Why is it even legal to have a company with which I develop surveillance technology and thus sell this technology to states, to dictatorships, to sell them, which then suppress their population.\n Is the position that there should not be this kind of product production?\n Or why is it legal to sell it to these countries that use it to suppress the population?\n Against the latter, we have really been very active for years now,\n with progress, but limited progress.\n The EU also describes human rights. We also have a human rights convention and so on.\n How can it be that it is possible that we sell regimes protective equipment so that they suppress their population?\n Or protect themselves from their population. There was the so-called 9 countries paper of 9 EU states, Germany wasn't one of them,\n who opposed this reform and said it should remain as lax as possible, the export control.\n There were countries, of which you wouldn't have thought it, the Scandinavian countries for example,\n because they have a strong IT technology economy.",
      "They have relatively small amounts of cut-off.\n And that leads to the fact that, for example, biometric surveillance, such as face recognition technology, is not even particularly acceptable.\n That means that the European Union, when it is implemented, human rights do not play a role.\n And so they can end up in Xinjiang.\n I had written down at EU Dual Use that manufacturers must first check themselves\n whether their products, such as this facial recognition software, can violate human rights.\n And only when it is clear that it violates human rights,\n then they have to show it. If it is only possible or even likely, then they don't have to.\n That is listed. That means you look to see if your product is on the list. There are categories\n of products on it and you look to see if one falls below that. And that's maybe what you mean\n with checking yourself first.\n You have to see if your product is on the checked list.\n What hasn't happened so far is that you have to look beyond that.\n Okay, I have a good one here, it's not on the list.\n It's face recognition technology.\n Great, it's not on the list.\n I want to export it to China.\n Hmm, maybe not such a good idea. I'll take a look at the human rights law in China. I'll take a look at Amnesty's annual report, for example, at how the human rights law in China is and how technology is used there.\n And if I see a risk, I'll turn to BAFA, the Federal Office for Economic and Exchange Control,\n and ask for a test and a permit, even if I'm not actually on the list with this product. This is a standalone due diligence test that has not been provided before,\n for which we have done a lot of work and where we have also made a certain success.\n The EU-Dulius-Order has been reformed and now there is such a due diligence test.\n And that it also applies to the definitions of surveillance technology,\n that it is only about hidden surveillance technologies and not open ones?\n Yes, we had a lot of conversations about that.\n We were very much committed to the fact that this word, covered, is used.\n Why did they include it?\n The official argument is that it would otherwise be too difficult to distinguish, for example,\n the facial recognition of your cell phone.\n You are still able to export cell phones with a face that automatically distracts you when you look inside,\n without having to make an application at the Wafaa every time.\n We were of the opinion that it is very easy to distinguish between the identifying and verifying facial recognition technology.\n One is the one that just checks if you are it.\n And the other one answers the question,\n is this the person she is pretending to be?\n And the image I have saved here,\n and it is looking for this single match\n and the identifying facial recognition technology.\n That's where you put a camera on the street\n and it scans all people\n and tries to find out who these people are.\n And the camera is an open surveillance measure?\n Exactly, that's why we used it.\n It doesn't fall down?\n So that's a typical job we do.\n Besides writing letters, we also look at these legal texts and say, hey, there's a cover in here.\n And then we did research.\n We published this report, said European companies are delivering face recognition technology to Xinjiang.\n There we see massive human rights problems and risks. We have covered this report here, please spell the word, so that also visible surveillance technology is basically authoritative.\n They didn't do that. They didn't do that, but they still have the possibility to take on biometric surveillance, if they want to.\n Another limited progress of the reform of this export regime for surveillance technology was was that there is a European list. I just said that until now...\n The watch list?\n Exactly, right.\n Until now, Europe simply exported the list from the Vassna agreement.\n That means Europe could only control export things\n that Russia and Turkey want to control.\n Because, as I said, it can't be that Europe can't grow beyond that\n and can say, we also take our own list of goods and say,\n we in the European Union want to control biometric surveillance systems beyond that.\n And there is such a list now, but it is not binding and it is not yet clear what will be on it.\n It has a declaratory character.\n Yes, that's funny."

    "response": "\nThe political circumstances and contexts preventing Jewish and Palestinian people from having common rights in the Middle East involve complex issues related to power dynamics, historical conflicts, and the ongoing struggle for recognition and coexistence. These factors include the existence of the Israeli national state, the presence of different religious and cultural identities, and the various political factions within each community. Additionally, the lack of control over resources and infrastructure, such as access to clean water, further exacerbates the challenges faced by both communities. Ultimately, achieving a peaceful resolution requires addressing these underlying issues and fostering mutual understanding and respect among all parties involved.",

      "Is there a potential in such a successful little attempt that you can say from below that something is happening?\n No.\n No?\n No.\n Why not?\n Because we are all human. The problem is not that Jewish,\n Israeli people and Palestinian people cannot play together in an orchestra per se.\n That's just not the problem. The problem is that there are political circumstances and contexts that make certain people in this country not have certain basic rights.\n And then it doesn't make sense to play the violin together.\n Yes, but now I take the orchestra as a real, as a real existing space of action. In this orchestra they have,\n at the level where they are, common rights.\n So, if I now, and I'm really the utopian now,\n can I imagine, or can you imagine,\n that there are projects in the region where Jewish and Palestinian people are together on the same level?\n And is that not sustainable?\n I think it's funny that we both speak of equal rights for everyone in the country\n and maybe it's connected to the fact that we're both from Haifa.\n There are such projects, especially in Haifa right now.\n But I'll go back to this conversation and say, okay, this orchestra, that happened again in Berlin.\n That happened again in a place where none of these groups had more rights than the others.\n And I conclude that it could theoretically happen in a utopian Middle East, it could happen. But for that, a situation must be created\n where none of these two groups has more rights than the others. And that cannot happen\n through an Israeli national state, a Jewish national city,\n would not have happened through a Palestinian national city.\n But, yes.\n Jewish and Muslim people also lived peacefully together in this country.\n There are enough stories, and when you talk to the older generations,\n they tell you stories.\n There is this family of Abouaiche in Hebron, I don't know if you know the story, Thilo,\n who had a laban, a yoghurt factory together.\n So Jewish and, well, no, there wasn't Israel back then, Jewish and Muslim Palestinians\n or whatever.\n They had this yoghurt factory together and worked seven days a week.\n The Jews could work on Fridays, the Muslims could work on Saturdays.\n They worked together and there are many such stories that I also heard when I lived there.\n It certainly wasn't all perfect either.\n But the problem is not because you can't be together for genetic reasons.\n I've seen people in many places in West Jordan and Israel who lived and worked together.\n My cousin is Palestinian, her best friend is Jewish.\n I can give you a thousand examples.\n But even if you have a project together in West-Jordanland,\n then in the end the Palestinian child goes back to his refugee camp\n and has no control over the water that comes out of the tap\n and whether water comes out or not.\n And the Jewish-Israeli child goes back to his city.\n The political context and the circumstances do not allow this at the moment.\n There should be a change of context.\n But the first problem is that we are not allowed to talk about it.\n And I don't know if we should do it or not.\n And the second problem is that when you think realistically about political power interests,\n it is simply not wanted.\n So there are contradictions on all sides.\n And actually, you say it has to come from the outside.\n Theoretically, people on site would probably have to fight for it.\n But with the situation as it is now, where actually all sides are retreating and radicalizing in their own way,\n that has also gone a long way off.\n That's why I can't just allow you to try to get out with a cool idea in this podcast or show.\n No, no, that's not it.\n I just have to think about what Hans said. I once had Dan Schifftan, he is an Israeli security adviser, Hans would now call him a man from Disneyland.\n I understand him too.\n I understand that too, but the reality is the language of violence and the even though the Israeli democracy has been thrown under the bus in the name of the Zionist Israeli project.\n And when you say that people have to fight for it, to live this way and this...\n To fight for the impossible. This fateful future, exactly. It goes beyond that, at least before October 7th, that the state, or rather the government, would rather give up its democratic foundations It's still the same government and they're still taking these steps.",
      "But we are now where we are and we have this piece of land and we have 7 million Jewish Israelis\n and 7 million Palestinian people who live together in the smallest space.\n Partly also live together, work together, I don't want to romanticize it, the fronts are hardened, but of course there is that.\n So my family is Palestinian, for example, my uncle is a lawyer in Jaffa, most of his clients are Jewish Israelis.\n My other uncle here is a doctor in the Heifer hospital, Rambam. His patients and colleagues are mostly Jewish Israelis.\n And you can talk to each other, you can work together, that doesn't change the structural problems, but I want to say that there are more grey tones than you can imagine here.\n And I am deeply convinced that there is a solution that can only be given together for everyone. I don't know what it looks like, but the fact is, if Lebanon or Iran were to seriously interfere in this conflict or war, then everyone would be involved.\n Then Palestinian and Jewish people would go to the bottom together. There can only be a common solution. You can't separate people from each other. And I think this very shortened view of Germany,\n always, this is now the Israeli, I mean your thumbnail,\n I'm in front of a Palestinian flag and you're in front of an Israeli flag,\n that's nice, but of course I don't represent all Palestinian people\n and I don't speak for everyone, because Palestinian people\n also have very diverse opinions, religions, ideologies, etc.\n just like Jewish Israelis.\n And it's super dangerous that, as it often happens in Germany,\n people look at it very briefly as if there is this one Palestinian and this one Israeli perspective\n and as if everything that would deviate from it in the discourse in any form means a great danger.\n That's why I emphasized at the beginning that you are one Palestinian perspective, just like Tomer.\n Exactly, that was not an attack against the thumbnail.\n No, no, no, that's independent of the thumbnail. There are hundreds of perspectives and you can't depict all of them. But in the discourse, at least here in Germany, there are far too few perspectives.\n And that's why it was our concern to do this show.\n I think I just wanted to say something. I think that the core of the conflict is recognition. So this conflict is not really, as I see it, it is not really about, in any case,\n not about religion and it is also not even about land. It is about recognition. It is about the fact that\n both sides or both sides feel that they do not recognize the right to exist on the other side in this country.\n And the question is, you say, a solution for everyone in this country.\n Exactly, the question is, what does it look like if they recognize each other as people who are allowed to live in this country,\n are allowed to live freely, what should it look like? The question is, is that even wanted? And that is\n another point. Both in Germany and in Israel I often had the feeling\n that it was not at all intentional that people find each other.\n So I lived in West Jordan for three years and was there a lot on the road.\n And I was among other things a lot in Masar Faryatah, which is south of Hebron.\n This is a region where there are a lot of Palestinian villages that are still very still very easy to live in, sometimes in caves.\n There are many radical settlers who attack these villages every day.\n And the Palestinians there are completely defenseless. They have no police children and the children have to pass by the settlements.\n And it often came to situations where settlers attacked these children on the way to school.\n Some of them were international observers, which led to the children being accompanied by the Israeli military to school so that settlers cannot attack them.\n What I want to add is that in this place, Masar Faryata, every morning, or probably not at the moment, but were until October 7th,\n a group of activists every morning, including especially Jewish activists and Jewish Israelis who have divided up and went there in the morning to accompany these Palestinian children and to function also captured by the Israeli army.\n They were insanely attacked.\n And by the way, one of the group was killed in the Hamas attack.\n But I always had the feeling that these encounters that take place,\n and there are also Palestinian people and Jewish-Israeli people who work together for Palestinian rights,\n that this is actually not intended at all.\n Who doesn't want it?"

He plays a character who questions things, sometimes pretending to have certainty about what he doesn't have.

Of course I always say things that I wouldn't normally say.\n I play a confusion that I don't have or I play knowing exactly what I don't have.\n But these are individual parts. Actually the character is pretty close to me.\n Is she an educational character? Is she a fun-loving character? An entertainment character? A critic of the relationship, of the power?\n Yes, now you've put it all together nicely.\n All at once?\n Yes, of course. No, first of all she's a deconstructing character. She She questions. That's all I do. I question.\n It's always difficult when I'm asked for solutions, because I question my own solutions. That's my character.\n Of course, if you ask me about certain decisions that I would have to make, that's why I would be completely unsuitable as a politician because I would constantly question my own decisions.\n And out of insecurity, you often do that with a joke. That's clear.\n Yes, we said that earlier. You like to criticize the other's solutions, but you probably also know solutions that you like.\n Do you make a joke about that? Oh, yes. That's so, so, so, I don't know, I don't know.\n I do, I, I, I see my task in questioning.\n Yes. And that's how you want to clarify.\n And that is, questioning is, in my opinion, an essential part of the clarification.\n What do you explain? That's another question about math.\n That's a great question.\n No, it's a question about what you explain. I've been working on stage for 30 years and I've explained everything.\n I could additively put these topics together. You also like to talk about Popper and Kant.\n Kant said that enlightenment is the liberation of the human from his self-indulgent immaturity.\n How do you do that?\n I think it's public reflection and not coming to the result.\n I don't think thinking ever gets to the result.\n If you're a politician you have to get to the result.\n At some point there's a vote and then it's decided yes or no.\n And I often feel that everything that is yes or no is often insufficient.\n That's a principle in my character. Everything that is clear, there are no arguments, there is something missing.\n And that's how it is. Most problems are not black and white, most problems are in grey tones.\n And then they are evaluated differently from one another than from the other.\n And then you are in such a...\n That's when it actually starts to become enlightening.\n Where you recognize contradictions, recognize dilemmas, it starts to get interesting.\n And that's the opposite of politics, where you have to make a decision.\n That's the beauty of humor, that you don't have to be determined in what you do.\n That you don't let everything be guided by a commanding function that you have to practice.\n I don't have to do that.\n I can change everything from today to tomorrow.\n I can think of something else tomorrow.\n That's one of the things that I find very sad\n to deal with criticism in this culture today.\n That things are always being held up to you that you said five years ago, where you criticism today, that you are always being told the things you said five years ago,\n where you are today, where you say today,\n no, I wouldn't say that anymore,\n or today I see it much more clearly.\n Let's talk about it.\n That you are constantly forced to defend yourself\n for things you have already removed yourself from.\n to defend yourself for things that you have already removed yourself from, that the error is no longer possible without losing face, I think that's a shame that you can't\n just say, oh yes, I see things differently today. And I actually do that all the time. I actually see things\n all the time differently than three years ago. Who is your audience? I don't know. My audience is incredibly broad. Stolen?\n No, not stolen. I mean, broad-minded.\n You can watch your show on stolen.\n Maybe it helps.\n I don't know.\n Maybe it helps to watch stolen.

      "What should I argue against or what is expected?\n I mean, that's not what I do.\n The fact is that if this family, for example,\n has spent money in this month to buy food,\n that it will be difficult to keep the budget in the next month,\n because food has to be bought next month.\n And that the distribution struggles that are related to the resource consumption worldwide are difficult to handle and difficult to control.\n And that, with the very common example of a family that spends too little money, the situation becomes a little too simple.\n That has too little money.\n That has too little money or spends more money than she has.\n That's what others think.\n That you make yourself a bit too easy with this picture.\n Because you simplify the super complex distribution struggles that come with the global distribution of resources so much if they were easy to solve.\n And they are not.\n There was a question, because you said it more often\n and pointed out the complexity of the relationship,\n but the way Dieter takes this as an excuse\n and makes himself funny about everything,\n or makes himself fun of everything, that enables people, who are in the complex relationships as they are,\n to laugh and say, well, on with it.\n I don't think that's the case.

It is what makes people in the crowd so incredibly suspicious to me.\n Namely that he rots together, swings up and down, escalating each other and then is able to do things that are absolutely inhumane.\n And that's how I explained it.\n I made it clear exactly in what context I see it.\n I even said in the original context that I don't want to compare it.\n That then of course this first part is torn out is clear,\n that has something to do with the fact that you like to label,\n evaluate, exclude the other-thinker, evaluate, exclude from the discussion.\n And that happened so prototypically there, as in hardly any other place.\n There is never a comparison between Shitstorm and the Third Reich.\n It never existed and it was torn out like that.\n That's a typical case, by the way, that I'm right with what I'm saying.\n That the human being, in his co-existence, is removed from the truth and tends to destroy the enemy."

This allowed the minister to have a wide range of powers, which could have been revoked by the parliament at any time.

    "contexts": [
      "But in retrospect, you always just...\n No, in the beginning we really, that's true, we gave the health minister the competence by the authority of the constitution at the very beginning, because we didn't know if we could still hold it.\n It was a phase where we gave the full power to the minister, a very wide-ranging full power,\n which we could have withdrawn at any time as a parliament. The clause was also included.\n So in this respect, we once decided as a parliament that we would give them this authority.\n The legislator already said that. It didn't just come about like that, the parliament decided that.\n And that was right at the beginning, that's why I know that so well,\n because I was there myself, because we didn't know if we could still hold it.\n Now you have to say afterwards, thank God, the parliament has always been able to hold it,\n even with distance and masks and vaccination and the stands.\n We all know the pictures.\n I don't think that was that easy for the parliament.\n And then we also discussed the pandemic in parliament.\n The impression was at the beginning that we made a lot of regulations\n or gave the power of regulation to the minister and the countries.\n But that was based on the old infection protection law.\n And I said back then, we have to get there. When the pandemic is over, we have to get to this infection protection law,\n in order to be able to give the federal government competences in such matters.\n And in the end it was the case that we gradually took back the competences of the regulation.\n That was only not registered in the public.\n So in that respect it is not true. It was the impression at the beginning\n that the government and the countries\n are the only ones that are president.\n I wanted to reflect on the impression.\n Yes, it was like that.\n But the truth is, we had\n day and night, video calls\n and then we debated the laws\n and decided that we would take it out\n as a competence.\n The minister didn't decide that alone anymore, when we knew we could talk with distance and so on.\n The Bundestag also talked all the time.\n I learned in school, about the Bundestag, parliament.\n It's the high house, probably the most important institution in our country.\n You are the legislator.\n But I've been working as a journalist for ten years now.\n Somehow it seems to me that in the end the federal government will give you the laws.\n And then the parliament can change them a little bit, which is also called strict, no law reaches the Bundestag as it goes out.\n But in the big picture most of the laws come from the federal government, which is actually the executive.\n Yes.\n Is the impression also wrong?\n No, that's also the case.\n But that's because we really have a system with a coalition agreement, that there are coalition-supporting factions.\n The coalition agreement is not in the constitution.\n No.\n That's all voluntary.\n No, of course, every single member of parliament could not have taken it.\n They could introduce a bill.\n The faction can also introduce one. No, of course every single member of parliament could not have taken it. They could have introduced a bill. Even the parliamentary party could have introduced it.\n But of course you say, we are the government, we have a coalition agreement, the ministers, the ministers have their houses, they prepare a bill.\n And of course it is ideally discussed with the representatives a bit, what should go into it.\n And then it is assigned to the parliament.\n And then we come into play as parliaments.\n But a coalition agreement could also mean, okay, from the coalition ...\n Yes, I say ...\n The members of the coalition think the law looks like this and the government has to execute it.\n Yes, of course, that is also decided.\n It is not taken.\n If the faction says ...\n But it happens so rarely, right?\n Rarely.\n That is the truth, it happens rarely. But the good thing is, the truth is that we can change a lot in parliamentary proceedings.\n And that is often underestimated.\n The first draft, when you see a development, which we want to make possible digitally,\n that you can see what has actually changed from the first draft to the signing has actually changed. We want to work on this transparent legislation,\n so that it will be understandable to everyone digitally at some point.\n Now we are back at the Bundestag.

That's why I'm going to talk to the Saxon Prime Minister\n afterwards to make a phone call to get an overview of what exactly the situation is there.\n What can you do there?\n We have concepts developed between the federal government and the countries, also regarding the transplantation of patients across the federal government.\n One is where to go, how to coordinate. The second is what to transplant with, so helicopters or vehicles or something else.\n And we have to talk to each other now, whether there in the cooperation then now has to be switched live, so to speak, also nationwide.\n That would be the first time then the case.\n Is the goal that there is no triage? That it was the only time now, if that's what it takes. We don't know yet whether it was what was described there.\n Our goal is of course to avoid such a situation in the German health care system, to avoid an overload.\n That has been the main goal of our strategy since spring, not because we absolutely set health care.\n He is not, but he is very heavily weighted.\n The problem in this pandemic, in this situation, is that no matter what we decide or not decide, damage is caused.\n There is health damage if we don't decide anything, if the number of infections simply increases.\n We see this very sadly, especially now on the intensive care units.\n There is economic damage for many in gastronomy, in retail, in different areas or individually. Unemployment, short-time work, social hardships.\n And in the end it's about weighing the weight.\n Where is damage more easily bearable, where can we make it more bearable?\n For example through economic aid.\n But of course, especially with death and health care,\n making it bearable is no longer possible.\n And that's why we said that weighting is more important.\n The health care system should not be overloaded. but it has been overloaded for months now.\n It's going on high tours. How long can that only go well?\n It is overloaded, it is very heavily burdened, regionally very heavily,\n Saxony for example, Saarland currently too. That's why it is so important that today the\n additional measures, restrictions, contact reduction, not only come into force, it's not just about some kind of regulation, but it's also about our shared responsibility as citizens to adapt to each other.\n The numbers simply cannot increase much further on the intensive care stations. The nurses, the doctors, all the others who are involved there are really in an enormous burden, both time-wise and physically and mentally.\n But how long can they do that?\n The less time we make them necessary, the better. I can't name a week now, if that until the intensive care unit is full, then we make measures.\n Infection rates are not so important, so some people's approach was slightly simplified.\n Never quite understood, because of course every intensive care patient is also suffering first.\n So first of all the patient who suffers, the relatives who are unsure what is happening, the consequences,\n which can not be left out of a breathing and the care workers who are under stress.\n And that's why our goal is not to keep the intensive care units manageable,\n but ideally to have them free and empty from COVID-19 patients who are not sick at all.\n The problem with the intensive care units at the moment is not that there are many intensive beds,\n but that there are many people who can take care of the people there.\n Yes, the topic of Corona is like a firework for many topics that were already there before.\n And the lack of staff in healthcare is something that has been bothering us for a long time.\n It is also one of the main topics for me as a health minister for two and a half years, where we have created additional positions, financed them."

We can agree on that.\n We should complain to the sun. We can agree on that.\n And you have to say, we really were young and naive at 18. That's not advertising.\n So, a new episode of Jung & Naiv. I have a new guest.\n You've been with me quite often, but you've never been on a show here at Jung & Naiv. Who are you?\n I'm Luisa Neubauer.\n What do you do?\n I'm a climate activist, among other things.\n What does that mean exactly?\n Climate activists find out that we are in an existential climate crisis and do something about it.\n What do you do?\n I go to the streets with Fridays for Future, but I also do a few other things to get people's attention about the ecological collapse and encourage people to do the same.\n And is it a job?\n No, but maybe it will be.\n Do you have a job?\n I'm a student.\n Still? Have just signed up? Thilo, yes. I'm still in the master's program.\n I'm still studying. I started this summer semester and I I have now already laid down my seminar this morning and\n honestly enjoy it totally because it is so exciting that I study geography and in the master's I do\n a little more specialized things with resource management and that sounds so stupid\n but for me it is really the greatest gift that I can sit down and look at all these interesting\n things and that in addition to the other stuff I do. You had a lecture today?\n Exactly, this morning, seminar.\n What was it about?\n Oh, good that you ask. It's a new subject.\n And we've already learned it.\n A new subject. In the end, we deal with the social science side of the climate crisis.\n And that is totally important, because the climate crisis is often discussed only as a physical problem.\n And the social, psychological and social components of it are hardly discussed and are much less given to the people.\n And that's why it should be in this subject.\n But what does that have to do with geography?\n Well, geography looks at the interaction of the earth systems with the societies.\n And that means we look at human-nature relations in concrete terms and the spaces in which there is interaction between humans and nature, between people, between natural systems, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, nature, etc. And we, in geography, but especially I, we look at what this has to do with social implications.\n We find that in the years when there were major climate extremes,\n for example in the Enilio event in the Pacific, there were in most cases economic crises, conflicts, also armed conflicts.\n Because the climate systems, they are over-strapacing what we as social societies can often\n withstand, can withstand when they change.\n And that means we also look at, for example, what it means for societies when suddenly\n weather is not weather anymore, when the seasons are not more seasons but always extremes and for example also in the case now what happens\n when in the city center suddenly so that walking around the city is not possible anymore because\n the heat is caught right there. You are still studying in G\u00f6ttingen. Exactly.",
      "At the moment it's very sloppy that everyone who likes Fridays for Future\n and gives out great solidarity addresses, but let's say all adults\n are not able to conclude that they should do exactly the same.\n So, for example, if I am a Scientist for Future,\n it is not enough that I say I am a Scientist for Future and make an autograph,\n but then I have to go to the institute at least one day a week. Then I have to stop creating any reports or\n anything else. Because you have to create a disturbance in the system, called civil disobedience,\n to exert political pressure.\n Can there be an economic system that is not capitalist?\n My question is, can there be a capitalist economic system that is not destructive?\n He said, growth is only increased consumption.\n And if we simply change the wording and instead of growth,\n say increased consumption, we suddenly have a completely different game plan. You have to imagine that the coalition agreement, communiques after G20 summits and so on,\n start with the sentence, we have succeeded in increasing consumption.\n If you introduce the change of course, which requires a lot of effort,\n then of course you don't know what comes out of it.\n So you can't imagine that linearly.\n My suggestion would be to get rid of cars.\n If I have emptied the room of this nonsense,\n suddenly new possibilities arise,\n which I don't see yet, as long as the room is still full.\n So, a new episode of Jung Naiv. We are in Berlin, where exactly?\n At Futur 2. Who are you?\n Harald Welzer. We know you, you were already\n there for two years. Back then we interviewed you in Potsdam, I think.\n Well, that was in private. Now we are in the Futur 2 office.\n I know that because you interviewed me here a year ago.\n Exactly, exactly.\n Let's turn that around again.\n Yes, I'm in for it.\n We just finished a few weeks after the European election, after a Rezo video and so on and so forth.\n Let's start with Rezo. Have you dealt with it?\n Well, I have more than that somehow at four million or so I came up million I also decided to watch it.\n Well, I'm not that familiar with social networks.\n You read in the newspaper that there is a video.\n No, not really, but it doesn't matter, you don't have to reconstruct it.\n And then I watched it in full and was colossally impressed and enthusiastic.\n I thought it was totally great.\n Why?\n Well, why? Because nobody expected it to be such an elaborate, well-founded, well-considered and well-spoken\n overall package for the CDU and the SPD.\n Did you learn something?\n Did he tell you something,\n any topic that you didn't know about before?\n No, I don't think so.\n But I'm not typical,\n because these are topics\n I'm also professionally engaged in.\n With drug policy? With Rammstein?\n Well, man, but I'm\n an informed contemporary.\n Insofar, you can ask me anything.\n No.\n Okay.\n And what I really liked was how he explained and presented this complicated topic of climate change in 20 minutes.\n I thought that was great.\n Did you think about your election?\n No.\n Who did you vote for?\n I voted for the Greens.\n Why?\n For different reasons.\n I promise myself that they will\n now, because there is a social\n backwind for a more serious climate policy, that they now, because there is currently a social backwind for a more serious climate policy,\n that they may not exclude themselves from the sedating general discourse of the type\n of prosperity increase and climate protection, etc.,\n that they now have the chance to say goodbye to it, to speak a little more truth, to make a little different demands and use this backwind, a different form of political culture.\n But do you see that they are doing that? I mean, I asked the scientists at this famous BBK with the Scientists for Future if there is one party that represents science as a minimum measure.\n They said the Greens and the Left are the most important, but they don't do it.\n Yes, but they can do it.\n So now the situation is different.\n Now there is an pronounced pressure, but that means a backwind for the Greens."

    "response": "\nThe recurring images in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as described in the interview, include violence, suffering, and a lack of resolution. These images can be traced back to at least 1948, when 300,000 Palestinian Arabs lost their homes and were forced to move away due to the establishment of the State of Israel. Moreover, the conflict has its roots in the British Mandate period, particularly in 1929 during the Palestine riots. Images of violence and displacement continue to persist in the present day, with the recent escalations in October 2023 being another tragic example.",
    "contexts": [
      "And even before 1948. The images you describe were in Palestine, British mandate area, in 1929.\n Only the military jeeps were from the British. Yes, the military jeeps were from the British, but in 1929, when we were under the pressure of anti-Semitism in Germany\n and the promises of the British, the opposite promises to the Jews, to their own Jewish state in the region,\n as well as to the Arabs on their own Arab state in the region.\n These promises, completely contrary, have been made by the English since 1913.\n Then there was, under the impression of international antisemitism,\n there was a migration of Jewish settlers into the region.\n Then in the 1920s there was a time of, one could say, coexistence of the two groups.\n And then in 1929 there was a violent confrontation.\n In one year, over 100 Palestinians Palestinians killed by Jewish settlers in one year.\n And over 100 Jewish settlers have been killed by Palestinians.\n This conflict has existed for 100 years.\n And I think that's something that is incredibly depressing to me, that we can't even say that this is an actual situation that is perpetuating itself.\n But she has been there for three generations and she has nothing to do with genetics.\n The whole region where she is. But you are now taking my point. I really wanted to look specifically at the West Jordan region.\n Because that is under Israeli occupation and the same pictures are produced over and over again.\n Why don't we question what the causes are? That's my point.\n I actually wanted to talk about that. There should be no detour.\n I totally understand that, but there were other political contexts, maybe, I don't know.\n But it's just ... and then I come to this point, people are tired.\n And I don't think many Palestinians have a big version right now, because they know the same pictures.\n The child goes through the same thing his father went through, the same things his grandpa went through.\n I think for many people it's just about getting through their everyday life, leading a somewhat okay life.\n And that's it.\n So where is the room for visions?\n Can you explain to me, there are Pal\u00e4stinensis, the is the Palestinian leadership\n the world wants a two state solution\n how should the Palestinian state look like?\n There is Gaza\n Israel in between\n part of Jerusalem\n and the West Bank\n three parts of the country should be three pieces of land\n and one state.\n That's the idea?\n Yes, but as I said,\n and then through a tunnel\n or a bridge, the two pieces\n are connected.\n Since I've been\n dealing with it and since I've seen\n the reality with my own eyes,\n I know that this is not an option.\n Not because I think it sucks or wouldn't want to, but because it's not practical.\n And because it's not wanted. It's not wanted either.\n And at least, there was no single Israeli government that wouldn't have the construction of settlements in the West Jordan region, no matter which party it was.\n That was always a fundamental part of Israeli politics.\n And ultimately the Jewish history in this country is mainly in the cities in the West Jordan region.\n So Hebron is a holy city for Judaism, Nablus, so actually the important cities for Jewish people from a religious perspective,\n that's not Tel Aviv and Haifa, those are cities like Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus, among others.\n That means I don't see at the government giving up West Jordan at all.\n And apart from having two pieces.\n It's always so funny, there are these chains that both Israelis and Palestinians wear, where you have this whole card on it.\n Yes, and you don't know...\n And for Israelis it's always so completely Israel and for Palestinians it's always like this, all Israel, and for Palestinians it's all Palestine.\n And there was a meme on Instagram, like, how should the Palestinian chain look like?\n Because you just have two pieces that are not connected.\n I have no idea how this should be implemented, but I don't want to waste so much time on it, because it won't happen.\n I would like to say something else about the two-state solution.\n I believe that we care so much about it because we are also caught up in the concept, in the terminology of the national state. And if you think\n in a national state,\n then that's the solution.\n Everyone gets a national state and that's it.",
      "To package it so colonial and to represent it as a conflict between white and brown people is very modern at the moment.\n I find it just as disgusting as what comes from the right, to be honest.\n Did you learn Hebrew?\n I learned Hebrew, I also spoke it quite well, but I don't do it anymore today.\n Not enough exercise? Not enough exercise. I have to say, I didn't go back to Israel that often because saw the other side of the coin.\n I saw what my Israeli friends told me about Palestinians and that they told me something completely different.\n I understood that the reality was a bit more complicated.\n And then I didn't go back.\n then I didn't drive back. Does that hurt you, what is happening nowadays?\n We are talking about October 2023.\n For people who will hear this later.\n This is a tragedy what is happening right now.\n This disgusting pogrom of the Hamas,\n who really put it on, to be as cruel as possible,\n who of course have triggered deep historical traumas in Jewish people,\n who now believed that the State of Israel is the state where they are safe, where something like this can't happen.\n Which is already a problematic idea from the front, because the state has been carrying out terrorism and wars for a long time.\n So whether Jews are safer through the existence of the State of Israel is a question.\n But that was of course an enormous trauma.\n And one must also say, of course Hamas builds their centers\n under hospitals and schools and in heavily populated areas.\n That means it is almost impossible to fight them without affecting civilians.\n But it is of course an endless catastrophe.\n And it is also a catastrophe where you really don't see a good solution.\n Because there are also two million people in Graz that are in a cage and are experiencing terrible things at the moment.\n And most of them are absolutely innocent people who just want to live their lives. So this is simply a real nightmare scenario and it is very difficult to see how it can be\n solved. And a new generation of hate is being created, probably on both sides. And yes, such strong experiences are mostly stronger than rational arguments.\n But one thing is clear, if you practice more violence, you have more.\n And that is true for all those involved in this conflict. In Africa, when there are people who say, okay, what happened on October 7th is inexcusable, terror is not to be justified, then some say, but something like that doesn't arise in a vacuum, something like that has a prehistory.\n They try to contextualize it.\n Yes, as Slava \u0160i\u017eek said at the book fair.\n Others say it's a relativization of such a deed.\n How do you react as a historian?\n Well, as a historian I want to understand how situations arose.\n And that's why it's of course important to know that in 1948 300,000 Palestinian Arabs lost their homes and were forced to move away.\n That's why it's of course important to know that Palestinians were also brutalized and deported.\n That's why it's also important to know that Hamas, a criminal government that had been holding the Gaza Strip economically destroyed for a long time,\n and I mean, it could be a flourishing place.\n It could be Singapore in the Eastern Mediterranean,\n if there had been smarter political minds who would have led this. So, of course I'm interested in how all these things work together to create the situation that is now there.\n I wouldn't say that you say after the conviction of the crime, says, but. But first you have to stand still.\n This is a terrible crime.\n And then you can see that the crime is, as Slavoj \u0160i\u0161ek said with great\n respect, not in a vacuum.\n And of course no crime arises in a vacuum, of course not. And even without this pogrom on October 7, this would be an\n unstoppable situation for millions of people that somehow has to be resolved.\n For both sides, right?\n Also for both sides. And I mean, David Grossmann, an Israeli writer\n who I respect very, very much, also know well,\n he always points out how corruptive, and indeed personally, morally corruptive,\n it is also for the Israelis who are in the occupied areas,\n who do this work, that is, in the army,\n and treat other people like that.\n And then he goes back to their families.\n You can't just leave that at home. Or leave it out of the house.\n That means, of course, both sides are traumatized by it."

And to observe that is very interesting.\n Why did you move there?\n It was a coincidence. I actually traveled there and stayed there. There was no big plan behind it.\n How old were you?\n 27.\n Oh.\n Yes.\n Did you just want to go on vacation?\n Yes, I went stay a little longer.\n What was so interesting about 1994 in Peking? So that Frank thinks, I'll stay.\n It was a society in its infancy and you could feel that in every corner. And that you can do a lot of things, that you can design.\n In football, you would say, play in the open space. And that was 1994. So you could feel that at every corner and at every end of this city.\n That you can build something there, that you can develop something.\n Now you say shock Tiananmen, what does that mean?\n Oh, that was the overthrow of the protest movement in 1989. And the square is called Tiananmen Square.\n Why was that a shock? For whom? For the system?\n For all people, of course. That was clear.\n It was a... I don't know why you have to ask the question that it's a shock, because it's actually a matter of course.\n People were shot down by tanks and that was of course a shock for the country.\n Why did people get up then?\n Originally it was an economic crisis with 30% inflation in 1988.\n And then the students sat on top and demanded more freedom, more\n demanded play space. Which you didn't get? Which you didn't get, at least not\n as you wanted. Has there been something like that since then? No. Why?\n That has to do with economic reasons, that there was never a big economic crisis afterwards.\n And the majority of people feel that their personal freedom is constantly increasing.\n And that's why there was no pressure in the bowl. At the end of last year, only a few days, when the protesters held up these white cards.\n But that was only a very small movement, if not in several cities.\n But otherwise, people are busy earning money, making sure that their children have a better education, to travel, to develop their personal freedoms.\n Was that also a movement for more co-determination.\n But it wasn't a constitutional movement for democracy in the narrow sense.\n You didn't wish to have our leader elected?\n That didn't play a central role. It was more about the question of more determination. It remained more vague.\n Basically, you wanted to determine more where it would go.\n Can young Chinese people learn something about the student movement from back then, if they wanted to?\n So could they read something about it in Chinese media or in the internet?\n Not in the censored media, but they could of course download a VPN channel, like many hundred million people do.\n And then they have access to all international media, also in Chinese language.\n That works.\n Do you also do research?\n Yes, sure.\n Is that difficult?\n No. Why?\n It's just a program, you press on and everything is fine.\n I think the least VPR users use it all the time, but we don't need it, do we?\n Exactly.\n Okay. You were 27, you stayed with your family?\n No, back then...\n You mean you went with your girlfriend?\n Yes, but that wasn't family yet. That was my girlfriend and family came much later. So children.\n Now you're almost 30 years old.\n Yes, exactly.\n Do you speak all Chinese fluently? No. My children laugh at me.\n I just got stuck at some point, so to speak.\n If you don't sit down every night and learn for three hours, you won't get any further at some point.\n And I prefer to drink a glass of wine in the evening.\n Do you speak Mandarin?\n Yes, most people speak Mandarin. There are basically only two major languages.\n That is Cantonese, which is spoken in the south, but the main language is Mandarin.",
      "Of most people.\n If you had asked them in the 90s, do you think it is possible that you have this or that standard of living.\n Then she would have said, that's unimaginable.\n In this respect, they certainly feel a freedom, an increasing freedom.\n This freedom comes with increasing play, to be able to decide for oneself, to have the economic foundations, to be able to decide.\n If it's about voting now, then\u2026\n A political freedom, exactly.\n A political freedom, then there is, so to speak, then they would feel rather, or some would feel rather, unfree.\n But do you know that you live in a dictatorship? That was always the question at the beginning. That you can't vote for Xi.\n Of course you know that you can't vote for the Communist Party.\n The question is, what do you know about this question? They simply weigh advantages and disadvantages soberly and say that I now live in this system has great advantages but also great disadvantages.\n And I would say the system exists as long as the balance, so if I weigh disadvantages and advantages, as long as the advantages are superior. Very simple.\n In the moment when the majority of the Chinese population has the feeling that the system in which they live has more disadvantages, they are immediately on the street.\n And no state security and no surveillance technology, even if it is developed in this way, can prevent it.\n And that's why the Communist Party is striving. It is afraid of it.\n How does the Communist Party or the Chinese media explain what is happening in the West?\n That we are voting, that we are we change our government leaders because of elections?\n We explain that to the Chinese.\n Do you know what I mean?\n Yes.\n It has to fit ideologically somehow.\n Well, they explain above all ...\n Someone was voted out because they were dissatisfied.\n Well, they explain above all the disadvantages.\n So it's clear, if I, so to speak, advocate a different political system, then I explain to my population above all what the other system has for disadvantages.\n And then you have to say, unfortunately, the disadvantages are rather greater than smaller.\n The topic of political stability, the topic of what I said earlier, why do you need 8-900 million US dollars for a presidential election, who gives you the money and do you have to do what the voters want or do you have to do what the money givers want?\n Such topics. Can you look into the future? Can you plan for 10, 20 years in such a political system?\n These are topics that they emphasize to secure their own power.\n But don't they wonder why German-Americans always exchange their government?\n Well, not with us in the last 60 years, but you know what I mean.\n Do you have to explain to them why we vote? Do you have friends who you say, listen up?\n They're not stupid.\n They're not stupid?\n No.\n They also learn at school that there are elections and stuff.\n Yes, and they go at it in detail.\n So that's the difference. They look at the pros and cons pretty soberly.\n And we don't do that. We say good and bad. Right and wrong, good and bad. And that could be a disadvantage for us in the long run,\n because it reduces our ability to develop strategies adapted to reality.\n And in this respect, the Chinese are more open. So they try to learn more from others, they look at each other more and they don't have this attitude, we are good and they are evil.\n Is there an opposition in China?\n Yes, of course.\n Who is that? Or what does that mean? Well, you can't answer that so pausally. There are people who don't want that for every topic.\n They are, parts of the opposition are organized within the party.\n This is a very, very, this party is a very, very heterogeneous event. And it is even a goal of the party to integrate as many forces as possible\n to then, so to speak, within the party, to evaluate it.\n How much market and how much state is now, for example,\n there is an opposition that says more market and the other says more state. There is also an opposition that wants to abolish the state, the party.\n But it is not very effective yet.\n Because most people say that when weighing the pros and cons, the advantages are more important.\n If that falls, this opposition is suddenly there and in the front.\n this opposition is suddenly there and in the front line."

Now we do decent heroin projects, targeted I was in Switzerland and looked at all of this.\n We really got targeted projects through.\n I was very involved in that at the time.\n I was also in Frankfurt.\n To create such spaces, meeting points, where drug addicts can go,\n so that they get sterile syringes, so that there is a targeted disposal.\n Of course, there is also a controlled one.\n The police do not always have access, but if something is there, they are brought in.\n So there are also such models like Vendi.\n And at that time I was very, very busy with that\n and we also brought some very good things along in this way.\n Also to see where you can help there.\n But it was not the big criminal law reform\n with the motto, everything is legalized.\n The Greens wanted more and more.\n They are ruling everywhere.\n I don't hear anything about that.\n But let's get there sometime.\n When is Germany ready?\n In America it's...\n At the moment it's going in the other direction.\n I don't see that we can get a basic rule\n about what is possible in practice from now on. I don't see that we can get a basic regulation of the release now.\n Cannabis can now be used as a drug.\n There are active substances that can really help with certain pain.\n It's a medicine, it's also a medicine.\n It took forever, we've already talked about it back then.\n But now the study is coming and finally it's here.\n So at the moment I don't see it, to be honest.\n It's always been sensitized differently.\n As far as alcohol is concerned, especially with young people,\n you'd rather look at how you can do all sorts of things to get rid of the hangover,\n which has maybe become less common,\n smoking is only a ban on all places,\n you can hardly smoke outside the door without anyone looking at you.\n I don't smoke, but I think everyone should be able to live that way.\n It's good that you can't allow it, it just tastes better.\n But we have a tendency to try to keep things more narrow and to forbid or restrict things.\n And that is also taken up more openly by society.\n At the moment there is no debate at all.\n Back then it was a really big public debate.\n You can't believe how many young people...\n One of the top topics besides basic income is the release of marijuana.\n Really?\n Yes.\n The big topic.\n So, the Julis, our youth organization, has been demanding this since I can remember.\n We were always a bit more progressive in Bavaria. a decision as a party, I was chairman of state.\n So I was never a fighter against it. I always said, people in the coalition, we have no chance.\n And you have to say that, otherwise people think, people will get it if they say it. And they also put it through.\n At the moment I don't see a partner with whom you can implement it.\n I can remember 2009-2013,\n when stock data storage was already a big topic.\n But what for one?\n And it didn't come.\n There was the stock data storage,\n so this storage of all data when you communicate.\n They have already done did in the government before?\n That's what the big coalition introduced in 2006.\n There was a European legislation and then the Minister of Justice,\n Ms. Tsipras, negotiated with it and then it had to be implemented in German law.\n So you would have to prevent it in Europe at that time, you didn't have to.\n And then there was a regulation here, we had it, we were in opposition, I was in the court of law,\n I was also a rapporteur for it, we were against it.\n And then I sued against it. The regulation was revoked, I sued against it.\n By the way, also with the lawsuit, I sued against it with friends.",
      "This is not directly part of the topic of drug and addiction,\n but it is also about cannabis.\n It is a medical issue that is being evaluated at the moment.\n But you have the expertise.\n At that point, it is necessary and important that we actually created this possibility back then.\n I think that's the right way.\n I would also imagine and could imagine that we would lead this debate about the ability to treat,\n about the best treatment possibility again.\n We are missing some studies in Germany that we we have to initiate. Yes, but the medical or cannabis as a drug for medical use,\n the effect is not controversial.\n And when you say opiate, painkillers are provided,\n and here, too, with cannabis, if it is medically administered, there is a benefit.\n It would only be logical that the banks would take over that.\n The banks take over when it is approved,\n it is proven that there is a benefit.\n Not every treatment method has a benefit and can be proven.\n And the study situation is extremely small in this regard.\n I used myself for this, among other things,\n that we shouldn't prescribe opiates too easily in Germany,\n but they also have their rights in some therapies.\n And this possibility, what we use in the therapies,\n what helps and what doesn't,\n a doctor has to decide about that.\n That's the essential thing.\n I don't want self-medication,\n even if it's about cannabis.\n That's the point of contact\n where many people now write me down.\n When we talk about the question\n of regulation of cannabis,\n I want us to stay in the medical cannabis,\n as far as possible in the medical field.\n That is necessary and right,\n so that it can also happen under medical supervision\n when it comes to therapy.\n And I think it's good\n if we really have relief\n in the possibility of prescription.\n Then the circle is covered again.\n What do you think\n of the possibilities of consumption\n in the local coffee shops?\n For example.\n I would like to say, as far as consumption is concerned,\n no consumption analogous to what we often had in the past,\n for example with tobacco.\n That means a strong restriction,\n also as far as the public sector is concerned.\n Coffee shops, if it is a public sector,\n I would not place them as a consumer location.\n But?\n If it's a public area, no. If coffee shops are a cannabis club, for example fungi, which, this is the thesis, are far less dangerous than cannabis?\n There are actually two questions behind it. The question is how open we are in research, where it is actually also about studying with other psychedelic substances or with other psychotropic substances.\n From my point of view, we really have to do even more.\n The other question, what is more dangerous or not, I cannot answer,\n because it often has to do with my own feeling.\n What I am using is this question, we need more health competence\n in the entire population, which affects the effect of needing more health skills in the general population,\n as far as the effect of psychoactive substances is concerned.\n Also the question of what are the reasons for my consumption,\n why I drink too much coffee, why I drink too much alcohol,\n or why I smoke too much cannabis or take other substances.\n People should also become aware of this and we need more knowledge,\n more information, more advice, but also the one that is part of it.\n Yes, but it's also about practices.\n There was a question, what do you think of an LSD driver's license,\n that young people could also consume LSD in professional-qualified support?\n I cannot imagine LSD consumption in young people.\n And that's why we should...\n I cannot imagine that one would issue driver's licenses about it,\n if it is about young teenagers at this point.\n Teenagers or even almost children.\n What does the federal government want to do about the fact that 13-year-olds are now running around with e-cigarettes?\n That's a development that is really worrisome, which has developed as a hype in the last months.\n I think it's not okay to consume e-cigarettes at the moment.\n The single-use e-cigarettes are not to be found in the hands of children and adolescents.\n They are also forbidden.\n Under 18-year-olds are not allowed to sell them.\n That's why it has to be more respected.\n What do you think of the Portuguese model? That's why it has to be more or other drugs. In Portugal it is always connected, if one becomes noticeable, with advice,\n also therapy and with conversations that are part of it, possibly interventions."

    "query": "What is the stance of Lars Feld, an ex-vorsitzender der Wirtschaftsweisen, on the impact of oligopolies on consumers, and what specific examples does he provide to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of oligopolies?",
    "response": "\nLars Feld acknowledges that oligopolies can create both advantages and disadvantages for consumers. He believes that oligopolies can distribute costs to a larger production, benefiting companies. However, this advantage needs to be passed on to consumers to be considered beneficial. Competition between these companies is crucial for ensuring fair pricing and preventing cancellations. He mentions the example of train production, where a potential merger between Siemens and Alstom was denied due to concerns about creating a dominant market position. Feld also discusses the importance of maintaining competition in the airline industry to avoid monopolistic pricing.",
    "contexts": [
      "That means the costs are distributed to a larger production.\n That is an advantage for the companies. That's an advantage, but it's also an advantage for the customers, for the consumers,\n if this advantage is passed on to them.\n And for that, the competition between these companies must be there.\n In this respect, an oligopoly is not bad per se,\n but it has to be regulated accordingly.\n But that splits into a advantage and a disadvantage.\n If they pass it on to you, it's an advantage, if not, it's a disadvantage.\n Normally, the competition ensures that we have a price increase.\n Unless they cancel it.\n Unless they cancel it. And that's why you have to prevent the cancellation.\n We're obviously not that good in that, if there's still oligopoly in Germany.\n Every cancellation ... wait a minute, if there are cartel agreements in Germany, we are not so good.\n The oligopoly itself is not harmful, so again, I emphasize it again, the oligopoly itself is not harmful, but the question is, are there agreements?\n And the nature of such secret agreements is that you can only discover them afterwards.\n That's always the case. So we have to make sure that our competition authorities are good enough to think about it in time.\n But they are not there to prevent oligopoly or get rid overrides or fusions at eye level,\n that is checked in which form a market-dominated position occurs here\n and the fusion is then subordinated.\n We had this in the press at the production of trains by Siemens and Alstom. Both wanted to merge, that would have been a\n merger at eye level, so they wanted to work together in this branch and that has been\n denied by the cartel authorities. Now we have the collaboration Alstom-Bombardier,\n which has been approved. But of course we would have had a completely different situation.\n A market-dominant position would have been created and the competition authorities\n did not allow it, in my opinion. It's a difficult case, I know that.\n I'm sure I'll get bad signatures now, that's always the case when I say it so clearly.\n There is always the discussion whether or not you champions are needed to be able to compete internationally.\n The market is also international.\n But I think it's wrong to want to have a national champion who can set higher prices in Europe or in Germany, i.e. monopolistic prices,\n can use his market-dominant position to have more available so that he can compete in China.\n I think that's wrong.\n You're describing Lufthansa, right?\n No, Lufthansa is a different situation.\n At the moment Lufthansa is pretty much on the ground.\n I've read that Lufthansa makes nice, fat prices here in Germany.\n That's why this question of monopoly is a bit difficult.\n That's what I'm asking.\n Finding out one of these monopolists is difficult.\n But of course there are always monopolies on very specific market parts.\n So, one example, very simple.\n My airport is Basel-M\u00fchlhus normally.\n That means I have to go to M\u00fchlhausen,\n which belongs to the Swiss operator of this airport,\n and then flies to Berlin or somewhere else.\n For a long time there were flight slots from Basel-M\u00fchlhus to Munich that were only operated by the Lufthansa.\n After the deployment of Air Berlin, Easyjet took over a number over slots, they also got slots to Munich for compensation for what they had given to the Lufthansa elsewhere in Basel-M\u00fclhoz.\n And suddenly the prices that the Lufthansa demanded have dropped by a third.\n Of course we have the situation that is then again and again tried to be exploited on site. Am I the only provider who does that now or not. Can you as a state simply ensure that there is no monopoly?\n So by making preventive laws or regulations, that you say, okay, a company shouldn't just get bigger or something.\n I think you can't do that that way.\n So to say that's the right size, that's not possible to determine. You can also use other that's the right size.\n You can also use other factors besides size.\n I think you have to try to decide procedurally.\n What I just mentioned, the creation of national champions,\n this goal setting in the system of a political system,\n is wrong in my opinion. You shouldn't do that.",
      "That would have been the second question. Do we have oligopolists?\n We certainly do. In many industries. In telecommunications, in cars, certainly also air transport.\n Post office?\n You certainly have that in the post office too. You have a lot of providers.\n So you have it in a lot of big industries.\n That's alarming, isn't it? Why doesn't politics do that?\n It's difficult. Google. Google would be a monopolist.\n That's really a monopolist, because 95% of the search is running on Google.\n I have a German monopolist now. German oligopoly.\n Yes, some areas.\n It's not always bad that you have oligopoly,\n as long as the competition pressure on these companies is so high\n that they really don't say, I'm going to kick the consumers out.\n You mentioned the car manufacturers earlier. so big that they really don't say so I'm playing the consumers off the example you mentioned earlier\n the car builders are oligopol and that's exactly what they did there yes but we germans could\n also buy a japanese car i had to admit i don't have a car but we have here for the institute\n i don't want to be a smuggler where you buy a the institute. You don't believe what a mess that was.\n If you didn't buy a Tesla, that's...\n Now you got me.\n No, we stand for electromobility and for climate and energy.\n These are important topics for us.\n And then you have to stand for it as an institute.\n Electromobility is an example for us of what it leads to when companies have such a strong market power.\n That's my concern with German automakers, that they say, we're doing great, we're selling cars without end, especially to German consumers.\n And we don't need electromobility, we'd rather continue with diesel.\n And that's my concern, that such a behavior ultimately leads to companies going with the times and then eventually getting rid of themselves.\n Are there oligarchs in Germany?\n Oh, I wouldn't say that. There are certainly some very the German democracy, we have now also done that in the last one and a half, two hours.\n But I think we have already, if I compare that with other countries, with the USA or Great Britain or South Europe, we already have a very good democracy and I have of respect for that. Quint and Schaeffler and so on?\n Friede Springer?\n No.\n Desmond?\n No.\n No, I wouldn't describe that.\n Those are entrepreneurs who, of course, also inherited from the family and continue to do so.\n And have a lot of entrepreneurial power and influence and thus certainly also exert political influence.\n But I have to say, I have great respect for the German politicians and I get to know\n many and I have to say that in the big picture I really have great respect for their\n commitment, for their competence.\n And I think they are also honest.\n So I really want to break a lance there. I think we like to curse at politics. we have done that in the last two hours, to the right, to a large extent.\n But I would suggest that they are not in our finger, at the oligarchs.\n I always ask myself, now I have a top economist here, if we have something like that ourselves.\n As I said, I wouldn't say that.\n In which social areas should there be no market?\n There should be no market for the things that are essential for our existence and for our well-being.\n What are they?\n Defense, security, certainly also in the area of basic security.\n Or to say, maybe a strange example, but the politics of the state has the responsibility that every person in Germany has the minimum\n to exist. And then he can say, okay, there are different providers, there are also in other\n countries, that everything is organized privately. In the USA there are 20, 30 million people who do not have\n health insurance at all. These are things where I say, you can't just say there is a\n duty for the state to say, we will take care of it. And health?\n No, I would not say health. The question is to ensure health insurance. Yes, I think the state must do that.\n Everyone has a health insurance.\n That there can be competition between private and public health systems between providers, I think that's good.\n That should make them more efficient."

    "query": "What is the controversy surrounding the investment protection clauses in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement between the European Union and the United States, and which specific international courts are involved in these disputes?",
    "response": "\nThe controversy revolves around the perceived negative impact of the investment protection clauses in TTIP on legal principles and democratic processes. These clauses may potentially undermine national sovereignty, limit regulation, and favor large corporations over smaller businesses. Critics argue that these provisions could lead to a race to the bottom in environmental and labor protections. Additionally, the lack of transparency in the negotiations and limited access to key documents has led to widespread dissatisfaction among non-governmental organizations and the general public. As for the involvement of international courts, the European Court of Justice and possibly the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) might handle disputes arising from the TTIP agreement.",
    "contexts": [
      "Yes.\n Therefore, only the vocational practice for this kind of judges is the only thing that contradicts many legal principles.\n And that's why in a modern international trade agreement these clause of investment protection are not to be sought.\n On which law does such a judgment base? Where does this judge base on this and that law?\n In the end, the courts are there to issue the laws.\n Yes, but they are just very vague decisions.\n The law that is laid down is the law that is in these trade agreements.\n And then there are only very vague decisions in there.\n It has to be plausible and it has to be appropriate.\n And similar vocabulary is then used there.\n In other words, the door and gate is open.\n You said that this TTIP is negotiated by the EU and the US government.\n But why do you talk about corporations all the time?\n Do corporations act with it or do they just say,\n hey, if you were a EU member, hey Harald, think about us, or are you sitting here with us?\n Yes, that's the interesting thing.\n In a formal way, the EU Commission negotiates on behalf of the government, the member states, and they have given you the mandate.\n But if you reconstruct the story, how did this mandate come about?\n So, in other words, what should they negotiate on?\n What is the goal of this negotiation?\n And with what demands does the EU Commission enter this negotiation,\n then one realizes that the inquiries, the consultations, how this came about,\n almost always took place only with representatives of international corporations,\n which interestingly then talk on both sides, yes, talk with each other.\n So on the American side, sometimes the same corporations are talking with them as on the European side.\n They negotiate with themselves.\n Not directly. The officials, i.e. the representatives of the government or the commission, are negotiating.\n But the crazy thing is that in this negotiation process the lawyers and representatives of the international corporations are indirectly involved.\n So they get regular insight into the protocols, while the public and even the parliamentarians,\n even the parliamentarians of the European Parliament, had no access to these documents.\n What?\n Yes, it is a grotesque procedure where you can basically see how far the penetration of statehood\n by internationally operating corporations has already been forced. So, if you will, many people are for the first time opened their eyes to what power actually\n from transnational organized companies is now going out, that it is so far into the state organs\n like EU commissions or the US government has entered.\n However, one must honestly say, especially because it is so extreme in this case, the reaction of non-governmental organizations has fallen very hard.\n And there is a broad, organized resistance on both sides of the Atlantic against all possible aspects of this agreement.\n Of course not against trade itself. I mean, America will always remain the most important trading partner for all European countries, or most of them.\n And vice versa, Europe too. I think daily 8 or 10 billion euros in goods and services go to the Atlantic.\n So the question is not that we somehow disturb trade with the Americans.\n But it should be even better and even more.\n Yes, but the protests are directed against the form of the negotiations,\n that everything is completely transparent,\n that the documents are not publicly accessible,\n that the critics have no access to these negotiations,\n as the representatives of the corporations have access.\n And they are directed against individual regulations\n and they express the fear that,\n under circumstances, because it is negotiated behind closed doors,\n technical norms are used as a prerequisite to unify social protection or environmental regulations at a low level.\n The Americans are better in some things,\n for example in the test of drugs.\n They are tested stricter in America than in Europe.\n The Europeans are stricter in terms of food\n and food additives or how they are processed.\n That means, where it is stricter, it is reduced?\n That could be the result,\n even if the responsible parties now, after the big wave of protests, always promise the opposite.\n I always believe these things only when I get them read in black and white.\n What also concerns me is that the EU Commission, interestingly enough, wants to introduce a transatlantic regulatory council, where corporations can participate from the beginning,\n when new rules and laws are being planned.",

That is why it is necessary to block this current approach to this agreement, if you will,\n and to say, no, a completely new trade mandate must be issued.\n And by the way, even if this does not play a role in the public debate, I find it extremely important. It must not be that Europe and America set all possible standards\n and do not consider the interests of the poorer countries.\n So what is useful is when Europe and America try to establish a global standard\n in which the developing countries, which have a heavy stand with their foreign trade,\n are further disadvantaged.\n In this respect, you should basically include representatives of these countries\n in such negotiations from the beginning, so that these interests play a role.\n Unfortunately, this has not been discussed at all so far, but it should.\n Can you explain briefly what a transnational corporation is?\n This is a company that also holds branches in many different countries at the same time, usually also production units, branches.\n And that I didn't define it primarily to say we are a German company or an American or a British.\n Do you have a German example for a transnational corporation?\n Siemens, Deutsche Bank, BASF.\n Basically, you could say that all 30 DAX corporations that are in the German stock index are all transnational companies.\n They have an interest in this TTIP happening?\n Yes, because they can most easily fulfill their interests outside of the parliaments.\n Why are you talking about the parliaments?\n Again to the transnational companies, because many people don't know this.\n The majority of these companies are not only owned by non-German shareholders,\n but they also make up more than two thirds of their revenues outside of Germany.\n But they probably only pay taxes on their profits in Germany, right?\n No, of course not. No, they try to pay taxes on their profits as much as possible where they have to pay as little as possible.\n That's why, with all sorts of tricks, the taxes are stored in low-income countries.\n For example, there are extremely high profits in Ireland.\n Because in Ireland, only 12.5% of taxes fall on company profits and if you combine it with another company shift on the Virgin Islands or the Bahamas,\n then you even come to less than 3%.\n In this respect, unfortunately, you can no longer say that with taxes.\n What is going on with these corporations these days?\n They go where the get the least taxes, they want to make sure that the lowest rules are in place everywhere.\n Why do they want to make it so easy everywhere?\n Why do they want to make it harder for all the other normal citizens and workers?\n They have to work more and so on.\n Well, because it's from the point of view of those who are in the board of directors of the companies,\n their task is to increase the benefit for their shareholders.\n In other words, to raise the profits.\n If you can reduce the costs by having to pay less taxes,\n less wages, less environmental costs,\n then you can increase the profits.\n I learned from my business expert that they are forced,\n so these shareholders are forced to maximize their share rights.\n That's what they always say."

I have a new guest. Who are you?\n I am Nike Slavik, member of the German Bundestag.\n Since when? For whom?\n Since the last Bundestag election for B\u00fcndnis 90 Die Gr\u00fcnen.\n Why is that?\n That's because I've been a candidate and have long time, since I was 15 years old,\n I was active in the Green Youth, in the Greens,\n and I was particularly involved in climate protection and human rights and queer rights.\n I wanted to take that role into the Bundestag.\n You've been in there for over a year now. Are your dreams already broken?\n Uh, not broken, but in advance I thought that some things would be a little easier.\n There was a huge change in the last few years in Germany. In Germany, especially many young people who suffered a lot during the long period of the Great Coalition, were alienated.\n There were all these strong social movements from Fridays for Future, millions of people went out into the streets for more climate protection,\n people who were engaged in the Seabrook, in other social movements.\n And you've been thinking for a long time that the youth are no longer political.\n But the last few years have actually shown that the opposite is actually the case.\n And I have now come into parliament with many other young people,\n so with the SPD and the FDP there are also some young members of parliament.\n And I thought, now we turn everything to the left.\n But sometimes it doesn't go as fast as expected.\n Especially with the topic of climate protection,\n there is still far too little happening.\n In my area of work, traffic policy, the climate protection gap is still huge.\n But I still try to celebrate every little success. For example, today we had the first lecture on the Germany ticket,\n which we are now on the way to bring for 49 euros, then to be able to use in all of Germany.\n And I'm trying to look forward to that now.\n You can think about climate protection, traffic policy, we'll talk about that in detail.\n But with what naive ideas did you come to the Bundestag in concrete terms?\n I mean, there was something to it.\n If you say a high number of youths, I think about 70 are now in it,\n young SPD members, many young Greens.\n I think you are over 100 in the coalition together.\n If you would work together, you could really change something, because the others are dependent on you.\n Why don't you do that? Yes, because it's not like all young people who are in parliament now\n really want to change society or the Bundestag completely.\n There are of course many of us, especially the Greens,\n who are socialized from the climate movement, for example.\n Or people from the Jusos.\n But you can already see that, especially in this coalition,\n which has gathered under the blanket of the break-up,\n and after 16 years under which rule, we want to change some things.\n But how exactly it should look like, the ideas are very different.\n Partly between the FDP and us Greens.\n You can always take that from the press.\n For example, with the topic of climate protection. Right now we have the topic of how to continue with the expansion of the autobahn.\n Does Germany still build a lot of new autobahns and spend billions on them?\n Or maybe we don't do that and we build these autobahns even faster,\n with a planning acceleration or not.\n And then many of the conflicts go away,\n because we don't have any common denominator,\n that we don't talk about it as members of our departments,\n but a lot of arguments are expressed directly in the cabinet or on the highest level,\n because we sometimes have a hard time.\n But the cabinet, the government, is the executive. You have to control it and you are above it.\n Purely by the law. And yet you let yourself be told by them what you to say yes and no to, right?\n No, we control the government of course.\n You vote and control it?\n We vote, we control it. We have a lot of good means to do that.",
      "Is he the representative of the climate pollution lobby?\n Can you say that?\n If you look at the election program, then yes.\n I don't know what will be in the coalition agreement later.\n Should he be elected?\n Or be a junior partner?\n Is the CDU the climate pollution lobby in Germany?\n It sounds like that now. She we said in the last hour.\n Yes, I mean, it has been in power for so long and has of course prevented climate progress at this time.\n In this respect, it is the most powerful climate pollution lobby because it was in the government.\n The SPD, however, too.\n The SPD, however, too. But the CDU still had the more decisive ministers, so the Ministry of Ministry of economy, ministry of transport, ministry of nutrition.\n It was all in the hands of the CDU.\n How do you rate the Greens?\n There is Winfried Kretschmann in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg,\n he also has powerful car industry lobbies and other lobbies in his back.\n Does he help them?\n He also wanted to have a bonus for burning last year.\n Yes, exactly. He is certainly on the side who would not achieve the climate goal if he were in power.\n The Greens have an ambitious climate program, of course, as all other parties, except perhaps the Klimaliste or smaller parties. But in the end, she is not quite honest with what actually\n comes to people. So if we want to stick to this goal, then everyday life will have to change\n for all of us. That is quite clear. And now, of course, they are already used to how\n the debates can change. So for a Veggie Day or whatever, they always get the counter campaign\n very quickly. Or as we have seen from the initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft, which has sent out these big ads against Ms. Baerbock.\n They probably keep themselves covered because the climate pollution lobby immediately hits them. It should be more concrete. But I think what's still missing is this honesty to say, if we want to get down to zero, then we won't all fly on vacation all the time and then we all eat a lot less meat.\n And then we walk around the city and can only use renewable energies. But that's changes and the Greens don't dare to say that.\n Who do you explain that to?\n That the climate pollution lobby uses it and then everything that is in the common sense of a healthy human being\n is trampled on ground and ground with campaigns that they can then start.\n But the Greens still exist to prevent the climate pollution lobby from goingact it and then they are afraid that it will counteract it.\n Yes, exactly.\n Which ministries would the Greens,\n assuming it is not unlikely that they will come to the government,\n the next federal government, which ministries would they occupy\n so that the climate pollution lobby has no direct influence on it?\n If we assume that the CDU is now\n hofiert the climate pollution lobby or no direct influence on it, if we assume that the CDU is now personifying the climate pollution lobby or personifying it?\n So for climate policy, of course, the Ministry of Economy decides, there is also\n the energy policy. So it is decided whether to switch to renewables or how long the\n coal power plants will run.\n We were already at the Ministry of Agriculture.\n Ministry of Agriculture, so all the big sectors that emit so much.\n And that's still the Ministry of Transport.\n Then the Ministry of Housing and Construction is also very important.\n A lot is also decided there. Who has to isolate the houses?\n Who pays for it? What standards are there in housing construction?\n How do we promote passive houses and so on?\n That's also a very lobbied field.\n So these would be the four big fields that need to be politically implemented.\n I can already see that the CDU will get the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure and the Ministry of the Interior and the Green Party will get the Ministry of the Environment again.\n Yes, that's not excluded.\n Is the Ministry of the Environment then powerful and important from your point of view?\n So it is definitely important, but it was of course cut.\n So in the past, the energy competence was with the Ministry of the Environment, where it actually belongs.\n Because energy policy is environmental policy or climate pollution politics, depending on how you define it."

    "contexts": [
      "This is very important, especially since this vaccination initiative, this procurement initiative COVAX,\n does not work, where all states actually wanted to order together, so that they could distribute them together\n and not, as it happened, the rich countries simply order something and the poor countries stop them from getting the vaccines.\n But you are also for temporary patent-free vaccines.\n Exactly.\n This would then also be a right on property.\n Exactly. The restriction in view of the pandemic,\n the urgent need that we have to vaccinate large parts of the world population\n if we want to get the pandemic under control,\n if we don't want new mutations to appear every few months.\n And you also have to take into account that the vaccine development has been strongly financed with state funds.\n But do the shareholders of BioNTech not have a human right to dividends? Would you be in danger of that? Well, whether the right to property also includes the right to dividends, we'll have to discuss that with individuals.\n But you know what I mean. These considerations are, if there is a right, what is the legitimate purpose? The legitimate purpose is to fight a pandemic that threatens the world population as a whole,\n also threatens our entire development.\n And the legitimate purpose and then the proportionality.\n And that's where the time element comes in.\n The third year of the pandemic is beginning and the vaccines have been available since the end of 2020.\n There was enough time to find other ways.\n If it didn't work out in that time to bring more vaccines to the global south,\n then it's time for the release bring more vaccines to the global south, then it is time to release the patents.\n The argument that in the global south you need more than the knowledge about the patents is true,\n but in the global south there are also companies that can produce under the complex conditions that it needs for the vaccine development.\n Beate, that's it. Thank you very much. It was very exciting. Maybe you'll come back again at some point.\n I think that's very nice.\n If you also enjoyed it.\n Very much. And if you ...\n You've been director of the WHO for a few years.\n I hope so. So there are still new questions, I think, that we can discuss. Thank you very much for that.\n Then we'll invite you back in and now the audience questions.\n Great.\n I'm curious what Hans brought with him.\n First of all, I brought a general reaction.\n There are quite a few people who say,\n oh, it's a pity that she doesn't go into politics.\n We would like to have someone like that.\n Thank you.\n That's a very positive feedback. But you stay there, you don't want to.\n I have to say thank you, because I take it as appreciation,\n that I have been able to present our position convincingly. But I think it's... I'm staying with the idea that I'm a scientist\n who wants to carry things into politics,\n but that politics works according to other logics.\n And...\n I don't think I'd be good at that.\n It's very easy to say that.\n And I also think that it also needs us with this form of voting for human rights. I'd like bad to say that. And I think we also need this kind of voice for human rights.\n I would like to stay with that.\n But isn't that sometimes a frustrating experience,\n when you know that you know better, you are actually right,\n and then you still present these positions to politicians and politicians in their own right.\n And then they say, yes, it's interesting what you're telling us here, Ms. Rudolph, and then it's not implemented.\n Isn't there sometimes an inner frustration or the thought, why am I not sitting there? I think that, well, Max Weber said that politics is a piece of cake, and human rights work is a piece of even more piece of cake.\n And that shows that it's good that the institute, that we as a national human rights institution, can stay on topics for a long time. The Institute has been working on racism since its founding almost 21 years ago.\n I think that's something that makes it clear that the population also needs to be challenged to implement human rights.\n And that was very concrete. And at the same time I have to say, I don't envy politicians about their job,\n because it's a bone job and to solve difficult, complex questions,\n I have respect for all who listen and try to take as much of what we say.",
      "And I think that's justified,\n because we are absolutely interested in how quickly it is produced and then\n the capacities are secured at that point. The same goes for research. We are interested\n in faster research for humanity. But of course we also have in the price negotiations,\n I don't want to talk about the price negotiations in detail,\n but we have already negotiated the price quite low to the original ideas.\n Of course also with the argumentation,\n but this applies to all manufacturers, not just Biontech,\n for all with whom we have contracts,\n with the argumentation, first of all, we give discount guarantees\n and secondly, we offer research funding at certain points.\n This must now also be made noticeable in price and it does that for everyone. First, we give international institutions, for example CEPI, vaccination funding international or the WHO.\n So we are talking about acceptable prices for African states, but not for free patents?\n I am very sure and very optimistic and very confident, and that is also the basis\n in these contracts and regulations, that we can ensure that this vaccine, as quickly as\n probably never before, can provide a full supply of human health.\n And Germany will make a contribution to this.\n We also make a contribution by financing research and building production.\n Because that's how the product is there.\n The BioNTech-Pfizer plan for next year alone, as of today, if you can scale it further,\n is 1.3 billion doses.\n I know from the other manufacturers that they plan in similar sizes. That means we will, if everyone is admitted,\n within one or two years maximum, if everyone is admitted, have doses with which we\n can vaccinate the whole world and we will do it and we will also support it,\n also financially. But the profits can be made by these companies. Do you think that's okay now?\n It is very different. There are companies like AstraZeneca that make a non-profit price for the pandemic,\n to put it explicitly. They made that decision very consciously. But AstraZeneca is\n also not a startup. Biontech and CureVac have their first product ever on the market. AstraZeneca\n can of course also approach things a little differently in the pre-financing, but for that\n we have the prices accordingly, as I said, from our point of view, so we don't pay much more\n than we pay for a flu vaccination and I think you can deal with that.\n Jens, thank you very much for your time. You have to go again. Let's talk a little longer\n and about paying. You know, thanks to your support there is this format. We are\n not commercial.\n But obviously someone pays.\n Yes, but these are basically money gifts or donations, as they say.\n Thanks Jens. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Thank you. Thank you."

Personally, I believe, however, that the next steps of the community\n are going in the direction of very, very big new problems.\n We have already said that.\n We have completely different things now.\n It is good to lead these identity debates at this point in time.\n But in front of us is how we change our consumption behavior,\n how we deal with climate issues and so on and so forth.\n And as I said, in these times when we all as a society ask ourselves this question,\n the forces on the other side will increase,\n who try to have the whole thing with very simple answers. We currently have the answer to the climate crisis from the right-wing is\n that fewer people should be born in Africa.\n So we see where the debates are going.\n H\u00f6cke's answer to crisis situations in Germany is\n we need controlled re-migration.\n Those who are already here and who may not have been here before,\n should be brought back under controlled cruelty.\n That's what we're all about.\n That's why I'm not in the mood for a positive outlook at the moment.\n I'm not doing that right now.\n But I think a consistent error analysis is always the right way.\n I also believe that a consistent error analysis is very important and at the same time I am very optimistic because I wish that we\n do not only get into trouble in the media debate, that has the effect and that also shows\n neuro-science that it does not lead to people thinking, things are going wrong\n and we have to do something now, but that puts people in a kind of learned helplessness.\n And then nothing happens.\n And we see the opposite with Greta, who was mentioned today.\n Then suddenly a young girl comes along, the problems have been known for decades,\n and suddenly something really happens.\n And that's why I wish that we focus more on constructive approaches,\n but also look at science.\n What opportunities do we get from transformation experiences and other things?\n What potential do we have?\n So that we can not only appreciate and philosophize about whether it really brings something, but maybe even find evidence.",
      "So no, I try to avoid that.\n Have you ever been caught in your life?\n Where you thought, oh god, I've believed that for years? Well, that was the criticism of the market economy that we leftists had at that time,\n because I didn't see that there was not only an anarchy of the markets,\n but that there was an allocation system over the price mechanism and the system of property.\n Not so many foreign goods, Hans.\n Yes, well, allocation. What does allocation mean? Who does what? How are scarce natural resources used best?\n How does it happen that when my laces are torn, I go to the store and get a new one?\n Who takes care that the thing is there? And the other things of everyday life. That's the allocation problem.\n And then I had to learn that this perception that we leftists had was a bit too easy.\n So we only saw it from the point of view of justice and did not see the powerful performance of this market coordination system\n in securing the normal standard of living.\n And that is quite obvious.\n I mean, we have the experiment in our own country.\n We had it in the East.\n That didn't work.\n Those were just nice words and great statistics,\n but the people were poor.\n And in the West, even the workers were better off than in the East.\n I mean, that opened my eyes,\n and that opened the eyes of many of the leftists at the time.\n Did you have role models? Do you still have role models?\n Yes, they are in the field of science. Then of course there are my teachers, who I have in mind. I had great teachers.\n Do you know any?\n I had great teachers. Do you know any?\n I don't know.\n Herbert Timm was the financial science professor in M\u00fcnster,\n who influenced me incredibly.\n There are others, for example Georg Milbrad,\n the former prime minister of Saxony.\n From Junger Naiv?\n Yes.\n That's a good friend and colleague from back then.\n He was also Timm's assistant, but a bit older than me.\n So Tim really impressed me, he is definitely a role model.\n And then there were teachers from the high school who impressed me.\n I have to say, I was in the Helmholtz High School in Bielefeld, that was a great group.\n I don't know if it still is today.\n Teachers were something very special back then.\n If you became a student councilor, you had made it.\n And the family was proud to have a student councilor.\n I don't know if that's still the case today.\n Today the social position of the teacher is no longer the one it was.\n That was still quite extreme during the imperial period,\n that the teacher, the village teacher was something, next to the priest and the policeman.\n That's not anymore. And the professor was also something.\n The professor was treated like a nobleman at that time.\n So if I go back to Bavaria now, Maximilian II, as a pendant and as an alternative to his court state,\n with all these noblemen who were there, tried to develop the field of science. He brought science to Bavaria, founded the Maximilian Order and strengthened the universities and the scientific life by bringing the Prussians from the north to Bavaria.\n And there he founded an alternative to his feudal court state with him.\n He preferred to talk to them.\n You know, back then it was all high-ranking.\n And it also led to the fact that the best in society became teachers.\n That's not the case anymore. Today they become managers.\n And I don't know if society is doing the right thing\n if it takes this choice.\n We should invest much more in education.\n We should also raise the salaries of teachers for our children in schools\n to get even better staff.\n I don't want to get too close to anyone.\n But I'll stick to it.\n What was a teacher at my school time is no longer a teacher today.\n We had examples now.\n Gerd Schr\u00f6der is a political hero, I understand now, right?\n No, that would be really too far.\n Fletcher?\n No.\n Kohl?\n Merkel?\n Oh, Ivo, that's ... no, political heroes.

    "query": "What is the historical background of the negotiations between China and the Vatican regarding the role of Christianity in China and how does it relate to Taiwan's status as an independent state?",
    "response": "\nThe historical background of the negotiations between China and the Vatican concerning the role of Christianity in China dates back to the late 19th century when the Qing Dynasty was in decline and European powers began to exert influence in the region. The relationship between China and the Catholic Church became strained due to the latter's refusal to recognize the Chinese Emperor as the head of the church in China. This led to the establishment of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA) in 1957, which aimed to separate the Church from foreign influence and establish an autonomous Chinese Catholic Church.\n\nIn recent years, both parties have been engaged in negotiations to improve relations and find common ground. These discussions revolve around the role of the Catholic Church in China and the appointment of bishops. However, the issue of Taiwan's status as an independent state remains a contentious topic. While China considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory and insists that it is not an independent state, the United States and other nations maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, supporting its independence. The ongoing tensions surrounding Taiwan's status further complicate the already delicate relationship between China and the Vatican.",
    "contexts": [
      "That's the situation we have nowadays. Every year there is one country in Central America or somewhere in the South Pacific that changes from Taiwan that are still doing this is the Vatican.\n They are still negotiating which role Christianity should have in China.\n And they are making this dependent on it.\n And that is now the basic constellation that Beijing says the whole world recognizes that Taiwan is a part of China.\n And not an independent state.\n And not an independent state.\n All politicians say that.\n And now the question is how it goes on.\n Why hasn't China been in Taiwan for itself out of Taiwan for 50 years?\n Why do you support the democratic government?\n Because they had better things to do. And also because they weren't able to do it yet.\n Because they had to fight the Americans in to fight. Because that's... Exactly.\n Behind that\n is the risk of a third world war.\n And that's why both sides are careful.\n Why do the Americans protect Taiwan?\n What's the strategic\n reason? Well, because it's a weak point\n of China and of course\n power-politically\n you put your finger in the wound\n and turn a little bit.\n That's a weak point because it's a big island in front of the Chinese mainland and from there you could start attacks.\n For example, no, it's also a weak point politically.\n That you always say, Taiwan has a right to self-determination. You can put your finger in the wound politically and militarily.\n Although the USA says, China policy.\n Exactly.\n That contradicts itself.\n That contradicts itself a little bit, yes.\n That's right.\n How could that go on in the next years, decades?\n My assumption is that they will unite. Taiwan and Beijing.\n On a mode like Wendy.\n On a way how you can come together and how both can live.\n I don't think the probability of a war is very high.\n Because unlike Putin, China is not standing with its back to the wall. They don't have to do that.\n And that's my guess, but I don't know.\n That was Taiwan, back to the story. Hong Kong?\n Yes.\n Why was Hong Kong still British until 1997?\n Because it was a colony.\n And the British said, why should we give it back? It's ours. And then in 1997 or in the 80s, Hong Kong was marked off.\n Hong Kong consists of the New Territories, a piece of mainland and an island.\n And the Pact Treaty for the mainland, for the New Territories, was then expired in 1997.\n And then it has ...\n The colonials have a pacts treaty with the ...\n It was a kind of ... yes.\n So the island was colonial and then a part was pacted.\n So ...\n So ...\n Lawmakers would probably now ...\n But that's about it. And And that was the end. And then England said in the mid 80s, Thatcher said, well, then we'll give it back.\n But many people in Hong Kong didn't want that.\n Well, many people in Hong Kong wanted that too. Some wanted it, some didn't. So to speak, that was not quite the case.\n Because of course it was seen realistically that you can't survive without China.\n That's the same in Taiwan.\n How are these countries supposed to live economically?\n So Hong Kong is not a country in that sense.\n But both islands don not living independently economically. They live on the fact that there are factories in the mainland, that they serve the Chinese market.\n Hong Kong is the third to fourth largest financial place in the world because it is next to China. That means that everyone who had a bit of realism said,\n well, it doesn't help.\n If we become independent of China,\n we lose the whole China business\n and just go in.\n That was one thing.\n And the others said,\n I'm not interested in the economy,\n I just want to be independent.\n No matter what, and then we'd get along. Those were the two fronts.\n We've been experiencing this in Hong Kong for 25 years. There are democratic aspirations, there are elections,\n sometimes something is being overthrown, the Chinese. So in Beijing some people are sitting in Hong Kong. The West is protesting in the big and the small.\n But it seems to me that at some point Beijing and Hong Kong have completely fallen in love.\n So it's nice that the West is still on the democratic side and so on.",
      "If the numbers are right, they have a lot of room.\n What does that mean exactly?\n If the economic numbers are right, if the province is prospering they would have plenty of room.\n Big jump. How do you estimate the situation in general in the Indo-Pacific?\n As far as the new world order is concerned, India, Japan, Australia and Asia. Does that fit with the Chinese,\n one can say, increasing demand for leadership?\n Yes, because one has decided to have\n their own interests on the one hand,\n also so to speak hegemonic interests in the\n South Chinese Sea with the occupation of these islands.\n On the other hand, one is interested in running in the group at Sea with the occupation of these islands. On the other hand, you are also interested in running in the group.\n And you are constantly finding that out.\n So the largest free trade zone in the world is around China,\n with countries that you are quite arguing about these islands,\n but at the same time working together economically.\n That is also an ambivalence,\n where you have to say, if you only mention one or the other,\n you do not describe the situation adequately.\n The topic, again, the role of China with the peace plan, Ukraine.\n It is asked, she talked about it,\n that the first point of this peace plan was the declaration of territorial integrity.\n There is being asked, isn't that actually a pretext for China's claim to Taiwan?\n No, because China says, Beijing says, Taiwan is a part of China.\n Yes, exactly.\n Yes, that is from the Chinese...\n And Putin says Donbass is a part of Russia.\n Yes, right.\n Exactly, that's why you can say that the argumentation figure,\n that you say yes, if one of them is part of it, the other is part of it.\n You can say that, yes.\n Okay. From when do you start, this is a bit in the direction of the question we just had,\n from when do you start to reach the borders with freedom of opinion in China?\n Does it start socially or only when it reaches a political level?\n So it does not refer to your work as a German journalist, but to debates,\n also controversial debates in Chinese society and public.\n I would say the size of the group you address is decisive.\n That means?\n The smaller the group, the more you can say.\n Like in the GDR?\n No, not like in the GDR?\n No, not like in the GDR. Much more transparent.\n Ah. You said earlier inflation, 2% in China, I think.\n 2.5, yes.\n 2.5. The man who says, I've been living here for 12 years, we can't even check it, I'm just quoting, he says, I've been living in Central China for 12 years, I think the number is wrong, realistically it is 10%.\n Can you objectify the number somewhere, because between 2 and 10% is a pretty big difference.\n I don't share this assessment. Mhm.\n In the speeches you hear more often the phrase, the wall made of steel.\n How do the Chinese take that up? It sounds scary at first.\n What does this phrase have to do with it? I don't know it.\n How do the Chinese know this?\n What is meant by this?\n I'm wondering too.\n If you don't know them, we can't go on.\n How was the German colonial period in China. You talked about Tsingtao, I think it was called that way.\n Relatively positive because it was only that short.\n And because we were there.\n Exactly, relatively constructive and relatively short.\n Aha.\n In what way would the world with China instead of the USA as a hegemon be better or worse?\n Good question, but we will discuss it next time. We have to talk about it for half an hour.\n I hope it is a better world, but I am not sure. There was a parallel question in context.\n Do you think that those who, like China,\n go from the duopolar world or bipolar world to a multipolar world,\n that they will be satisfied with it in the long term?\n Or is the approach not to say to those who are rising up,\n now we want to be hegemonic?\n That's the big question.\n That's actually the crucial question."

That is not your claim.\n A traffic turn is undoubtedly part of it.\n We'll get to the traffic turn in a moment.

I didn't know that before, that it would be within the next five years. I don't know if you had a glass bottle.\n Before that it was until 2030.\n Yes.

It has to be, if we want to become climate neutral, right?\n We need new drives, we have to talk more about electromobility, we have to talk more about water problems.\n But the goal is no more CO2 emissions.\n That would be the goal.\n No more traffic.

No, I don't think you will really get any further with prohibitions and compulsion. I really don't think so. Because people will distance themselves from it. They won't stick to it and they will say before I do that, then it's just like that.\n And that's the wrong way.

I have to make sure...\n You don't have to let no more burners drive in Berlin until 2026.\n You wouldn't be able to do that.\n Why not? We have to do that according to IPCC.\n Because we don't have an electric charging infrastructure, because we haven't expanded all these areas in the last few years,\n that people in Berlin can already afford an alternative drive.\n When should no more burners drive in Berlin?\n As soon as possible. I don't want to think about the time, as soon as possible.\n But we have to do something about it. You finally need the electric charging infrastructure in Berlin,\n that more people switch to electromobility. You need more tracks in the city.\n Maybe even fewer parking spaces so that fewer burners drive in the city. I am very strong for U-Bahn.",
      "Well, if you say climate neutrality Magpom 2035,\n it means at the latest 2035 no more burn-free cars in Magpom.\n That are stuttering around. are right I don't think\n that we can ban it on a national level but you could do that in the federal council\n you could tell people so here you have 14 years of time with your diesel or as far as I know\n you can no longer allow a combustion engine allowed from 2030. Hopefully, who knows?\n Exactly. And I think the goal must be that we ...\n First of all, I always have to say,\n I think people can drive their cars to the end.\n Now no one has to hand over the key and say,\n now it's over with burners.\n I don't think it's about making the end consumers\n regulations what they are allowed to do and what they can and can't do.\n I think it's about looking at how we can get it done, keyword mobility,\n that I simply have more options in the rural area than I do now.\n It is completely clear that this famous last mile home,\n so we always talk in brackets when we talk about mobility,\n we have the big centers, small centers, middle centers and so on.\n And when it comes to buses, trains and public transport,\n you get everything in time and you have to expand the network.\n You need better railways, you need more bus connections and so on.\n But the last mile or the last few kilometers home\n are unfortunately still cars and they will stay for a while.\n We say, but there must be the option, be the option to drive to the station with a car, for example to drive and then to work with a train and that is for many people\n not given at the moment we have always said and it is extremely important we also have\n an age structure with our citizens and citizens that we always have more and more older people\n who will no longer have a car at some point.\n And they also have to get away from the village and they also have to go to the doctor.\n And we have to expand massively.\n Nothing has happened in the last few years and we have to see that we want to bring the mobility law into effect.\n We said we just have to think together the individual types of traffic, so to speak\n , so these transitions from bus to train to car to bike, they just have to be designed smarter\n because at the moment I can't even take my bike on the bus unless I'm in a\n tour area where there is still a trailer on the back, so the old people are considering getting a new car\n should they get a new one for burners? It usually lasts 15 years.\n I think it's not worth it financially.\n Depending on the size of the car,\n they are probably better off with the e-car and the funding.\n It depends a little on it, but I wouldn't do it.\n How do you want to introduce the traffic wall\n when you come to the government?\n By making sure that we no longer put the money in road expansion like now because that is the only traffic policy we have at the moment\n we build hundreds of kilometers of new roads every year but hardly, for example,\n railways we have different gap locks that we just have to close we have a\n cycle path network which doesn't work at all\n because it stops at the circle borders, so to speak. One circle has been built up to that point,\n then the hammer falls there, so to speak, and then you can't drive on. There are such crazy things.\n And if you look at the fact that we are in a tourist country where many people\n travel by bike, or maybe not by bike but they bring their bikes with them and want to tour around here,\n then they might still have, I'll say, in the viewfinder where I was yesterday,\n some good options because it's super expanded there, but then it stops.\n Does any car street have to be built in Mecklenburg-Port?\n No, I wouldn't say no now.\n I wouldn't say no. I think it's about balancing out what we haven't understood in the last many years.\n We have put the complete focus of mobility on the road.\n And we said, if we need a connection from A to B, then it has to be a road.\n As wide as possible, as fast as possible, whatever.\n And we have to balance out this imbalance between rail, road, bicycle, we have to compensate for that.\n And the focus is definitely on the railway and bicycle.\n You have to go to the doctor."

    "response": "\nThe two key points suggested by Amnesty International for regulating data privacy involve interoperability and stronger regulations. Interoperability refers to making it easier for users to switch between different platforms while maintaining their connections with contacts on other platforms. Stronger regulations include the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which aim to regulate the business models of major tech companies. Amnesty International plans to advocate for these regulations through its involvement in the European Union, where it works to influence policy-making processes.",

      "Exactly, that's when we started to build it up. There are roughly three areas of work.\n One was that after the Snowden-reveal we realized that more and more governments are switching from targeted surveillance to mass surveillance.\n The other was that we noticed, especially as a reaction to the Arab Spring, that many of our amnesty cases,\n i.e. opposition human rights advocates worldwide, were affected by targeted surveillance.\n So that, for example, their smartphones or computers are hacked specifically.\n Often with technology that was exported from Europe.\n And the third is what you, where now not governments,\n but companies were the main drivers and governments\n have missed to regulate and catch companies in time.\n Namely what Shoshana Soubh named surveillance capitalism.\n So this rise in very, very large internet platforms,\n which have now suppressed the most powerful oil companies and have become gatekeepers for our freedom of opinion online.\n Yes, but they say that they can regulate themselves quite well, that they have ethical principles and that we should not think like that. Yes, so we believe ...\n So we're talking about Google, Facebook, Amazon ...\n Yes, exactly. If you look at it, then there have been strong monopolies.\n And users are in the situation of compulsion that they,\n if they want to use Facebook, they also have to agree to the Facebook AGB.\n And our position is that it cannot be without free consent if you are simply excluded from the Soros platform.\n That is why it is very necessary that there is now a stronger regulation that, for example, obliges platforms that they are not allowed to make the use of their platform dependent on it.\n That users agree to such an invasive tracking and then advertise it,\n that all the data collected about you is processed to make it a very targeted advertising.\n But you know that they will earn their money with it.\n Yes, that's clear.\n So you want to destroy the business model?\n Well, I personally wouldn't be able to do that, but in fact we are of the opinion that the business model...\n So Facebook only earns a few and ninety percent of the revenue from advertising. And as long as the business model continues to run so unregulated, I think it's extremely unlikely that you can do anything about this massive data collection of companies.\n The cool thing is that when I use Facebook, Facebook evaluates how I behave, when I click on what, how long I need to type something, what I'm looking for, and create a profile from that how I could behave in the future.\n And this profile, this behavior, this behavior requirement is sold to the customers.\n Not the data itself, but sometimes a misunderstanding, so to speak, the access to your virtual identity, to your person, the access to you, that is sold.\n And with that they steal my own data, because the data is my behaviour.\n Exactly. They say a lot about you and that's why they are so valuable.\n There is currently an attempt to regulate this on a European level.\n There are especially the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act in discussion at the moment.\n And they are trying to accept this problem and we are very hopeful that this could lead to a European way that is a bit more exemplary and that companies take it more seriously.\n There are a few promising approaches, but they don't go far enough.\n Let's start with your approach. You already mentioned Jojana Suboff, she's against us splitting up Facebook, Amazon and Co.\n Because then you have even more players to fight with.\n We're not an anti-cartel organization per se, but a human rights organization. That means we are semi-neutral about whether there is a kind of need for split-up.\n What is needed is, keyword interoperability, that means, regardless of whether you split up something or not, that you ...\n We have a so-called network effect, that means you are in the network where your friends are, otherwise it doesn't make sense. If you are alone in a super privacy-friendly network with two other people, that's not attractive for you.\n But if it were possible to interact with Facebook from a network that protects your privacy much better, for example.\n Or to write a Twitter message or post something on Instagram.\n Then you would find it more attractive to choose this entry point.\n And the problem is that this interoperability,\n that you can still interact with the people in a different network from a competitor,\n is practically not possible, because of course the networks are blocking each other.\n And that's something you could legally prescribe.\n So in practice I can't send an email to Google with my Facebook Messenger?",
      "We are just complex and comfortable beings.\n But I'm really not\n there to\n shun individual users.\n Because life is exhausting enough\n without being\n tormented by your privacy\n on Facebook for hours.\n It's really the responsibility of the government\n to intervene in a regulated manner.\n Then there was the question of how much do you estimate the risk that authoritarian surveillance states,\n such as China, which then have the appropriate technology,\n can also use these for surveillance and control purposes in other regions in Europe,\n also in Germany, without us being able to defend ourselves against it.\n That definitely happens, that surveillance, data flows are global.\n If I send an email to Frankfurt, it can still be that it is led across the\n globe, because that is the fastest connection.\n And of course there is the risk that someone will catch up on the way.\n So that's the problem, that digital communication does not keep to the limits.\n The chances are the problem.\n So yes, and how do you prevent that?\n Now you say again, there are companies and you can control them. But isn't that a bit like, so to speak, the police sometimes say when it comes to the topic of housing and car crashes,\n yes, yes, yes, basically we are always two steps behind the bad guys, the criminals. Is that also the case here?\n We are probably criminals, the police knows better than I do, maybe a few steps behind.\n We are definitely always two to twenty to two hundred steps behind in technical development. That's quite clear.\n Can this be turned around?\n Yes.\n How?\n We are trying to do that in the European Union, for example, to bring in the internet giants with the DSA and the DMA through regulatory legislation.\n This is possible. The General Data Protection Regulation has shown that this is basically possible. They stick to it.\n A completely different topic complex. Amnesty International is the foundation of the relationship between attention and support for political prisoners.\n How far has this actually become a topic or in the background\n in an increasingly global and partially transparent communication society?\n I'm not sure if I understood what you meant by partially transparent communication society, but I answer it and you can tell me if it was a good answer or a sufficient answer.\n This is still a very important component of our work.\n We start with an average of two to three of these urgent actions, where we ask the network of over 165,000 people to send urgent calls to the respective government.\n Approximately two to three a week.\n As I said, 35 percent of them are also successful.\n And that is still an important component of our work.\n But of course we then recognized, building on this work for individuals who are inundated or persecuted,\n or are being persecuted for their wrongdoing, that you also have to address the structural problems.\n And that's why we also work very hard in the area of standard setting,\n for example legislation, new UN agreements and the like,\n to make it strong for that,\n so that what changes the structures,\n it becomes more unlikely that we will have to write these letters all the time.\n Also there, question, specific case, the Belarusian blogger who was taken out of a plane in Kiev, in Kiev, nonsense, in Minsk, with his partner.\n Sofia Sapega.\n Yes. Have you done anything about it? What do you continue to do?\n Within 24 hours we started a so-called urgent action,\n that people around the world use an urgent appeal for their release.\n First for his immediate release and the release of Sofia Sappega, his girlfriend. And secondly... Who will be directed these appeals?\n I mean, the government in Belarus is going to get a beating, right?\n We'll see if they get a beating.\n Ultimately, the possibilities of civil society are the possibilities that civil society has.\n And since we achieve success with a third of these appeals,\n it is not that the world would be\n fundamentally indifferent, the government would be indifferent if they noticed that the world is looking at us.\n And getting a lot of letters is just annoying and it doesn't feel so nice.\n And we know that we have success with it, but in some cases it is of course more promising than in others.\n Then there was also the question, you hear so little, you then addressed it,\n the question came in earlier, from the situation of the Uyghurs. Do you do less or is\n that only in international communication and reporting a little bit\n backwards? I haven't done a press release on it."

However, as the geopolitical landscape changed, the primary focus shifted toward training and collaboration with NATO allies.

      "Thank you. We're going to talk in part two.\n Thank you, Tilo.\n Let's talk about some cultural differences between Germany and America.\n You said you were living in Germany\n before you got ambassador. What did you learn from the country before you became the ambassador?\n Well, you learn almost instantly that there's an enormous friendship and relationship between\n Germany and America and that we're a lot more alike than we are different.\n Are we?\n Yeah, I think there's no question. And there are a couple reasons for that. First of all, if you look at the American population, there are about\n 313 million Americans. The biggest single block of heritage or hintergrund in America is German.\n Really? Yeah. So that's, people will give you very different estimates, 40, 50, 60, 70 million,\n you hear those numbers thrown around. So we literally are like\n each other for good reason. Secondly, because of the very unique history of Germany in the second\n half of the 20th century, we have had millions of members of our military and their families\n living in Germany since World War II. The estimate is over 16 million.\n So you've got all these...\n Yeah, you've got all these Americans with meaningful history in Germany, in our military.\n We used to have dozens of America houses.\n So we know each other really well.\n There aren't a lot of surprises.\n What is an American house? America house was a phenomenally successful notion during, broadly speaking,\n the Cold War.\n These were open, basically, institutions around Germany.\n There was a very famous one in West Berlin.\n And you could go in and they would put on programs to tell you about what was going\n on in America.\n You could read about America.\n There were libraries, showed movies.\n They did a lot of cultural stuff.\n So it was a way to give Germans a real sense of what America was about.\n So as I say, I think there aren't a whole lot of surprises.\n You know, cuisine may be a little bit different.\n Is there anything you like? German?\n German cuisine? I'll tell you what. Some schnitzel? Yeah, yeah. We love schnitzel. Our kids, if you\n say to our kids, okay, let's have some special meals this week, what will they do? They'll have,\n they'll ask for schnitzel. In the winter, it's not German, but we do it a lot more here than we do it\n back home. We do some fondue. And the big one is on Sunday,\n we just did this Sunday, I ran the half marathon with my wife, Weisswurst and Weissbier.\n You ran?\n I ran. And my wife did as well.\n Did you finish?\n Absolutely. Best time we've ever had, I might add, with great...\n Tell me about it.\n 1.57, 28. And remember, don it. 157, 28.\n And remember, don't lie.\n You remember Paul Ryan?\n I can't.\n This is stuff you can look up these days, man.\n You can't do that.\n I think 157, 28.\n Not bad.\n Which for us, first time.\n It's the third half marathon.\n We've run one full, three halves.\n It's our best time.\n Very happy.\n Not bad, not bad.\n But we came back to the house, took a shower, had Weisswurst and Weissbier. How do you like that? I love it.\n We love it. Our kids love it. Get that sweet mustard, fantastic. You can hunt me\n with that. Okay, I won't, I won't, next time you come over I won't serve it, I\n promise. Okay, you were mentioning the military, the American military, is it still here in Germany?\n Yes, they are, but not in Berlin.\n Why is that?\n Different reason than it used to be.\n It used to be, obviously, we were here in the Cold War to protect Western Europe,\n to protect Germany in case of an invasion.\n Today, god sei dank, we're here for different reasons.\n What are these reasons?\n The reasons really are to train with our allies and to get to know each other better in an environment, in a safe environment like Germany,\n so that when we have to go to places like Afghanistan together, and we have thousands of U.S.",
      "This American exceptionalism, foreign policy, democracy, where do they come from?\n Before this status as super power?\n When it was after that? Because of course you have to reason the foreign policy differently.\n Against the American people. Why do we help there now?\n And go in there and intervene there and wage war there and defend there. Yes, so you're now talking about the role of America after the Second World War.\n And that is of course, especially from a German perspective, quite blatant.\n So the Allies come in here, your grandparents must have a story to it.\n They have Soviet stories. Okay, good.\n But some say, they always gave us chewing gum.\n Or my mother had to, because the Americans wanted it,\n took a body to another story.\n They did that as part of the de-Nazi-ization.\n That they demanded that the population looks at what the Nazis did.\n After the Second World War, the Americans did re-education in Germany, launched economic programs and also experienced a kind of milestone of nationalism. There were the American houses here, for example,\n which were also financed,\n which brought us closer to the American culture,\n which brought us closer to the American culture,\n which brought us closer to the American culture,\n which brought us closer to the American culture,\n which brought us closer to the American culture,\n which brought us closer to the American culture,\n which brought us closer to the American culture,\n which brought us closer to the American culture, which brought us closer to the American culture, The American Studies as an institution was also created after the Second World War.\n And yes, that's where it comes in quite strongly, that the Americanization of the world took place.\n And implicitly, of course, because they are the better system. At that time he had won the democracy against the national socialism and the dictatorship.\n There was something to it. But this ideology of exceptionalism, did that...\n That came very clearly in that time, also in scientific circles.\n And Lipset is one who also wrote a book about it in the 70s, a little later.\n There is also a small facet, I don't know if you can still do that much.\n Yes, sure. because this term of American exceptionalism was shaped in 1929 by a man named Lovejoy or something like that.\n And he was again the president, I think it was Stalin, why, in America, there is no socialism. from a russian perspective, the soviet union existed and people thought that other countries would be socialist,\n according to Karl Marx's logic.\n Proletarians of all the world unite you.\n Exactly, and that would also be a bit too much in other countries.\n And proletarians of other countries would prefer socialism.\n That didn't happen and that's why Mr. Lovejoy claimed that America is exceptional.\n Because it doesn't do what the Marxists did, which should happen everywhere.\n what should actually happen everywhere. And then, with this Marxist dimension, it will be understood later as the\n concept of the American and also the patriotic and nationalist. But... Who knows, maybe...\n No, I don't want to say that America is becoming socialist,\n that's not...\n to be taken.\n We'll see what Bernie will say about it, but...\n And what he understands from it.\n What he understands from it, yes.\n He's a democratic socialist, that's what he describes himself.\n The term Man destiny, I had it in school in my history book, but it was never really explained to us.\n You said it before, it probably had something to do with the Puritans and the first colonialists.\n Explain it to us, What does manifest destiny mean? Exactly.\n It's our task, our destiny, yes?\n Also in the positive, our mission, that we spread democracy in the world.\n Democracy?\n Yes.\n I also noticed that Manifest Disney was also like, okay, we have to fight the west,\n to settle the whole continent, because the whole continent has earned democracy and the American. Settler politics or also this killing of existing people\n was so legitimized that one has the task to spread civilization in the the continent in the west.\n So it's also another kind of supremacy idea.\n I mean, of course, if you practice violence, then you have to convince yourself that it has a reason why you have to do it.\n But there's always just colonial thinking behind it. We just want to have more land. Yes, whether people believed it themselves, that's up to them now."

      "Not all caregivers. That's the suggestion we're making now.\n But not the same money?\n No, that's true, but everyone gets something.\n But different?\n Yes. The nurses who worked in facilities, hospitals, who provided Covid, get something.\n And those who work in long-term care.\n The nurses who work in hospitals who have never participated in the Covid-19 care.\n They don't get a bonus.\n They didn't have any stress from Corona?\n They also had stress, that's not a question.\n But in some hospitals, many interventions simply failed,\n because the planned interventions didn't take place.\n That's also a stress now, when I have less work, but it's not the stress that should be rewarded by the bonus.\n So the situation is that the nurses who have been particularly stressed in the Covid-19 care, they get the money.\n You then differentiate between those who have worked in intensive care, regular care and long-term care.\n So I have three groups, if you like.\n And you can work with these three groups.\n We spend a total of 1 billion euros on this.\n But there is also money that is generated by the people who have received a gratification from the institution itself,\n from the hospital or from the nursing institution, or from the federal states,\n then we set these bonuses up to \u20ac 3,000 tax-free and with that they are also tax-free.\n But Karl, not all intensive care workers\n will get the bonus. I spoke to Ricardo Lange. It is a leasing health care provider. So without\n this leasing system in the health care, in the hospitals, the system would\n collapse now. It will go empty again. He asks you why. So the leasing nurses should normally be assigned to the hospitals where they worked.\n And so they would normally get the bonus. I'll make it simple.\n So it can't be found in your point of view? No, the money flows into the facilities and the facilities distribute the money to the nurses who have worked for them in the pandemic.\n And formally, the implementation, i.e. through the hospitals, is not explicitly excluded,\n that only those who can get the bonus can get it, who are employed there,\n but those who have worked there.\n What about people like the cleaning workers in hospitals?\n They have massive stress,\n are worried that hygiene regulations can be kept.\n They are now going out again.\n That's right.\n We are concentrating this one billion on the nurses, because they ...\n Then make two billion out of it, three billion.\n Yes, that is not to be decided by me.\n But you can demand.\n There is this saying, anything we can do we can afford.\n Everything we want to do we can afford.\n Here you have to consider different roles.\n I am the one who represents the work of the government.\n And the journalist, so you can demand too, but I can't ask for myself.\n So you would wish that there was more money?\n Of course I would wish that there was more money, no question.\n And if it were like this, that we decide regionally, we do more, then I would be the one who distributes it.\n And don't you think that the bonus with a high value of 550 euros is a blank coin?\n That's not the highest value, but that's the value that is calculated for long-term care.\n For those who have worked in hospitals, for example at the intensive care unit,\n Boni will come out of significantly more than 2000 euros, of course.\n The lack of staff during the pandemic in the care system has still intensified.\n It's actually amazing, a crisis is there and we're not doing anything about it, it's even getting worse.\n The Merkel government has missed a kind of national mobilization strategy.\n In the war this also happens, the pandemic is also an exceptional situation.\n Why didn't you set up a national mobilization strategy\n so that we can safely care for people in the future?\n I am currently working with the specialists in care\n together on a law that is about\n documenting the blatant lack of staff in the nursing home,\n in order to gain and establish more nursing staff on that basis.\n This morning I had, I think, about one and a half hours with representatives of the German Board of Care,\n Verdi, the German Hospital Association, the top association of the health insurance.\n They all tear up your health insurance bonus.\n This morning it wasn't like that, to be honest.\n We discussed this morning for a long time, but it wasn't the case.",
      "And certainly, I'm with you, it would make sense to take a few marks\n and say, watch out, they won't tell you much, there's a bonus X. Now you can\n see how it is justified. Of course, it is not always justified when I have an intensive care nurse\n who really does ECMO treatment and I have a nurse in the hospital who maybe has few or no corona patients and both get the same bonus.\n You would also ask yourself, is that still fair? So basically I'm both.\n And the care bonus that is now being discussed, you go to the vaccination center for four hours, then you have it out. You have it out. So without question, if you put these individual parameters together, then there are\n inconsistencies.\n I just don't think it's the point that you point to the ones that work in the vaccination center,\n but rather the question of why is that the legislator, who on the one hand throws out money for\n some, in my view, nonsense things nonsense things and now tell the civil tests where we probably burn billions. That money would certainly be\n made more useful in the nursing home. No question.\n Let's come to your role in the pandemic. Have you somehow continued to educate yourself in the last three years\n that you have an idea and express yourself to the pandemic?\n So I do it like Karl Lauterbach. I read a lot of studies.\n Are you also an epidemiologist?\n No, I'm not an epidemiologist, but I'm a\n tested doctor and I'm a writer.\n And Karl Lauterbach is also not a virologist.\n But do you know anything about epidemiology?\n Epidemiology has nothing to do with epidemics, as we know,\n but with the occurrence of diseases in a population.\n In this respect, you may not know, I was the chairman of the Central Institute for Medical Care for a few years.\n This is nothing more than an institute that deals with epidemiology.\n And yes, I have actually read studies in the last three or especially studies that I had never read before. I had studied before that affected my subject and now I have to study about virus loads, about test procedures.\n That's exciting, I wouldn't have let myself dream.\n And in that respect, yes, I have read a lot.\n I still wouldn't assume that I am a virologist. Not everything, but a lot. I'm not a virologist.\n You can get into it, but I don't have to understand the virological or the vaccine-based, but I have to know how to interpret numbers.\n How did you come to that? March 2020, almost two years ago, you once said that Covid-19 is more of a medical-related infection.\n Would you say that again today?\n I think that at the time the statement was basically correct.\n As I said, we had 823 cases in Germany and the news was full of it.\n Interestingly, I was in China at the beginning of January when it broke out in Wuhan.\n In China you didn't hear anything. Nothing. No word.\n I called from Germany and said, what's going on in China with this lung disease?\n Lung disease here in China? We know nothing. And we were with a medical delegation.\n So then we come back and we had a meeting at that time when when we asked ourselves how we would deal with this Corona topic.\n Nobody knew what was waiting for us.\n In the meeting in the Ministry of Health, the question was what we could do.\n We also agreed with the RKI at that time.\n We tried to regulate certain things, because we had no experience with the pandemic and no one in charge of it. And at that time, everyone was really lamenting about it.\n And they told me, if you look at the numbers,\n it's not like we have a huge number of infected people at the moment.\n It's actually, and in that respect it may sound a bit flabby,\n but it was actually like that when you looked at the media coverage.\n And what really happened medically at that time,\n then it was a considerable discrepancy.\n So you don't just do statements on a daily basis?\n That was on a daily basis at that time.\n And I want to see who said, I know what it looks like.\n I think we all have a good idea of what happened and how long it happened and how we deal with it.\n But that's exactly the point. You've always done that."

This led to a decrease in the number of refugees entering the country, from around 450,000-490,000 in 1992 to approximately 80,000 in 1996.\n\nShe also highlighted the issue of the \"open financial questions\" resulting from the unification process, which made it challenging to determine the rightful owners of properties and assets in the former East Germany. These challenges were further exacerbated by the fact that the property law had to be negotiated within the coalition, leading to lengthy discussions and debates.\n\nAnother controversial aspect discussed by Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger was the proposed expansion of the surveillance powers of the state. She opposed the idea of storing all citizens' data for extended periods without a clear reason, arguing that it would infringe upon individual privacy rights. Instead, she advocated for targeted surveillance based on specific evidence or suspicion of criminal activity.",

      "So you had to get that done very quickly.\n That went well, there were definitely some who had also pre-states.\n Of course, there weren't that many women in the resort.\n That has gradually become a little better.\n But that's the most important time.\n I had no idea what was on the agenda.\n I knew the coalition treaty, but I didn't have it under my pillow every day.\n After the motto, what do I have to do now?\n And then comes a lot of current things.\n We always had to deal with organized crime, crime prevention laws, all those things.\n Then, of course, there was also asylum law, which was a huge topic.\n Because in 1992 the asylum basic law was changed.\n Because at that time we had refugee numbers, they were around 450,000-490,000.\n And that was also a very difficult situation at that time.\n In any case, especially also by CSU companies,\n that you actually do everything from the top, but it wasn't called that way.\n It didn't work like that and then the basic right to asylum was changed, also significantly restricted.\n Did you participate?\n That was primarily CDU and SPD, but also the FDP participated because it was a constitutional change.\n So the SPD had to participate, that was Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at the time, with whom I could also conduct a few negotiations.\n Why did you participate?\n We participated because we were once in the coalition.\n We have some things, I still remember, I did not agree with everything.\n There were airport procedures, a very accelerated procedure.\n I didn't participate.\n That was difficult, of course. For some we got more out, in the sense of state guarantees.\n There were much more proposals than the ones that are in now,\n but which are now also already significantly affecting.\n But today nobody talks about the restricted asylum and basic rights.\n Today you have to listen carefully.\n When someone says, we need the basic rights,\n because some say, we can't do it, it's enough, let's cancel the Geneva Convention on Refugees, we don't need more.\n And then we can decide here, as far as possible, according to the measure.\n So, a wide decision-making authority, should he come or not, will he get a right or not.\n So, nobody is talking about what it was then.\n Of course, we have asylum rights in the core there.\n And you can't go any further in my opinion.\n It's not different.\n But that was a big deal, you have to say.\n But we didn't have this controversial discussion among parties,\n because CDU, SPD, FDP were for it, the Greens were against it.\n But they weren't strong.\n They didn't have a large faction.\n They were just the, in quotation marks, the B\u00fcndnis 90 from the new federal states.\n And of course there were the Republicans.\n But unlike the AfD, they didn't manage to really get their feet on the subject.\n Not even with the topic, although they had already used exactly this topic back then.\n What was the first law that you brought to the table as Justice Minister? Well, that was the unity that happened one and a half years before.\n I had long negotiated on it.\n The property law.\n How do you deal with property, with the housing, with the property,\n which was lost in the GDR because it people because it was taken by the state.\n They moved somewhere else or when a family member had applied for a leave of absence,\n then they suffered under repression.\n And there were so many so-called open financial questions through the unit.\n Insanely complicated. The Dutch, this weekend house, which was a piece of freedom for the people in the GDR,\n they were out of their environment, they could move freely, celebrate, do what they wanted.\n Yes, it was really complicated, because it didn't fit into our system, because the reason didn't belong to them,\n but the building, the Dutch, so many questions that affected all people in a very immediate way.\n What conditions can they stay in? Does it belong to them? Can they buy it?\n How long do they have time to decide? So really what makes life happen.\n And that was my first draft law. And we negotiated for a long time,\n so we had a lot of big negotiations\n with all sorts of initiatives from the GDR,\n which came from the early GDR,\n which all signalled their own practices.\n We didn't know that.",
      "And then the debate started in the coalition,\n because then the Union said,\n yes, the law is constitutional,\n they had participated themselves,\n but we can do something, we can make a new law, just like the constitutional court wants.\n And you say, no.\n Then I said, well, of course, we're not making a law at all.\n Unintentional immediate data storage is, in my eyes, really something that doesn't work politically and is very questionable in terms of legal and political reasons, because it doesn't mean that a specific group of people with specific suspicions,\n i.e. the group that is planning to attack or is always in an environment around a museum\n that is always being observed, they will agree to attack.\n With one occasion I can probably raise information,\n I have surveillance options.\n But without a reason, where there is no such reason, from all citizens,\n all data is stored for six months or however long,\n in other countries six months, in other countries 24 months.\n 24. So I said, that's too far. I don't do it just for a reason,\n if at all, but not without a reason.\n I don't want and don't want to see people sending an SMS,\n calling, sending an email, that they always have in mind\n that everything I do here, not the content, but the receiver, the number,\n the device from my device, everything on technical data is saved,\n and then it can be accessed under certain conditions, but then everything is saved.\n My entire communication behavior is saved technically.\n Sabine, I'm innocent. I'm not a terrorist, I'm not doing anything, I don't care.\n No, quite the opposite. I find a dumber saying than, I have nothing to hide, I don't care. No, quite the opposite. I find a more stupid saying than\n I don't care, I don't have to hide it,\n it doesn't exist.\n Because the state has no right\n to learn anything from me\n what I do.\n Where do I get there?\n I am a private person.\n I behave, I talk to whoever I want,\n I behave the way I want,\n I communicate with whoever I want. The state doesn't care about that.\n That's my private sphere that doesn't care about anything.\n Of course, many have always told me, yes, a taxi driver always says,\n yes, I'm not a criminal, I don't do anything here, they can know everything about me.\n Well, and then they sit at home, for example, when a flat is being monitored,\n and think with their wife, how can we maybe use a few taxi bills for the tax return, then they sit there, drink their fifth beer and enjoy it properly and curse at their neighbors.\n Does anyone care about that? Do you think it's great if it's found somewhere? Or I call the anonymous alcoholics five times, or at Weight Watchers or something. Does anyone care about that? Does someone have to know? Can someone know? No.\n So for me, that's private, it's not possible.\n And then we had a permanent issue in the coalition,\n because there was no coalition discussion,\n so right-wing politicians also have a coalition discussion about their issues,\n we always agree on this in the Ministry of Justice,\n and there was no conversation without being asked,\n how far are you with the innocent preliminary statement?\n When will the draft come? We have to present some key points.\n I said, I won't do that. I gave a report to the Max Planck Institute in Freiburg\n for international and for criminal law, international and European.\n I said, make a real investigation\n what this reckless fraudulent information actually brings for more security.\n So interrogate police, civil servants, judges.\n Because we had a time when we had the fraudulent information\n and now we don't have the time.\n And then it's right-wing.\n They conducted a conducted many interviews,\n published a big study,\n and they said the rate of education\n has increased by 0.01%\n due to the pre-trial storage.\n So there was no argument for that.\n No argument for that.\n And therefore,\n I never said that\n it is not possible to gain\n a knowledge in a situation where a child pornography is discovered.\n But the question is, do I do it without any reason for everyone?\n That all people in these files, which we know, also access completely different ones,\n where we don't think they access them and where we say they are not allowed to."

He was really an eclectic scientist. He still lives.\n What is that then?\n Someone who puts together his thoughts from very different directions.\n He had some Austrian components, especially when he analyzed the labor market.\n That was very interesting. He had some political ideas, partly Hayekian, and on the other hand he relied a lot on Keynes.\n And this combination of Keynes and Austrian school is not found so often.\n You still find them today at Karl Christian von Weizs\u00e4cker, for example, but otherwise very, very little. And of course, even in the research at that time, it was not as methodically shaped as it is today.\n Or how I got to know it over my doctoral studies over time.\n And someone like Werner Pomerene may have started as a Keynesian-oriented, but that was actually not the case anymore. But that wasn't really it. It was very pragmatic and interested in political economy and investigated the inclinations of politicians and the like.\n How did you start before we talk about where you are now?\n What do you mean by started?\n You mean the one is ... As I said, I come from a traditional SPD family and I was interested in what the state can do to reduce unemployment.\n That's what we've already mentioned.\n But then I gained the impression in my studies, through this diversity of different impressions, that it's too simple, that it doesn't work.\n And then I didn't become more active in this party political work.\n I was still in a legislative period in a municipal parliament\n and when the legislature was over, I didn't get involved anymore.\n So I was once at a congress of the young socialists of the Saarl\u00e4ndische.\n I found that, even at that time,\n far from what was taught to us in the study,\n far from what was taught to us in the study,\n in economic context.\n This contradicted everything that we were presented with\n empirically in the study.\n The most sensible in that time was Heiko Maas,\n whom I met there.\n Our foreign minister now?\n Yes.\n Who did you meet?\n He was...\n Through the SPD?\n Yes, through my SPD membership at that time at this congress of the young socialists.\n And then on the other hand we met again and again in the same building,\n because the economists and lawyers had lectures in the same building at the university in Saarbr\u00fccken, building 16.\n How would you describe your thought building today?\n Liberal.\n Ordo-liberal, neo-liberal?\n Yes, it is strongly economically organized.\n I already put a rule of thumb on what concerns economic policy and think that rule of thumb is the right thing to do.\n What does that mean?\n That means that the state, with its economic policy, above all, sets the framework conditions.\n That it does not try to intervene in market events in such a way that it sets the result.\n For example, in the form of minimum wages or rent caps and the like.\n I am always a bit more skeptical about subsidies.\n This is also an immediate intervention in the market situation by supporting companies immediately.\n And I ask, especially in macroeconomics, how do you manage to get good results with institutional framework conditions?\n How should they be designed?\n What is the difference between an ordo-liberal and a neo-liberal?\n That's not that easy, because the word neo-liberalism\n comes from the discussions that were conducted in the 1930s.\n That's where it comes from.\n But today it might have a different meaning.\n Exactly. It was shaped in the past in a way that was different from the classical liberalism\n of the 19th century. By authors that we consider to be ordo-liberal today. Alexander R\u00fcstow\n shaped this word on the Colloque of Liebmann, for example, and made it very clear that\n it was about this separation.

      "You don't keep that many sentences from your studies.\n But the one sentence that I always found central for me personally,\n what is actually the definition of market economy?\n Market economy, as the Secretary of State once wrote, is an order\n in which everyone can stand up every morning and do something different than before.\n And the rule tries to make it better than before.\n You are an economist.\n Economist, that's the main study, but I also studied history.\n What is a scientist?\n So now let's get to your institute. What is a science about it?\n Let's get to your institute. Is it a common interest association?\n Where does your money come from? Who are your customers?\n At the beginning, explain the difference between a free market economy and a social market economy.\n There is a free market economy somewhere.\n Where does the most social market economy in the world rule?\n That means competitiveness.\n Is tax evasion part of the market economy? Is the unconditional basic income\n compatible with social market economy?\n We already have minimum wages.\n Do we need maximum wages?\n Which parties represent your view?\n What is a market-conforming democracy?\n So, a new episode of Jungen Naiv.\n We are in Berlin. Who are you?\n Michael H\u00fcther, I am the director of the German Institute for Economy. We are actually in Cologne, but also in Berlin, with ten employees, and two in Brussels, another office.\n Michael, before we get to your institute, who are you, what did you do before? I always covered my path with secondary topics or stepped on them.\n I was interested in economics, but before that I was interested in history.\n And that's why I studied history and economics in parallel.\n Today you can combine something like that in the course of study.\n It didn't work out at the time I was studying.\n And yes, that brought me to the board of directors first.\n I was a scientific employee there, then a general secretary.\n What does that mean? Well, there are directors who are in charge of the scientific staff.\n Because you know the board of directors better under five ways.\n They write a report once a year for the federal government.\n You were there?\n So the five ways, those are the professors who were appointed by the federal government,\n they had staff of employees and I led them.\n And that was a great way to start a life after university,\n because on the one hand it put all the questions of economics and politics on the table.\n So you really had to express yourself on the topics that are relevant now.\n And you had to do the second thing in a way that everyone on the street who is not an economist understands.\n That's the challenge. And that was pretty early.\n And then you have to do it in a way that you don't turn around on the seventh floor in mathematical models,\n but in the understanding of the world as it is.\n And that helps you to think from a historical perspective.\n And then, after I was there for eight years, I became chief tax officer at a bank in Frankfurt,\n the DK Bank, which is a top institution of the tax office organization.\n That was completely different again.\n You had to think about what information you could offer those who do business in the bank,\n for example, assess credit risks or in which economic areas it is worth investing\n and what contribution a bank can make with its investment strategies for customers.\n So, I did that for five years because the was the chief work clerk of this bank, also responsible for communication.\n Then I was called up to be director of the IW Cologne and I've been doing that for 12 years now.\n For 12 years?\n Yes, that's been the longest time. Before that, all my professional positions were always four to five years.\n Without it being planned, it was always a natural inner clock.\n I was a normal employee for four years at the board of directors, a general secretary for four years, chief civil servant for almost five years.\n And then I had the great opportunity to take over this institute management.\n And these are temporary contracts, but so far they have been considered to be quite good.\n You are an economist?\n Economist, that is the main study, but I also studied history.\n What is a science?\n Well, you try to understand real problems that, for example, are shown in the labor market through unemployment, first to understand, theoretically to penetrate.\n And science always means to present it on a general level."

    "response": "\nPharmacies in Germany have significant influence in the healthcare system due to their strong lobbying power and specific regulations. They enjoy a monopoly on selling prescription-free drugs, which must be purchased exclusively from pharmacies. This unique situation exists only in Germany within Europe. Pharmacies have demonstrated successful lobbying skills, often engaging in one-on-one consultations with local politicians. This has led to restrictions on shipping pharmacies, which are seen as a threat by traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies. These restrictions are not based on medical or security reasons but rather stem from the business interests of local pharmacists.",

      "You said they have a special power in our system.\n Not only in ours, generally. That applies to all health systems.\n But now let's get to the German. What power, what role do the doctors play? I also think of the Marburger Bund, which is probably two different things. The Marburger Bund is actually a medical association for the stationary care.\n They have a very high influence, also on the medical budgets.\n All medical associations, there are others like Hartmannbund, which are more or less the same.\n Their importance is taken away.\n But the health insurance association, they have already, they determine the whole structure of the ambulant care.\n That is also a legal order. Health insurance associations are a body of the public law.\n Otherwise, of course, the doctor's job is a highly respected job in the population and it also results in a certain power.\n It is also the case that many doctors, functionaries, especially themselves, are sorry that doctors and nurses are not particularly capable of organizing. This also results from their profession.\n They are actually more of a single fighter. So the level of organization is not particularly high.\n So, for example, the medical room has little influence.\n They have important internal tasks.\n They take care of the pension fund for doctors.\n Doctors are not employees in the general pension insurance,\n but they have their own supply chain, as well as lawyers.\n They also take care of the standards in the supply, but they are actually also regulated more and more in the joint federal committee.\n This joint federal committee is also called the small legislator, because it is actually determined there which services the health insurance companies pay everything that is medically necessary and corresponds to the standard of medical science.\n Almost literally, that's what the law says.\n But it doesn't say what it is individually, that would be nonsense.\n Because then you would have to change the law with every medical innovation that is on the market.\n And that takes at least one or two years. That would be nonsense. That's why you have the so-called NICE in England, which stands for National Institute for... I don't remember.\n They also determine what the National Health Service pays, i.e. what services it provides.\n And that was also the role model for the joint federal committee. and there are, I said this earlier, the associations of health insurance companies,\n health care doctors and hospitals, the German Health Association.\n And if there is now a new medical care or, where it is even more important,\n sometimes new medicine is on the market, which is also approved,\n then it is decided that the health insurance company pays for it.\n The new medicine that comes on the market does not mean that it will bring additional benefits.\n An extra institute, the ICWIC, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Sciences,\n is then determined on the basis of international literature whether this is a medical progress yes or no and then it is still considered is that not only a medical progress but is that also cost effective compared to previous methods and then\n is said okay if that is this modest positive effect then they are also paid by the health insurance company\n there are already some preparations through fallen where it was simply said that was the\n so-called me to preparations so meers. So am I. Coupines?\n Yes, they make some kind of molecular variations.\n The whole development of pharmaceutical innovation is a race of rats.\n That means there are all following. There are also certain areas, especially in oncology and neurology, these are the fields where the pharmaceutical industry invests a lot of money\n to develop new preparations. They don't do everything themselves,\n they also apply to university institutes or others for that.\n But there are still monopoly gains to be gained if you are the first to have win this race. And the others also research in the area, yes, they have some basic knowledge, they already know where it should go, but they have\n just shortened the patent application, so to speak. And then they try\n to do that somehow through any other variations. But this is now also,\n this MeToo preparation has been pushed forward quite a bit,\n also now because they have to be tested precisely, also at cost-doubts efficiency.\n And then, if the drugs are then also approved for the health insurance companies, so to speak, the manufacturers can\n ask for practically every price in the first year, which is what they think is right. There are\n these thousand dollar pills against hepatitis c, which also went through the press, where\n moon prices were really demanded and after year, the health insurance companies can then negotiate the price with them.",
      "So they earn, some nurses earn more.\n And the main problem is the issue of insurance.\n They have very high insurance costs.\n Otherwise I don't want to say anything more about it.\n I can also justify that.\n I have never been active there, but I am a member of the\n Secretariat between the Health Insurance and the Heberman Association.\n That's why I want to hold back.\n It is a problem because in general, for example, we have in Germany three times as many imperial cuts as in other comparable countries.\n And that also depends on the organization in the hospitals.\n Certainly also partly with the wishes of the mothers themselves that they want to have a punctual birth.\n But these are things, there is a lot in the eye. And what about the role of the pharmacies in our system? Is that okay? How does it work?\n The pharmacies probably have the best-performing lobby in Germany.\n You just have to say that. Why?\n They have a monopoly in certain areas, which is unique in Europe.\n For example, aspirin.\n So normal, prescription-free drugs can only be sold in pharmacies.\n I can't buy them in the supermarket.\n Excuse me?\n I can't buy them in the supermarket.\n No, that's unique in Germany.\n We always thought that...\n Unique in Europe or in the world?\n In Europe, right?\n So also in other countries, at least in drugstores in England, you can buy these drugs for free.\n How do they do it?\n They just go through with it. That's their political lobby.\n And they are very clever, because they do a lot on site.\n They don't do a big buhai in Berlin,\n but they do a kind of\n one-to-one consultation with local members of parliament.\n They put pressure on it.\n But was it always like that, that the pharmacies had such a lobby?\n Yes, they actually always had one, although in the past they still had a much stronger position.\n There was a time in the 50s, 60s, when the number of pharmacies was incredibly limited.\n Whoever had a pharmacy there had had the license to print money.\n And that has changed in the 60s, I think.\n And since then, we have a huge over-office.\n Go up and down the Kentstra\u00dfe, there is a pharmacy in every third house.\n There are also many medical practices, so it's getting a bit of a mess here.\n But the German pharmacy system has already done a very successful lobbying work.\n However, there are also many smaller pharmacies that actually have too little to live and too much to die for.\n But for example the fight to restrict shipping pharmacies.\n In the country, this is partly no longer possible to ensure.\n This is scandalous for me, this ban or restriction of shipping pharmacies.\n There are no medical or other security reasons\n to restrict this somehow. It is only the business interests of the pharmacists who, by the way,\n do this shipping business locally themselves. They don't want to have any big competition from any\n Dutch Doc Morris or anything else. They want to have their small protected areas.\n There are also several among pharmacists who own three or four pharmacies.\n But they are really very successful there, you have to say.\n Can you do something about it? Not electing the FDP has always been a bit more careful, but also in the Union.\n That goes across all parties.\n SPD and the Greens probably less.\n But I partly don't understand why, for example, the SPD has now agreed that with the shipping pharmacies,\n that it will come back into the coalition agreement.\n I just don't understand that.\n Do you have any hope now, we're slowly coming to the end, with a health minister, Jens Spahn?\n Do you see him as a specialist politician? Does he know what he's talking about?\n Since Seehofer, Spahn has been the first health minister who know what was coming at him when he took office.\n Ulla Schmidt came from pension politics, which was completely different.\n But in politics you think that pension, health insurance, everything is the same.\n We always forget that it is the control of an economic branch and not just about distributing money.\n And also with Andrea Fischer, the predecessor of Ulla Schmidt, she also came from the pension.\n Ulla Schmidt did the only right thing at the time, she went into cover first and let herself be briefed by her people for a year.\n What happened then? She was tough."

It's constantly this\n just that you just...\n We also have cartel offices and they should also\n go against monopoly and oligopoly.\n Of course.\n What they don't do is that they let everyone\n and everyone discuss.\n That's the argumentation\n of the Chinese leadership. If we do that,\n we'll never get to the end.\n So, that's something we don't like and don't think is right.\n And probably we have to...\n But that's only formal with us, right?\n No, it's discussed for a very long time and very comprehensively.\n Not formally, I think.\n But at the end of the day, the lobbies that are involved, the ones that are mostly in the language of the people.\n That's true, but on the other hand, it's of course the case that the lobbies also bring people behind them.\n That they try to gain more, that they try to take the public in for themselves.\n That's a very complex process.\n And that's actually something, this civil society debate, which I still consider a great strength despite all the disadvantages.\n But maybe we should say, if I say to the Chinese, you need more co-determination,\n maybe we need another co-determination. Maybe we have to limit the time of co-determination.\n Maybe there has to be a point from which\n there is no longer discussion, but then it is implemented.\n Sometimes I think about it in Germany,\n conservative rights, even exploiting these co-determinations\n that we have, for example with things they don't want.\n Renewable and so on.\n There they have suddenly promoted a lot of co-determination,\n so that the angry citizens have the next wind. Maybe it would be a progress of co-determination, so that the angry citizens somehow have the next wind.\n Maybe it would be a progress of our democracies that one says for a certain period of time everyone and as many and as intensively as they want to talk with,\n but then there is a point of no return and then a decision is made and if it was wrong, then you can still elect the government, but you can't raise a claim, start a process again, and start a citizen initiative again.\n And with the Chinese it is certainly the case that you say you have to make it more open, you have to make it more transparent, you have to doing everything wrong.\n But that wasn't the case. And in fact they also questioned the most progressive cartel lawyers and that has been included in their legislation. Do you have to ask the Chinese what they think about Robert Habeck or the German government\n for example, abolishing Tenet or there are some other energy...\n No, the Chinese would say about the energy...\n We act communistic, you had to ask that.

There are areas where there is a lot of open and controversial discussion.\n But for example the topic of how to vote and how many parties are there and if the president is allowed to lift the constitution and now have a third term.\n These are taboos in the big platforms.\n In a restaurant, at the table, there is no one at all.

There was no big plan behind it.\n How old were you?\n 27.\n Oh.\n Yes.\n Did you just want to go on vacation?\n Yes, I went stay a little longer.\n What was so interesting about 1994 in Peking? So that Frank thinks, I'll stay.\n It was a society in its infancy and you could feel that in every corner. And that you can do a lot of things, that you can design.\n In football, you would say, play in the open space. And that was 1994. So you could feel that at every corner and at every end of this city.\n That you can build something there, that you can develop something.\n Now you say shock Tiananmen, what does that mean?\n Oh, that was the overthrow of the protest movement in 1989. And the square is called Tiananmen Square.\n Why was that a shock? For whom? For the system?\n For all people, of course. That was clear.\n It was a... I don't know why you have to ask the question that it's a shock, because it's actually a matter of course.\n People were shot down by tanks and that was of course a shock for the country.\n Why did people get up then?\n Originally it was an economic crisis with 30% inflation in 1988.\n And then the students sat on top and demanded more freedom, more\n demanded play space. Which you didn't get? Which you didn't get, at least not\n as you wanted. Has there been something like that since then? No. Why?\n That has to do with economic reasons, that there was never a big economic crisis afterwards.\n And the majority of people feel that their personal freedom is constantly increasing.\n And that's why there was no pressure in the bowl. At the end of last year, only a few days, when the protesters held up these white cards.\n But that was only a very small movement, if not in several cities.\n But otherwise, people are busy earning money, making sure that their children have a better education, to travel, to develop their personal freedoms.\n Was that also a movement for more co-determination.\n But it wasn't a constitutional movement for democracy in the narrow sense.\n You didn't wish to have our leader elected?\n That didn't play a central role. It was more about the question of more determination. It remained more vague.\n Basically, you wanted to determine more where it would go.\n Can young Chinese people learn something about the student movement from back then, if they wanted to?\n So could they read something about it in Chinese media or in the internet?\n Not in the censored media, but they could of course download a VPN channel, like many hundred million people do.\n And then they have access to all international media, also in Chinese language.\n That works.\n Do you also do research?\n Yes, sure.\n Is that difficult?\n No. Why?\n It's just a program, you press on and everything is fine.\n I think the least VPR users use it all the time, but we don't need it, do we?\n Exactly.\n Okay. You were 27, you stayed with your family?\n No, back then...\n You mean you went with your girlfriend?\n Yes, but that wasn't family yet. That was my girlfriend and family came much later. So children.\n Now you're almost 30 years old.\n Yes, exactly.\n Do you speak all Chinese fluently? No. My children laugh at me.\n I just got stuck at some point, so to speak.\n If you don't sit down every night and learn for three hours, you won't get any further at some point.\n And I prefer to drink a glass of wine in the evening.\n Do you speak Mandarin?\n Yes, most people speak Mandarin. There are basically only two major languages.\n That is Cantonese, which is spoken in the south, but the main language is Mandarin."

    "response": "\nDieter Nuhr believes that panic does not lead to effective solutions for climate change. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of rationality, knowledge, and reason to tackle the issue. According to him, it's not about pushing panic but rather focusing on understanding the complexity of the problem and finding ways to address it through collaboration and cooperation. He acknowledges that progress may seem slow but argues that significant strides have been made in recent years, particularly within the European Union.

      "No, I don't think panic at all. I thought that was one of her very stupid sentences.\n I want you to panic. That was a stupid sentence.\n That was a very stupid sentence.\n Why?\n Because panic is not a good advisor. It has never been.\n Panic leads to restlessness, to emotionalization and to hectic, unthought reactions.\n Panic was a very stupid word at this point.\n But she was 16, I think, when she said that. So in that so I wouldn't blame her for that.\n But I blame people who quote this sentence as being especially spiritual or good.\n But isn't she at a certain point, if you look at our previous climate protection measures, the politics, in the last 20, 30 years, we have acted in a different way than panic, but very subtly.\n Is that a call for action, a call for action, you also do call for action,\n isn't it justified to say, we have to put out panic?\n No, I don't think panic, I think we have to get active now,\n that's completely right.\n You shouldn't forget that in the last 40 years, in which allegedly nothing was done,\n firstly because the world was different than I grew up.\n So stunted, I grew up in the area of \u200b\u200binclusion of the Ruhr area.\n And the world was environmentally different that is not like\n if nothing had happened only you thought back then in national context you\n thought smaller the rivers the rivers exactly the one was a stunted hole when I grew up\n where you wouldn't have dared to keep your foot in Now the salmon are coming back. And it's not like nothing happened.\n The second thing is that it's not like the state of science\n would have always been like today.\n The doubts were bigger in the 80s, in the 90s.\n I remember that 12, 15 years ago the discussion\n came up that the earthworm stopped that there was this famous gap between I think 1995 and 2010\n where the earthworm did not go any further than in the models that was an essential point I think\n where many people have hooked and said that is that even true, what the climate scientists say?\n The scientific stand was not the way it is now in 2020, but it was a different one.\n And you had justified doubts to ask why, when all models predict that the world will get so much warmer,\n why is nothing happening in the last 15 years?\n And then they found out that this is due to the heat absorption capacity of the\n world's seas and that it was 2012 or what I don't know anymore if I didn't stop\n and that the heat dissipation then increased and so on but you can't do that\n as if you had all that you know today then 2008 knew or should have known it\n but it's about that greta says we should push panic because we just don't do enough.\n If you as a private person would spend as much money as you take in,\n then you would tell your manager, you tell me when I need shit.\n I don't need a manager.\n You know what I mean. It's not viable's no longer viable and we're consuming resources and energy.\n I got stuck with the term panic.\n I think the emotionalization of the topic is not good.\n I think we are only able to make such extensive changes with reason as those that are now necessary.\n So I think that only then will it be possible to do this with international cooperation.\n My only hope regarding this is that China will be able to drive the rest of the world into a climate-friendly future,\n when it's time. I have little hope that this will happen in the context of the current power situation\n in the world, that we can really achieve reasonable climate goals. It's crazy that we, or that you now have to wait for an authoritarian, dictatorial state,\n because our free democratic society cannot do that?\n It is indeed a big problem that authoritarian states are much more flexible in matters of control, that's for sure.\n But apart from that...\n They don't need a democratic base.\n It's not like nothing happened. A lot has happened in the last few years.\n We agree on that, but it's not enough.\n There is the Paris Climate Agreement. Whether that's enough or not will be shown. Just because there is an agreement doesn't mean that something is done against it. That is currently the criticism of all opposition parties except the AfD and all climate associations,\n that the federal government has signed this contract, but no measures.",
      "They don't give a shit if the world gets 3% warmer or not, because that won't change much about their survival.\n They have a completely different standard of living.\n If they had the same standard of life as we do, then we would\n consume the resources of six planets. Currently we consume three. We have to do it\n so that it ... There will be an adaptation process. Of course, that changes\n constantly. Of course. Sure. Yes, and then the panic comes into play again. We just can't do that.\n You can't get any faster with panic. Why should panic help?\n What's the use of panic? Why do you insist on panic?\n Panic in the sense of screaming.\n Screaming too loudly.\n But screaming will happen everywhere.\n Yes, but that's the point.\n Screaming is everywhere, people have been talking about it for 40 years.\n You also joined the Greens because of that.\n But it doesn't happen enough.\n We consume the world three times a year.\n We can't find a way to limit it all at once.\n We can decide that now. We decide that it has to go faster.\n I'm afraid the world doesn't care about it.\n I think that you have a dilemma from your position of power and what you know would be reasonable.\n And you think panic would help you to create a balance between this power and what is possible.\n That's not the case. I don't think panic will help us.\n Another example is with Corona. Two weeks ago Lothar Wieler, you probably know him from RKI,\n he also pushed panic in a press conference in Spain. He made this Dolomite comparison,\n where he said we're going to the Dolomites with 100 things and want to take a 30th turn with 100 things. That's actually also...\n Have panic, what we're doing is life-threatening.\n That's exactly the same thing. And that's what we've come to.\n It's the same thing with the population when pictures like that are used.\n I haven't really connected Lothar Wieler with panic.\n I see him sitting there quite calmly and use arguments. And I haven't seen him being turned around or anything.\n I bring panic with turning around in connection with...\n But Gritta doesn't turn around either, she just says...\n No, panic, the demand for panic includes the demand\n to go over the normal processes that are used for opinion-making and to go through an\n state of activism that blurs out counter-arguments, blurs out who is against,\n no longer allows, pushes everything aside that is somehow in the way. And of course you can want that.\n I don't think we can get to that point.\n I think we still have to count arguments in a democratic legal state.\n And I am very much attached to this form of civilisation.\n For me, panic is the opposite of civilisation.\n That means I have to talk to those who have a different opinion.\n But that still happens.\n It's just being driven by the immensity of the problem that many who have the knowledge still deny.\n If you notice that the EU has decided to become CO2 neutral by 2050, then that's a decision that would have been unthinkable ten years ago. Completely unthinkable.\n And that decision was made because reason has moved an incredible amount.\n Now let's go ten years further. Then other decisions will be made that will probably be far more sufficient. But it will not be the panic that brought us there,\n but the reason, the knowledge of arguments, the interaction of states. We are sitting here in an\n incredibly civilized process. Five years ago we talked about it, when the Brexit comes,\n what comes next, who goes next, Europe breaks apart. Now Europe is sitting there and is making such far-reaching decisions.\n I think we're in the process of achieving a lot with reason.\n That this might be perceived as insufficient.\n I can understand that.\n But you won't change that by saying that it's not enough, I'm going to turn it around now.\n You're probably right that the catastrophe has to happen first, until we really...\n That's my fear, yes.\n But that's shit, that we, even though we have the reason to know...\n You don't have to tell me that, you have to explain it to Mr. Bolsonaro and those who elect him.\n We can't just take over Brazil.\n No."

      "Now I noticed from Sarah Wagenknecht, a member of another faction, that her mandate is not in the center of the activity,\n if you look at how often she is in the Bundestag and there are no parliamentary votes.\n And when she is asked why she is not there at the meetings,\n it means that there are media appointments, broadcast recordings or public events in between.\n What do you say as the president of the Bundestag to such excuses?\n What do you say as the president of the Bundestag to such excuses? I find it difficult. I say this openly because of course the citizens have the claim that we give interviews, I do that too, or that you sit in a talk show,\n although I always say that I prefer debates in the Bundestag than in talk shows,\n because the diversity of arguments simply have to reflect themselves in this parliament and not only in talk shows.\n That's why I find it critical that in the end you don't exercise your mandate, which you have been elected by the citizens,\n that will harm all of us, I would say, all of us, because these examples are always mentioned,\n you do everything possible, you don't do your job, and I think that will not be fair to the majority or the very, very large part of the members of parliament,\n who are really on the move in their electorates, the whole weekend, at many clubs, are standing for speech and answer.\n We have 736 members, a big parliament,\n and the very, very most of them are really doing it\n so that they are on the road a lot,\n have a lot of appointments.\n And I think such examples always harm the view\n of the parliament first, but also the other members\n who simply do their job in parliament.\n But now you're the president. Can't you speak to Sarah or call her to order and say, come here more often?\n You imagine that I'm actually the one who can regulate the measures from the outside.\n No, unfortunately I can't. My orderly violence is the one that takes place during the session.\n I can practice it when I lead the session meeting, but I can't enter the mandate.\n Every member is free to practice his mandate.\n Let's say I'm a member of parliament again and I say, I don't give a shit, I'm not coming back, I'll stay at home.\n That means you can't do anything?\n No.\n No, really not.\n I can only withdraw money because he or she has to be included in the list.\n Of course, if someone is missing, he has withdrawals from his diets.\n It is also withdrawn directly from the federal administration. You don't have to transfer it, we do it automatically. So in this respect you have losses. But I can't say that I don't like it.\n You have to know how you execute your mandate. That's not good. But I can't do more.\n I don't have the authority to say that you have to participate in the session. Unfortunately not.\n Last question. Compared to other countries, it is also the case in Germany that you can be an official and at the same time a member of the executive committee and also a member of the executive committee.\n That is usually strictly separated in other countries.\n Do you think it's good that you can be a member of the executive committee and also a chancellor or a minister?\n I don't know.\n You should control the government.\n That's true, but we control ... We control, thank God.\n But you can't control yourself.\n Even if I go to my office.\n There are also parliamentarians who have to, when they are parliamentarians,\n because of their neutrality, they give everything away.\n They also give their mandate away.\n That's not the case with me either.\n I always have this spagat.\n Actually I should represent this house neutrally. But I am I am also elected member of the SPD for my electorate.\n And I also vote for it. And that's also difficult. You could think about it.\n But would you think about it? If you are the chancellor of the German state, you automatically switch from the Bundestag.\n On the other hand, it's also about the majority of the Chancellor at the end.\n There will be another Sozi after that, you know.\n Yes, he or she would follow suit.\n So you can think about it.\n So now Olaf could step back himself, right?\n Yes, there are also some members of parliament who do that.",
      "So where are changes happening in the department?\n You don't get that sometimes.\n There was also some feedback, and what I've been asking myself for years, since I've been following politics in the Bundestag,\n most of the committees are not generally public.\n Yes, of course there are a few, how do I say it, control committees, secret committees, but that's not possible.\n But most of them don't say anything against it happening publicly and that there is a transfer.\n The coalition members said they want to do it in the entire faculty committee, but it depends on the majority of the committee, whether they want it or not. And such a committee debate has pros and cons.\n I'll just say the advantages are that you actually\n under the members of the coalition opposition\n not already the show business, as I always say,\n which then takes place in the plenary room,\n already has in the faculty committee.\n So I'll just say window talks, window debates,\n but sometimes it's really about the matter.\n That's the advantage if you don't talk publicly.\n If you talk publicly, it has the great advantage that the citizens can be there.\n They can participate, they see the debates.\n But it has the disadvantage...\n I can see what my members are working on.\n But it has the disadvantage that they are just talking and I have always said that's stupid.\n Then the exchange of ideas between coalition and opposition\n was already taken into consideration in the faculty committee.\n And I experienced that in non-public meetings\n we often found the opportunity to reach a consensus.\n Not always, because the roles between coalition and opposition\n are already clearly regulated.\n But still, you often had similarities in the matter.\n And that's taken away from you a little bit when you talk publicly.\n But now I've been in some non-public sessions and even there there are these talks about opposition.\n Yes, that's part of it. Both have their roles.\n So that the opposition sees the coalition's drafts critically is logical.\n I've been in the opposition. Right. And there are also other countries, where it even has to be the case that these committees\n are held publicly and then it will be transferred.\n Yes. So I think we now have increasingly technical difficulties that we do not transfer everything live.\n We sometimes draw up and put ...\n Do you have no fiberglass or what?\n That's the topic of digitization in the German Ministry of Justice.\n But we will now modernize the meeting technology that we have in the summer break.\n So it will be like this over and over again.\n And I can also imagine that even in the next legislature, almost all committees will also be held publicly.\n So most of them have now also gathered positive experiences with it, I would say now.\n I met with the chairmen of the board and did a feedback round.\n How is it? Because many were only critical and now want to have almost all public days.\n Are you actually sitting in a board?\n No.\n Because you have so much to do as a boss?\n Exactly.\n Could you, so would that be possible, could you wish that or is it automatically like that? The mayoral office? No, no, the president.\n No, I think that has to do with the office, that you don't have a departmental office anymore.\n Because that's a difficult role anyway. On the one hand I am a member of parliament for my city, for my electorate and belong to the SPD.\n On the other hand I have an office where you expect neutrality and can and must also be expected. And that's always a bit of a spagat.\n But if I were in a department, I would have to position myself somehow.\n That will then be difficult with the neutral board, for example.\n Therefore I have, my committees are the presidium,\n where I discuss things with my vice president and vice president,\n and the oldest council.\n These are my two main committees, where I then also lead the session.\n Why is there actually an oldest council but not a youngest council?\n Yes, I don't know why the oldest council is there either.\n The oldest are not in this council.\n What? Not?\n No, it sounds like that.\n Who is sitting in there?\n So there are actually the parliamentary board members,\n so the first parliamentary board members of the faction are sitting there and the other parliamentary chairmen are sitting there for the household of the responsible householder, for the Bundestagshaus.\n And my vice president and vice president and me, that's the oldest council."

We would like to do that, but unfortunately we don't have a ladies' toilet.\n And maybe you're saying that you only applied to NRW? Maybe you had to look elsewhere?\n In the GDR, women were allowed to do that.\n Yes, I know. It was probably a thing from the West, I don't know.\n But I didn't apply to the federal government.

For me it's also a question of education.\n I can actually create children from households where there is not so much money for support.\n Children have sufficient funding.\n And with everyone else who has taken the same path or a similar path, I always hear the same story and that's true. There were always people, persons, individuals who saw something in you and supported you.\n Sometimes neighbours, friends or parents or teachers who saw you and said, do this.\n And with me it was like that in the hospital, the boss saw that in the office, somehow it is also underfunded.\n Do the training, then you can do the paperwork here in the health insurance.\n So that's how it started. There was always someone who said, I offer you a chance here, take it.\n And then of course you have to take the chance or not. And I belong to the category, if someone offers me a chance, I take it. A little bit was also the case with me.\n That you have the luck, I think that's another factor,\n that you have the luck to know someone who likes you.\n There are also bosses or executives who are like, I don't care.\n The luck also comes with it.\n Yes, and I think it's a pity that a lot depends on luck and personal contacts.\n Actually, our education system has to be such that you give the children from the state schools so much support that they don't have to wait for luck, but that they get the targeted support.\n How do you explain to yourself as a Social Democrat that we haven't been able to do this for decades? Because that's not a new realization."

We need storage that is long-term. As far as I know,\n hydrogen is so far the only idea how to save energy.\n But you need a lot of energy to produce hydrogen.\n You can leave it there and that is the source of energy.\n That's how the energy transition is planned.\n That's the concept that is being pursued at the moment.\n That was up to 2045, gas, was supposed to be the basic transition technology,\n replaced by hydrogen. But hydrogen is only a storage.\n And we need a lot of energy to produce this hydrogen.\n That's why I want to...\n We spend 1,000 billion from Europe to get this done as quickly as possible.\n Money can't be a question.\n Keynes himself said,\n Anything we can actually do, we can afford.\n Clemens, that's true.\n That would be so great, but unfortunately it's completely wrong.\n The problem is not...\n Everything we can actually do, we can afford.\n Is that wrong?\n The problem is the following.\n The number of engineers we have, the number of scientists we have who can do something like this is limited.\n Okay, are we in agreement? Our resources are simply limited and we have to think about where we can put them.\n We could do it like this and say, we put in a lot of resources, but it doesn't come down to money. That's just my point. It comes down to real resources.\n We need people who we can say, you are now working on research for the renewal of the energy system.\n And I think that it is indeed important that research is expanded in this area.\n But research has already been done. There are probably hundreds, thousands of scientists who can predict how we will achieve exactly this in the next 10 to 20 years.\n The technology is there.\n No, I don't think so. We still have to do a lot to research, to improve it. I think that's right. We are surrounded by countries that are convinced that this cannot be done without nuclear energy or without continuous hydrogen supply from abroad.\n Only Germany, Germany is the only country that believes that expanding such technologies. I think it's all good.\n But I can't really imagine how it will work. And I think the idea that you have infinite resources is not right.\n And that has to do with the fact that it's not about money. So you can print money infinitely.\n But what we have from researchers, from people, from engineers\n who can develop something like that, that is already limited. So if you now\n run a lot of resources in this area, it simply means that you have less for other areas.\n Clemens, that was it from me. I only have a few questions from the audience.\n Very good.\n Are you ready?\n Yes.\n Maren asks, which party are you close to? As a citizen of the state, I have a political and political connection, but as a scientist, I'm not interested in parties.\n Are you a member of a party?\n No.\n You are part of the CDU's economic council.",
      "We believe that it is not sustainable.\n I personally believe that the discussion is totally hardened.\n We are not even talking about new technologies.\n We are not talking about hydrogen stories.\n This whole discussion is always about wind power or coal, electric cars or diesel.\n I believe that we as Germans are no longer so innovative.\n In innovative, I wanted to say.\n Because we don't even think about what third or fourth possibilities there are.\n I think that other countries are doing better than we are. And this discussion is also being carried out with a lot of foam in the mouth.\n What about the solar panels? How much do you want to expand?\n So solar is an option, especially if you say you don't do it large-scale, but people can do that for themselves. It's absurd when you say they have an overproduction and have to pay money to feed it.\n Then it gets weird.\n We can't do it in a large scale.\n Other countries can do it. Israel for example.\n If you have large desert areas where no one lives.\n Germany is a very densely populated country.\n I think there will be few possibilities for a large-scale solar solution.\n Do you have a plan?\n Do you have a plan?\n Solar energy does not play a role in Brandenburg at the moment.\n But could it?\n That would be future-proof or not?\n But not in the large area.\n You don't have any unoccupied areas here where you say ...\n You can say that a solar cell comes to every roof of a Brandenburger.\n You mean by prescribing it legally?\n For example.\n I wouldn't do that.\n You could do it differently and say, if you do it on your own house, you pay the tax.\n Those are possibilities. I think that solar, also from the sunny days, if we look at the numbers in the evaluation and results, that is also not a bearable solution.\n I think we should look at what happens with hydrogen, what What about dual fluid reactors?\n I think that's interesting.\n People have to judge that in research, who can do that.\n But Germany is no longer a research country.\n We have 200 gender-gag professors in Germany, but not a single school for reactor research.\n Not to put nuclear power plants there, but simply to research.\n I think Germany has long been dependent on what other countries somehow give so should also make a head over it.\n Is Germany not sovereign? Why not?\n Of course Germany is a sovereign state. Without restrictions.\n I don't understand the question. We all have the restrictions through contracts,\n all European countries have them. And if you actually discuss sovereignty,\n then you actually have to ask the, and you could even say that sovereignty is increasingly restricted by EU regulations.\n That you look at how many parts of legislation that we have to implement actually take place in the EU parliament is democratically elected, but the majority of decisions come from the commission.\n And the commissioners are not democratically elected.\n And in fact it is so...\n They are democratically elected by the parliament. Or rather confirmed.\n Confirmed, not elected.\n But they can't confirm.\n Yes, but we know how it works in practice. And I think we already know that.\n Because there are always wealthy people who are put in politics.\n And I think you can say that parts of national sovereignty for all states in Europe are restricted by EU legislation.\n Would you leave the EU if you were in power in Germany?\n I think it's about reforming the EU.\n And that's what it says. The AfD is often\n connected with\n Dexit. They want to get out of the EU.\n That's not true. If we wanted that,\n we wouldn't have made a long\n demand catalogue.\n But that's one Euro.\n Not for every price. It's about\n saying, we made a long\n demand catalogue, what we want to\n reform in the EU. And if all of that doesn't work, you have to keep this option open to say, okay, people, it's not possible.\n Then we just go out.\n There was already a life without the EU in the previous form.\n So there was already a super economic cooperation.\n EWG was called EG at the time.\n European Economic Community, European Community.\n It worked well.\n It's definitely not about clearing the borders in Europe and falling back into the state of 100 years ago.\n That's not what it's about."

    "response": "\nThe research focus of the ifo-Institut, as explained by its President Clemens Fuest, is on conducting excellent research and being well-evaluated. The institute aims to maintain its independence and transparency in terms of financing sources. Its main funding comes from membership in the Leibniz Community, which provides approximately 60% to 70% of their budget, with the remaining funds coming from various third parties such as the European Commission, federal and state governments, foundations, and research organizations. The institute also accepts commissions from associations and conducts surveys for clients.\n\nFuest defines the concept of 'science' in the context of the institute's work as a process involving the development of falsifiable hypotheses based on data collection and analysis.

      "And the IFO has its roots in the Bavarian State Office for Statistics.\n We no longer had the big center, Berlin, and so institutes have developed in different regions.\n And the IFO has developed in Munich.\n How do you finance yourselves? Where does the money come from? We are members of the Leibniz Community and that means that from our basic equipment,\n that is about 60% to 70% of our funds, depending on how you count,\n comes every half of the country and federal government, so the Free State of Bavaria and federal government.\n We get the money and are evaluated every seven years by the Leibniz community.\n There is a commission of independent scientists who look at what the IFO Institute does,\n how the scientific performance is, how it works with the funding of young scientists?\n What about gender balance? All these things that we expect.\n And then the commission says to continue or not to continue funding.\n And that has a huge advantage, namely it gives us independence.\n So, for example, if the federal government says,\n what FUSS has already said, that doesn't suit us, we don't want to finance it anymore,\n then you would say, very nice, in five years the next evaluation is made.\n Then you can speak in front of this independent group of scientists and then you can explain to them why they believe that the IFO should not be further financed. That is something different than if the Minister of Finance could take over\n and say, hello IFO, take care of it, otherwise you will not be financed.\n I think most of the ministers of finance would not do that.\n But that they can't do it is nice.\n Otherwise I wouldn't do this job either.\n Is it 100% from tax?\n No, that is our basic financing. Then there are third parties. So we take research orders from the European Commission, from the\n federal ministries, from state ministries, from foundations, from the DFG, i.e. from\n research and funding organizations. And our strategy is that we want to finance ourselves as broadly as possible so that we are independent of anyone.\n And sometimes such funds are also quality certificates. For example, if you have funds from the German Research Community, you don't get them easily if you're not really good at science.\n So you should have funds from the German Research Community. But we also do surveys for associations, for all kinds of associations.\n All kinds of associations?\n So we have to find out that this is a reasonable question.\n Give me an example where you say, for this association we are not doing anything.\n Yes, I don't know whether you would exclude certain associations or certain branches.\n There are certain branches that are in a slant. For example the cigarette industry, many say no to what we have nothing to do with.\n I can't remember that the cigarette industry would have approached us. I wouldn't exclude it right away, but of course you would ask about it. Or in the image coal industry or something.\n Yes, or coal industry, for example, I wouldn't have a problem making a report for them now.\n However, important, we also tell all the people who come to us, our research is always\n result-based. So we don't make reports that are already clear beforehand what should come out.\n And we publish everything. You can't come to us and say, okay, make a report, but that may then disappear\n in a drawer. This is also an agreement in the Leibniz community,\n under the Leibniz Institutes. There are other research institutes\n and we say, no, we won't do that. We are not profit-oriented,\n but we want to do research.\n So I just mentioned our goals. We want to do excellent research, we want to be well evaluated.\n That's what our further financing is all about. And we don't depend on individual\n donors. Another point, we are actually transparent in terms of our\n donors. That means we always make it open to anyone who has financed a report.\n And then the public can see, okay.\n Would you like to be profit-oriented?\n No, that's not really the point for us.\n It simply has to do with the fact that science doesn't carry itself.\n Or at least not without further ado.\n It has a public good character.\n It is financed by the state.\n If we were a profit-oriented company, then our work would be different.",

That is also our claim, that it is among these five goals that I have mentioned,\n also the most important, because that is the basis of everything.\n So we can only do political consultations if it is based on an excellent scientific basis.\n And now you can ask, what is science?\n But science is not a natural science.\n Yes, okay, you can ask, is it like a natural science?\n There is a debate about it, so is economy science?\n And there is a nice article by Raj Chetty,\n one of the world's leading financial scientists,\n who explains why he thinks that\n economics is a science. And science produces falsifiable hypotheses,\n so you can define it anyway. I'm not a philosopher of science. You can say,\n okay, a science produces falsifiable hypotheses and then tests them on data. She says that if the oil price rises, if the gasoline price rises, then the emissions of the car drivers for gasoline will drop.\n This thesis could be set up and then you could measure it.\n Then it could turn out that this is wrong, because the price increase is so strong that although the amount drops, the emissions rise.\n Or another thesis would be that the amount is decreasing. Or one thesis would be that if we lower the gas tax,\n then the price will decrease by less than the gas tax reduction.\n That would be a thesis.\n And there are studies that say, right, 30% flow into the pockets of the mineral oil companies.\n And because you test such things, because they are hypotheses that can be falsified, I would say that this is a science.\n There are also scientists, but scientists don't do that. There are other definitions of science. So, it's actually a science of the mind, we know it's sociology, it observes the society, the market, the economic situation and explains afterwards what happened.\n Well, slowly. So, sociology is also an empirical science in some ways. You also work with data, for example with survey data and things like that.\n for example with interrogation data and things like that. And you are right, it is in a certain\u2026\n We are being reduced by the way.\n Oh, right, sorry. You are right, the whole thing is in a certain scope forensic.\n So you look in retrospect at what actually happened,\n but you can also make predictions with the goal.\n Of course it becomes difficult.\n So the question is, what predictions can be made.\n Sociology is also a social science.\n In this respect, economic science is also very related.\n I know many colleagues in sociology who do empirical research and who are also in demand that they discover connections\n that they say will probably apply in the future.\n So if you see, for example, a work on the border between the two is,\n for example, colleagues at the IFO who do something like this,\n they have investigated what actually happens in families in economic crises.\n And then you notice that domestic violence is changing in economic crises,\n for example, increases case of unemployment.\n No surprise.\n And that has been observed in the past.\n And I fear that it will be the same in future economic crises.\n So you can say, okay, that also produces predictions.\n And in that sense it is a science that can produce predictions."

    "response": "\nThe argument for using a CO2 price instead of regulations to reduce CO2 emissions in industries, according to Clemens Fuest, President of the ifo-Institut, lies in ensuring a competitive marketplace. He believes that a certificate trading system, which sets a price for CO2 emissions, encourages companies to find the most cost-effective ways to reduce their emissions. This approach leads to savings where it is easiest and more affordable, ultimately resulting in a higher level of competitiveness. In contrast, regulations can lead to increased costs and potentially discourage innovation, while also pushing CO2 reduction efforts into areas where it might not be as efficient.",
    "contexts": [
      "Because the question would be, if such a law were to come, how would you adjust to it? It could be that from the beginning no one does anything, because everyone assumes that the government won't stop it and then raises it again. But that's not how it happens. I have 20 years of experience that my company does not emit CO2 emissions,\n then I try to get from year to year to zero in the next 20 years.\n So more and more and less. That would be responsible. That would be good for business, right?\n Yes, some may behave like that, but I don't think that's the smartest way.\n The problem is that you are not coordinated.\n There are certain areas of our economy where it is relatively easy to reduce CO2 and there should be something\n done first. There are other areas where it is difficult to replace these things, there should be\n more time. And that's what the individual knows. But that's not in 20 years. You don't know,\n you don't know whether your GMBH here costs are higher than in other areas. And we want to\n get it done in a way that CO2 is first saved there, where the costs are higher here than in other areas and we want to get it economically so that CO2 is first saved where the costs are the lowest.\n And we can only do that if there is a price. Therefore, the CO2 price is so important.\n We are lucky in Europe that we have a CO2 emission certificate trading system\n and in principle limit quantities.\n Unfortunately, there are two important sectors, traffic and buildings, not yet included.\n But the goal should actually be to get these two sectors in.\n And then you would say, if you want to emit CO2 this year,\n then you pay 100 euros per unit, per ton of CO2 or whatever.\n And that's the market price for these certificates. And all companies,\n if you find that it only costs 80 euros to reduce CO2 in your company, then you reduce it.\n And then those who say, no, that costs me 150 euros to reduce it, they buy the certificates.\n And then the market ensures that CO2 is saved there, where it is the cheapest. And over time more and more certificates are taken from the market.\n That means the price of certificates is rising and CO2 is reduced in more and more places and in the end you are at zero.\n So you have to have a mechanism that works immediately.\n And just making regulations is not a good idea?\n I mean, we could also take another example,\n a fire extinguisher.\n That's a fire extinguisher ban.\n Exactly.\n That's also against it.\n That's not good, because\n if we have a certificate trade like that,\n then the price just rises.\n Why should I prescribe someone\n if they want a fire extinguisher or not?\n It's also superfluous. But you always say that these prices are a kind of motivation from the outside.\n You disturb people, it causes negative emotions, attitudes.\n What causes negative emotions? An increased price doesn't mean that you like cars anyway, but it starts with the fact that you think the fireman sucks\n and then shouts at the politicians and so on.\n But you don't yell at people when they're banned, right?\n That's a motivation for something.\n I get there...\n You can say that if someone gets a earful, it's a motivation for something.\n That's what convinces me. A ban is not a motivation for something.\n I would see it differently. A price annoys me less than a ban.\n At a price I can say, okay, it will be expensive for me, but if I really need it, I can still do it.\n If I don't have a charging station nearby, I can buy another\n burner. It's expensive for me, but there's still an option.\n You shouldn't buy a burner anymore.\n No, why not? If it's worth so much to me, if it's much cheaper\n for someone who finds it easier to save CO2, then it's much better.\n I buy the burner overall. I have to pay the price and\n the certificates ensure that we achieve the goal.\n The question is how do we achieve the goal?\n The certificates ensure that CO2 is used where it is the least valuable to people.\n That means that combustion engines will also disappear there, where it is not so important to people, where they say I can also switch to electric cars easily.",
      "No, they weaken it, because they make climate protection more expensive than it really has to be. It gets more expensive.\n You want to do it more expensive with the CO2 tax. I want to ensure competition and innovation by the companies to think of something.\n Forget about innovation. Just now about the mechanism.\n We have to bring down the CO2 price, the CO2 emissions.\n And the certificate trading ensures that this happens where the costs are the lowest.\n And as a result, it is the way that guarantees the highest competitiveness.\n If we intervene with bans, then this means that we avoid CO2 where it is very expensive.\n We just go in with bans.\n I understand.\n Can't we do both?\n CO2 price, just as you want it, and still the prescription from 2045 is over with CO2 emissions.\n How do you get there?\n No, I think you have to make sure that the population accepts it at all.\n There are not all the big fans of it.\n The best chances that this will be accepted are when the costs are the lowest.\n If we don't push them unnecessarily up. And that's what the certificate trade achieves, that we save where it is most affordable.\n What would it mean if Germany were the first industrial country in the world to be climate neutral?\n For our competitiveness. Would that benefit us more?\n So first of all, it is a burden. If you decide not to use a resource, it is a burden.\n We are the first climate-neutral country in the world and that is a burden.\n Yes, but that doesn't help. You mean competition. So the question is, what is competitiveness? How should you do that? I'm trying to stay in your thoughts. Wouldn't that be the most blatant advantage of all time in terms of competition if we learned that in the first place?\n First of all, if I decide to use a resource that I can use, that others can use, not to use anymore.\n Let's imagine that we would say nobody works anymore.\n The resource is energy, we just replace it with clean energy. Yes, exactly, but we don't use the fossil energy anymore. We're giving it up.\n It's as if we would say, we won't use the two hours between 4 and 6 pm anymore.\n We don't like it, we shouldn't work on it. We're giving up on this resource.\n And all the others can use the two it. We are setting a limit.\n If everyone would set it up, then the environment would benefit.\n And then it would be nice. But we set this limit, others don't.\n Then we don't have anything of it at first.\n You always praise innovation.\n If we are the most innovative country in the world in the ecological sense,\n then isn't that good?\n Yes, that's something completely different.\n You can be an innovative country without being climate neutral.\n But the goal is climate neutrality.\n We have now given ourselves climate neutrality.\n Let's assume, I think maybe you can put it that way, if we knew that all other countries\n do that, then our companies would already understand that. By the way,\n like all other countries will understand that, okay, the Germans start in 2045,\n we a little later. They know exactly, okay, there is a German market and the world\n is oriented towards climate neutrality, then all companies will anticipate this and will direct appropriate research and development.\n Our companies will also direct themselves to this. It is often said that we have to become climate neutral because electric cars will soon and know that in China only electric cars are being asked on this market, then they build electric cars completely independent of what happens to us.\n But they don't have to be convinced if they know that this is the law.\n Yes, again.\n But why convince someone if you can make the that our market is not the decisive factor.\n It is decisive what happens in China.\n We already had a few CEOs in the show and they also said that innovation is created through regulations, through bans.\n That was the case in the 70s in Germany. There were the first environmental regulations and so on.\n Suddenly the German chemical industry became the most leading one.\n Because they had to do innovations.\n No, I think the German chemical industry is a little more leading.\n But...\n Monika Schnitzer said a few weeks ago, she also said, innovations are created by prohibitions.\n Yes, but they are not the German prohibitions."

Their backgrounds and ideologies contributed to the AfD's xenophobic and racist discourse through their emphasis on building structures from the West in the East, focusing on areas perceived as deprived, and appealing to right-wing populism in both Europe and beyond. These figures may have drawn upon their experiences and perspectives from their upbringings in West Germany, where they might have encountered different societal issues compared to those in the East.

And it is also important that this debate is once conducted.\n But I think we explain too little system theoretically, namely what is actually behind it, behind the\n construction of right-wing networks throughout Europe and not only in Europe, it goes,\n no idea, to Brazil, USA etc. and that probably also fulfills a function\n that everything is now being deposited in the east and somehow it generally plays a too small role in the debates about the AfD.\n I would like to ask a follow-up question.\n Because I think you also pointed out, Anette, that you say that right-wing radicalism and xenophobia had already existed in the GDR,\n and that was precisely because they were not discussed, they were taboo topics.\n That is precisely why they lived under one surface, developed and then find now,\n you are right, what is now being implemented structurally by the West,\n finds a ground that has developed since the founding of the GDR.\n Personal experience, I was the first journalist in the GDR in 1983.\n We were in Dresden in the evening in a pub,\n you were immediately recognized as Westerners.\n And the very first thing that someone from the Young Dresdner said to us after five minutes was,\n do you actually know that there is an insanely strong neo-Nazi scene here in Dresden?\n And do you know that one of the main characters of this neo-Nazi scene is the son of a high-ranking SED-functionary of Robotron.\n So really, at that time, the GDR elite.\n Apparently everyone in Dresden knew, at least in the youth scene,\n they told us that after five minutes, but it was not an official topic at all.\n If this experience, which is now my personal one, is correct structurally, Annette, and is it so that the suppressed but existing right-wing radicalism that existed in GDR conditions is now being shared in election results for the AfD? Yes, you actually already said that.\n I can only underline that.\n And it was so that, so to speak,\n against this kind of\n over-actuated anti-fascism,\n where you had the feeling\n that you had to be anti-fascist\n and were always forced to do so.\n That's why you have to go to the army in the GDR.\n That's why you have to work hard and that's why you have to always be loyal to the GDR.\n And also the wall, the anti-fascist protection vote,\n of course, also has such a counter-movement,\n a psychological counter-movement,\n that, for example, in my school, people\n just ripped crosses into the bank as an aversion against this\n incriminating, which did not always go hand in hand with Nazi ideology.\n But then later on.\n And there were very explicit Nazi groups.\n And it was often the children of the\n officials, because it was the most possible resistance for them. And the problem was, of course, that it was never processed.\n Thank you for letting me take a seat here, Hans H\u00fctt.\n Five years ago, I was also on Thilo's side as an elder statesman at Thilo's side for five years.\n I'd like to talk about a historically comparable perspective that reminds the West of a similar role,\n as it seems to be playing today in the East.\n On 10 November 1989 I flew from Frankfurt am Main to West Berlin.",
      "He immediately marched into the East and I still have the pictures in front of my eyes.\n There was a dumb crowd of people sitting at the table.\n And he predicted, they were beaten to part, but they were also exactly with\n the sentiments that Annette describes, Nazis in the East, by the way, the good\n Frey, Norbert Frey, wrote a brilliant book again, where he even wonderfully describes how\n the comrades and comrades-in-arms in the 90s wrote entries to Honecker, there was the practice,\n nobody in the SED looked at what was happening on the streets and what was happening to the right-wing people.\n So there was this scene, she sat down, 89, 90 in the basement and Bella Hanshans speaks to them and says to them, you are called the new generation and the new class of rulers.\n It was already moving at that time, even from the various defeat and defense experiences, but it doesn't explain or say anything about\n that you could achieve a greater number with this leader tradition,\n even if they are wessies, than they were in the West.\n That's why I prognosticate that the strategy of the AfD to take a foot in the West,\n exactly with the clever chess move of Gauland Begin,\n and that is above all the devastating one,\n which is now still underfed by the CDU Thuringia, so at least by Moring and\n above all his representative in the parliamentary session, he says yes, that is actually a\n civil party. This interplay of the civilisation will be practiced in the west\n because the typus H\u00f6cke, so my thesis as a leader typus, then a little more\n is in contradiction than he is obviously in the west, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg,\n because there were other topics why the AfD, very different topics in part,\n than he was in Thuringia and other eastern states was able to connect.\n And I think that is worth investigating, because otherwise you will not be the\n danger of the AfD. Therefore, I think you have to look very specifically\n what, with which strategy you are trying to place.\n Cut. We have the first young man here on stage. That's great. Who are you?\n So thank you for the compliment that I am young. So Michael is my name, born in Rostock in 1979,\n that is in the GDR. I moved to Berlin in 1988, not myself, but my parents drove me there.\n And then I'm turning. I've lived and worked in Stuttgart for a long time, in Zurich.\n I know the Wessis, who drove here in the east, and the Ossis, who drove here in the west.\n The whole migrants, I was also one in Zurich, there are many people who come from all over the world and work,\n like here in Berlin by now.\n So I know the world quite well, even if I haven't seen all of them,\n but the people who come from the world.\n I have three points that I would like to address if I have the time.\n The first point, we are talking about 30 years of reunification,\n and we are only talking about the AfD, Nazis, right wingers. I mean, if the leftists in Thuringia are now\n diligently talking about CDU, SPD, FDP, Greens, maybe even left wingers.\n Well, that's what they used to say, that the East Party is now dissolved.\n The left doesn't like it that way, that the AfD is now the East Party.\n But if they all voted normally now, then we wouldn't have a problem and we wouldn't have to discuss anything.\n Then there would be no issue of reunification that we could talk about.\n I think that's a bit one-sided, I have to say.\n And that leads to the second point.\n That leads to the second point.\n Reunification was of course a difficult topic.\n We know that.\n It wasn't quite clear that the reunification would come.\n There were many problems. It could have been that it didn't work.\n And back then, you just talked to yourself in West Germany.\n The Aussies talked to each other.\n And you talked to the Aussies.\n Yes, it will simply be the Federal Republic.\n That's all great. Everything stays the way it is. Wonderful.\n But actually, every person who thinks about it knows,\n that he could have, should have, should have created a new country.\n But that didn't happen."

      "And I think in that case it just made one person very\n easy and said,\n I just invent this story.\n We already know that from other areas.\n The Spiegel has also gained good experience with it.\n Now you've been dealing with Afghanistan for a year. Why?\n Well, it was like this.\n I think we all have these pictures in our memories.\n 2021, the power overrun by the Taliban.\n And I followed these pictures back then and I think they took me very well.\n So for various reasons, of course, I think for the reasons that many others also share,\n namely simply to see the humanitarian aspect,\n and to ask ourselves what exactly went wrong.\n Then I also have a personal connection to Afghanistan.\n My father comes from Afghanistan, I was born in Afghanistan myself.\n Masar-i-Sharif, the city of Kenya, also known for the Germans.\n And yes, so that was then ultimately, these two aspects led to the fact that I asked myself when I saw these pictures, okay, what exactly is actually happening there in Afghanistan?\n What exactly is my family doing now?\n So I still have a few family members who live in Afghanistan, my grandfather, for example.\n Most of them are from Afghanistan, but have fled.\n for example. But most of them fled from Afghanistan. And yes, when I saw that, I wondered how much I actually know about Afghanistan at all. And I just want to\n deal more intensively with this topic. Did you deal with Afghanistan before the withdrawal of the West?\n Very superficially. So of course I knew the history of Afghanistan. I grew up with this\n story myself and was politicized by my family alone.\n I read books about it out of my own interest, but I wasn't a journalist in this area, so I wouldn't consider myself an Afghan expert.\n I think you have to deal with this country for a very, very long time. When we started dealing with this topic in the editorial office, it was at this point when none of the ARD was in Afghanistan.\n So I think we may have noticed this debate in part that no one was there when the Taliban\n took over power and it was at that point, yes, a bit, it was a bit hopeless for us to fly to Afghanistan. So we didn't really expect to fly to Afghanistan and it was a bit hopeless for us to fly to Afghanistan.\n We didn't expect to fly to Afghanistan.\n It was a bit of a problem with how to make a film about Afghanistan from Germany.\n But in the end, everything developed so that we said, we have to go to Afghanistan.\n The whole planning took a few months. Let's start at the beginning.\n Were you in the 20 years when we had the say in Afghanistan?\n No. I was born in Afghanistan.\n My family fled Afghanistan in the 90s.\n Born when the Taliban were in power? No, I was born when Afghanistan was in the eighth year of the Soviet-Afghan war.\n And my family fled from Afghanistan after the withdrawal of the Soviets.\n To Germany?\n Yes, exactly, to Germany.\n And then it was like that how was it exactly, we came to Germany and I have to say that I had great respect for going back to Afghanistan.\n Why?\n I think I was very much influenced by the reports and Afghanistan, where it was always just about war and terror.\n And I think if you are fleeing from a country where the situation has not really improved in the last few years, where there is still war, it is a bit of a wish to return. I had respect for it. I had certain images of Afghanistan.\n I had the story of my family, who also fell out of time.\n And I always knew I had to come back at some point.\n I just have to know what Afghanistan is like.\n But I pushed it a little bit.\n And then some things came together and then I had to go back.\n What did the family say? And then some things came together and I had to go back.\n What did the family say?\n Yes, so...\n Drive safely, say hello to grandpa or...\n Good luck.\n No, they said, don't drive.\n We don't know how the situation is on site at all. And I think there is also a very, very big discrepancy in terms in how we perceive Afghanistan in Germany and how Afghanistan is on site.\n I had also spoken to my grandpa and my grandpa had told me, yes, it is safe at the moment, the war is over.",
      "That's the reality.\n That's the regime that was brought into power by the West.\n And with this regime you have to work together.\n What mechanisms are behind it, how to ensure that they adhere to human rights,\n I don't know, because that's totally un-transparent to this day.\n That means, if I were to go to point 2, I would wish that much more transparently documented would be how all these negotiations are going on, how these wars are being waged. and investigative journalists, but that politicians also feel obliged to be more transparent.\n We don't know anything about the progress with the conversations.\n We don't know what exactly was discussed with the Taliban in the last one and a half years.\n We just know that it definitely didn't help, because the schools are still closed.\n And the third point.\n And the third point. I would like the world not to stop talking about Afghanistan, that it will not become one of these countries that is simply forgotten,\n which has happened again and again in the history of Afghanistan, but we have a responsibility in Afghanistan,\n because the West has been in this country for 20 years and there is simply a\n great responsibility for this country. That is why it is very important, and everyone can do that\n individually, to keep this debate about Afghanistan alive. There was the question, a person said,\n I would like to help in Afghanistan, I would like to send money there. Are there any NGOs that are active there that you can trust,\n where you can be sure that the money will arrive where people are actually helped?\n Yes, definitely. There are many NGOs, smaller and larger NGOs.\n I always find it better to support the smaller NGOs.\n If you go to our film, the film we have published, I think it's better to support the smaller NGOs.\n If you go to our movie, the movie we published, you'll find some trustworthy NGOs listed in the description.\n I don't know all of them, but there are five or six big and small ones\n who have a very good reputation.\n Okay.\n The movie can be found in the media library.\n And on YouTube.\n And on YouTube.\n The long film is on YouTube and also in the AD-media library, but I think YouTube is easier\n to find for most people.\n Can you speak to the Taliban about a fascist or fascist structure or form of organization?\n And how close are you to the ideology of Daesh, the IS?\n The Taliban are definitely a fundamentalist movement and a militant Islamic movement.\n They have that together with the ISK. There are some, I would say, ideological differences between the Taliban and the ISK.\n So the Taliban, the, I would say, the religious explanation of Islam of the Taliban is the Deobandism.\n I don't think many people know that, it's not very well known. I don't either.\n Yes, so this Deoband movement is also going back to very, very\u2026\n So this movement was simply created as a reaction to the British occupation of India.\n And it goes back to this very, very old school and this one, which is a Salafist movement during the ISK,\n rather Salafist, but they are actually only nuances that differentiate these movements from each other.\n They are also, I'll say, it sounds very similar to us, their religious\n interpretation. They are mainly different in their transnational identity, in the sense that they want to expand Islam.\n Then they are asked, is the view of Germany and the USA different in terms of citizens in cities country, with women, men, different?\n Or is there a generalizable attitude?\n So what was the question, especially after the kind of this refugee withdrawal?\n Yes, so I think everyone agrees that Afghanistan was left in the dark,\n that one is completely equal and ignorant of this country.\n But of course there are big differences in how you end up finding it.\n And I think finding black and white answers in Afghanistan is difficult anyway.\n Afghanistan is really the land of the greyhounds.\n And as I said earlier, the realities of life are very different.\n If you meet people on the land who have been terrorized for 20 years by drone attacks and air attacks,\n they are of course happy that the West has withdrawn. But if you meet a journalist in Kabul who has lost her job and cannot protest anymore\n and is completely restricted in her freedom of movement,\n she is of course incredibly distressed that the structures of the West have come together with the West.\n That's why the realities of life are very different in Afghanistan."

      "Ready?\n So, a new episode of Jung & Naiv. We have an old acquaintance. You were there more often.\n Where are you, Jung & Naiv?\n I am the Federal Minister of Finance, I think.\n Besides the Federal Council's deputy, a member of the CDU.\n And someone who is interested in discussing politics.\n That's why I'm here in the studio.\n You're a member of the party. You were in the CDU-Fraktion meeting on Tuesday.\n Did you ask a question or position yourself?\n No, I've known the two of them for many years.\n I was elected to the Bundestag with Armin Laschet in 1994.\n I met Markus S\u00f6der when I was the Minister of the Environment.\n He was also Minister of the Environment, in Bavaria,\n very successful by the way.\n I know the two,\n I have thought about this question for a long time.\n And therefore I thought it was good\n that we had a parliamentary session\n where many colleagues\n who are not in the government,\n who have not been with us for 30 years, were able to say their opinions. We are all\n interested in the fact that the decision we then make will be carried out by everyone.\n Did you position yourself?\n Yes, I already have a concrete idea, of course. The most important thing for me, however, is that we return to the conclusion after the decision.\n That's why I, as in the question, did not give public recommendations to Armin Laschet, Friedrich Merz, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen,\n not so far anyway, but I formed my own opinion back then and then voted as a party delegate.\n And so it will be here too. Of course, one or the other also reports to ask for assessment.\n But I don't think that's part of your channel now.\n And I think we have the obligation as CDU and CSU to quickly decide this question.\n The Greens probably need a little longer.\n You mean that you will do this until Monday before the Greens?\n I hope so.\n But you are also part of Team Laschet, right?\n So it would be new to me if you were a S\u00f6der supporter.\n I don't think I said for whom I am public.\n And I don't do now in this show of course\n I have, however, very much for that\n said that we are that we are also a bit after\n direct what our not only the minister presidents also the\n Federal Parliament colleagues the mayor the councilors the members of the cdu\n our voters in this question think and want to address this issue.\n We had a lot of time to listen in this week.\n I think each of us has received a few hundred e-mails, letters, calls.\n It is a topic that interests us, yes.\n And what is the problem? That everyone says publicly they want publicly, very simply. We don't want Armin Laschet or Markus S\u00f6der to be hurt in the end.\n But they are both presidents of our parties and we believe that it is important that we go to this election in a closed way.\n But that means that one has to become one through ARUS and I hope that we can talk about this at the weekend.\n Are you a member of the CDU-presidium or the board?\n No, I was invited to the presidium for about 10 years as Chancellor and as the first PGF.\n I was a member of the federal board for a long time.\n I made room for someone else from thearland at the last election, but as Prime Minister I will be invited to the meetings and have the opportunity to express myself if I want to.\n And it was clear on Monday that you were for Las that everyone makes it clear to the two parties that they are behind their own president.\n But the problem is not solved yet, we have to decide together.\n And that is now the next step. And again, I don't think that the reason is that we are doing one bad and the other good,\n but we want to make an honest, clear, but of course also a successful offer to the voters.\n And not only personally, but also in terms of content. Very important.\n By the way, the SPD had already solved its Chancellor candidate question last summer.\n I did not have the impression that this was so useful, when I look at the survey figures since then.\n The Greens and CDU and CSU will decide that in a few days.",
      "The Green Party has also made a campaign against the establishment in its own party.\n Since you are the Greens, do you already support the political establishment in Germany?\n I think you have to be clear about that. After 35 years or more than that we are established.\n But I would still say in the best sense.\n So, a new episode of Jung Naiv. We are in Berlin.\n But why are we sitting here opposite the Ministry of Finance?\n Are you doing a watch blog?\n Yes, business and traffic. I'm sitting here at the level of the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Transport.\n He's right across the street, sometimes we wave at each other. I've known him since I was a Minister of Transport.\n Who are you?\n But it's so in the middle of Berlin.\n Who are you? But it's so in the middle of Berlin.\n Who are you?\n Who I am?\n Simone Peter,\n Federal Chairman of B\u00fcndnis 90 Die Gr\u00fcnen\n for about three, three and a half years.\n And before that, I studied biology\n very early on,\n worked a lot on the subject of renewable energies,\n Eurosolar, the European Association for Renewable Energy, accompanied me, set up an agency for renewable energy here in Berlin.\n Then I became minister of the Saarland almost overnight. That was two years, then deputy minister of the country and then chairman of the federal government. So a very busy biography.\n Are you at the peak of your career. Does anyone know? Or woman? No idea.\n I always wait for a bit to see what comes.\n I'm excited. The life is still long, I hope.\n If you say you studied biology, did you want to be something completely different after school than what you are now?\n Actually not at all. I definitely wanted to design something. I wanted to do something in the field of the environment.\n I grew up in the 80s when the topic of forest death, dirty rivers, over-dyeing of the soils was already a topic.\n And that was when I studied biology. And I grew up in a political family.\n My mother was already a minister in Saarland, in the cabinet of Oskar Lafontaine, back in the SPD times.\n The topic of politics was always on the agenda. We were together on the fence of the nuclear power plant Kattenum, we were together at the demos against NATO double decisions. That has politicized. I think whether you want to do politics or not, that's not certain.\n That's not predetermined, but it may not have come from nowhere that I became that.\n You studied first and didn't do politics. So you studied in the end. Did you ever have a normal job?\n Yes, several. After my studies I still promoted.\n You are Dr. Peter. I am Dr. You are a doctor, Peter.\n I am a doctor, Peter, exactly.\n In biology.\n In biology, in microbiology.\n I took care of the industrial wastewater in Saar and Moose.\n As a woman that was a pretty lonely job.\n A lot of engineers, a lot of men.\n But a very exciting job because it was about how to avoid the water from tipping over.\n How can the fish and plants survive?\n It was exciting. I didn't really want to, but the project did.\n Did you bring in anything new? How to protect them?\n Yes, actually quite simply by reducing the wastewater that flows into the rivers.\n And that doesn't regulate the traffic jam that much.\n Saar and Mosel are actually like\n connected lakes because there are so many traffic jams in them and if there are still\n waste coming in, then the whole thing gives a dangerous mixture, the oxygen is\n torn up, the animals no longer have oxygen to breathe and that's why you have to\n raise the flow rate and the organic inputs, i.e. reduce the waste.\n And that was very exciting, has also produced good results.\n And now it is running in the Saarland from a biological point of view?\n It is still a country with a high industrial share.\n That was also a later task as a minister.\n So it was fun to be able to answer politics,\n that we protect water and air.\n Many, many clearing systems have now been created. And there were also industrial processes that took place.\n The active mining has been set up."

Is there a censoring agency for foreign media?\n Yes, for books, for movies. There are people who sit there and read through it, watch the movies and then decide what goes in there or not.\n Have you ever censored yourself?\n No.\n I'd rather not keep that for myself, so that I don't get annoyed.\n No, because you can actually formulate everything in a way that the point of criticism still comes,\n without immediately giving one out of twelve.\n Have you ever gotten one to twelve?\n I have.\n Have you ever had a problem?\n Yes, of course.

They told me that\n Is it similar in China?\n I don't think I know about that.\n Ski jokes.\n Ski jokes are definitely.\n So forbidden doesn't mean that you wouldn't tell them in a restaurant.\n You would do that. But forbidden means that you can't start an article with it.\n Do you know a good chivitz?\n Wait, I can't think of one. No.\n Do you only earn your money with journalism in Beijing? Or do you do something else?\n No, actually, if presentations are journalism, and that's it, then in the broadest sense no.\n You could say, like, consulting, or business stuff or something like that.\n No, I don't do anything with light bulbs or things like that. Although my friends have always advised me to do that.\n Once 300,000 lamps for Aldi, that's good.\n Because somehow I'm not that.\n I'm not interested.\n You could consult the German economy, how to proceed there.\n Yes, I could.\n But that's often so specific that I have no idea how I optimize a car production.\n I don't know.\n I can of course tell them how China is doing.\n I can do that, of course.\n And I'm also invited to lectures again and again.\n But this intensive consultation, of course, is about technical questions,\n about business questions.\n I don't have much idea about that in detail.\n If you say you hold lectures, do you hold lectures in China?\n Sometimes, but mostly in Germany.\n Could it be that Chinese are in charge of you? Tell us something about the strange Germans.\n No. Well, if at a university. A lecture at a university where it's about how the Germans see certain things.\n But mostly I tell the Germans how the you explain how they see the world?\n You can't do that with 80 million Germans.\n Yes, you can. There are certain tendencies. So, quite obviously, the Germans are different from the French and that can be called that. And the same way Chinese are different from other Asians, but also Asians from the West.\n Of course you can't completely generalize that, that's clear, but there are certain trends. For example, to give a very general example, the relationship between\n individual and community. In Asian societies this tends more to\n community. In Western societies this tends more to the individual. And these are\n for example different perspectives that lead to different that you act differently, think differently. And you can describe that.\n And since we know so little about China,\n you can describe it for a while\n before you get to the point where people in Beijing\n and Shanghai are different\n and the people in South China are different.\n There we have to learn\n this general perspective change first.",

Yes, I explained it three times, and you say we've already dealt with it before.\n I don't see any border violation at all in the surveillance of public spaces.\n I'm talking about China and how China monitors its population. Is there...\n That's almost an insult, if you tell the German Prime Minister that the rules of China are not rules at all, that's a whim, and say that we're in danger, that's absurd.\n Don't be mad at me, I'm a relaxed person, but that's absurd.\n But China serves as a scary example of what we shouldn't do here in the West, in Europe.\n We don't do that.\n But we could get to that idea. There are some right-wing radicals in Europe,\n such as Orb\u00e1n, who might soon apply it. Who knows? I was very much in the area of assumptions, rumors, half-hearted prognoses.\n I wanted your principles.\n I conveyed my principles. for a very liberal attitude,\n how people shape their social life.\n I would always be against snorting and so on.\n And I added to it, if it's about your life,\n about your health,\n because some people might think they have to\n tie you together. Or your property, the protection of the apartment. By the way, we have\n the housing breakdowns at the lowest level for ten years. You can't say that\n has affected the freedom of the people. We have simply promoted more\n security measures in apartments and we have equipped the police with more facilities and increased the punishment, the possible punishment for housing violations.\n This is a good example that comes to mind by chance.\n We protect property there.\n And if you talk to people who have been broken in, what this causes to these people, it goes into the intimate sphere.\n When the whole apartment is rusted, when personal things are stolen.\n That's the protection of freedom.\n Now you know how I feel when you can read my WhatsApp messages.\n It's the same for me.\n Yes, that too follows clear rules.\n Like here, the police officer or the police can't get into the apartment without a judge, I'll say that again.\n And here we have the same rules on the Internet, on the phone, on SMS.\n That's the basic philosophy, and it's light years away from your Chinese model.\n Just to China, Huawei is a topic right now. What position do you take?\n There is one in the Bundestag, party-wide coalition, Huawei should be excluded from our 5G infrastructure.\n Are there other opinions?\n Yes, we are even responsible for it.\n Many claim that they are responsible for digital, but we do it.\n We have a triangle here, so to speak. The first is the explanation of the firm, which must sign ten or more points that guarantee and comply with them.\n They can promise you everything, right?\n That's why it would be too little on its own. The technology that you use is certified by our Federal Office for Security in Information Technology,\n a top authority that is absolutely international.\n And the third is, if the company is disrupted because it gives a false statement, because it\n manipulates or updates the certified product afterwards, for example,\n when it is installed.\n Then we can suspend the operation.\n This is our suggestion to the the company."

And it is also important that this debate is once conducted.\n But I think we explain too little system theoretically, namely what is actually behind it, behind the\n construction of right-wing networks throughout Europe and not only in Europe, it goes,\n no idea, to Brazil, USA etc. and that probably also fulfills a function\n that everything is now being deposited in the east and somehow it generally plays a too small role in the debates about the AfD.\n I would like to ask a follow-up question.\n Because I think you also pointed out, Anette, that you say that right-wing radicalism and xenophobia had already existed in the GDR,\n and that was precisely because they were not discussed, they were taboo topics.\n That is precisely why they lived under one surface, developed and then find now,\n you are right, what is now being implemented structurally by the West,\n finds a ground that has developed since the founding of the GDR.\n Personal experience, I was the first journalist in the GDR in 1983.\n We were in Dresden in the evening in a pub,\n you were immediately recognized as Westerners.\n And the very first thing that someone from the Young Dresdner said to us after five minutes was,\n do you actually know that there is an insanely strong neo-Nazi scene here in Dresden?\n And do you know that one of the main characters of this neo-Nazi scene is the son of a high-ranking SED-functionary of Robotron.\n So really, at that time, the GDR elite.\n Apparently everyone in Dresden knew, at least in the youth scene,\n they told us that after five minutes, but it was not an official topic at all.\n If this experience, which is now my personal one, is correct structurally, Annette, and is it so that the suppressed but existing right-wing radicalism that existed in GDR conditions is now being shared in election results for the AfD? Yes, you actually already said that.\n I can only underline that.\n And it was so that, so to speak,\n against this kind of\n over-actuated anti-fascism,\n where you had the feeling\n that you had to be anti-fascist\n and were always forced to do so.\n That's why you have to go to the army in the GDR.\n That's why you have to work hard and that's why you have to always be loyal to the GDR.\n And also the wall, the anti-fascist protection vote,\n of course, also has such a counter-movement,\n a psychological counter-movement,\n that, for example, in my school, people\n just ripped crosses into the bank as an aversion against this\n incriminating, which did not always go hand in hand with Nazi ideology.\n But then later on.\n And there were very explicit Nazi groups.\n And it was often the children of the\n officials, because it was the most possible resistance for them. And the problem was, of course, that it was never processed.\n Thank you for letting me take a seat here, Hans H\u00fctt.\n Five years ago, I was also on Thilo's side as an elder statesman at Thilo's side for five years.\n I'd like to talk about a historically comparable perspective that reminds the West of a similar role,\n as it seems to be playing today in the East.\n On 10 November 1989 I flew from Frankfurt am Main to West Berlin.",
      "And yes, I'll share that, of course, it's not a question, but it is\n one that concerns the entire country. And therefore maybe that's why my\n positive opinion is that we are in the actual questions that concern us long ago\n met more together, absolutely together, and\n all sit, to put it bluntly, in the same boat and of course fight on the same side.\n That's why today was more of a, I think, a reflection loop, where I learned a lot.\n And I would like to say again, don't leave me here with all my notebooks alone.\n I brought you all the sheets again today with the text by Annette Simon.\n So please take them with you.\n On the one hand, the great chance that was missed 30 years ago, economically, was that it did not succeed and was not wanted by the West. that in a collapsing GDR economy, forms of community,\n for me, of community production and distribution\n were made possible.\n That would have been possible.\n The pressure within the GDR,\n also the pressure of despair,\n was big enough that one could have done that.\n That was not wanted by the West,\n also by the West German\n Left, which was in no way prepared for or prepared for the fact that\n a historical opportunity arose here. That was neither the radical West German\n Left nor was it the SPD, if you want to count them. None of them. And then\n only Helmut Kohl remained the only one\n who said on the one hand with his jacket diplomacy and Gorbachev and Reagan on the other hand,\n now let's do it. That was the missed historical great opportunity. What was\n a demand and a temptation for the GDR citizens\n is exactly what is now, and that is also an irony of the story,\n for the West German automobile industry is on the agenda.\n The industrial production in the GDR,\n at least 30% of the jobs were rationalized.\n The same is true of the large West German automobile production and other large industries.\n That's why they have the right to such a great concern, oh god,\n when electromobility comes and we don't build a combustion engine with, I don't know, 4,000 parts,\n but an electric motormotor with 400?\n Where do people go? The chance is perhaps to learn from what was left in the GDR at that time,\n left behind by the West German entrepreneurs, to say, let's not make this mistake again, but let's go the other way.\n And the very last point I want to make is that the successes of, I'll just call them right-wing populists, and globally, has a common denominator. They make for people who are insecure in their existence,\n retarding security promises.\n They tell them and claim,\n we are creating a future for you,\n which corresponds to your idea of the past,\n which has never been like that.\n And where that is affecting, this affecting\n and this success is an indication\n that the offers, the crisis management\n or processing offers\n of the democratic parties and unions\n and so on are not sufficiently expressed.\n And I am completely with Naika Ferruhtan.\n There it only helps I'm completely with Naika Ferruhtan.\n It only helps when radical offers are made,\n and those that include realisation plans.\n These are not clouds and cocoons,\n but they have to, for example,\n the automotive industry and other industries,\n they have to approach the present state and say,\n how is the development, which wants to be painful,\n which now also encourages all the other dimensions that DDR citizens have already experienced,\n this has to be a realistic plan.\n If that doesn't happen, then we will experience that the AfD is everywhere or others,\n not only at 25, but at 30, I don't know how many percent.\n So that's the learning provocation and I hope that we can handle it.\n Has anyone even whistled? There even get whistled for yourself.\n I've never experienced that either.\n Unfortunately, I'm not as optimistic as Melanie,\n although I'm an optimistic person,\n because if we assume that we would now sit in the year 2049\n and think, oh, 30 years, then we can actually,\n we already know that we are losing our chances again.\n We already know, Albrecht just mentioned it,\n our current government, the current society of the majority,\n is refusing to change its intention.\n We can forget the right and the Nazis, they are waiting for the catastrophe.\n Andreas Kemper explained this wonderfully at Jungnaiv."

      "You spoke about South Africa earlier.\n I have already talked about this question in November 2018.\n Long before Amnesty International published a 240-page study last year\n and a year before that the other big international human rights organization,\n Human Rights Watch, did the same. I said the following. First sentence, I think you should make the effort,\n or the first sentence was, between past situations and current situations there can always be many similarities, but there are always specific differences.\n That's why it's my effort to find new terms for current situations. That was sentence 1. the international court of law defined apartheid in its statute in article 2.\n The member states that founded it, in 1998.\n And if you consider the criteria that were decided for apartheid there as situation as a film, you can come to the conclusion that not only in the\n occupied areas, even in Israel itself, there is an apartheid situation. I then said third,\n I still plead for it. Also no comparisons with the Nazi era, that is forbidden anyway,\n generally, and when I hear that from the mouth of Germans, I always have the feeling that it is\n an attempt to relieve the crimes of my own ancestors.\n So my effort is to continue to find new terms.\n Above all, I don't see the political added value that this situation brings,\n to describe it as an apartheid situation.\n I don't think you win anything with that.\n So in terms of apartheid, but the term would be wrong.\n So, the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty have come to the exact same conclusion in detailed studies over 240 pages,\n as I said in 2018, it is in the definition of the criminal court,\n so you could do it, but as I said, it doesn't bring any added value and I always try to find new, independent terms.\n Last question about Israel, Palestine.\n The federal government still insists on the one-state solution, as a binational state or as a federation?\n I was invited by Medico International in 2009, a big humanitarian organization in Israel and Palestine to visit their projects there.\n And I was there with the German cabaretist Georg Schramm, we were only three of us,\n he wanted to get to know the situation. And one day we visit Moshe Zuckermann,\n who was still a professor at the university in Tel Aviv at the time. You think representative office,\n nothing, a closed box without a window.\n Here is the Zuckermann, here three smuggled garden plastic students with Thomas Gebauer,\n that was the managing director of Medico, Georg Schramm and me.\n And behind us are enlarged, pixelated three newspaper photos.\n Karl Marx, Hegel and Karl Valentin.\n And in this conversation, yes I wish there was a camera team there,\n in this conversation with us, Moshe Sukerman always refers to one up there and says,\n there Olle Karl was right and Georg Schramm always, yes, which Karl do you mean now?\n And in this conversation, May 2009, I talked to Sukerman,\n because I wanted Schramm to get as much information as possible about the situation.\n How would it be with the two-state solution? He got really angry and said, leave me alone.\n I said, I want to know what other opportunities there are. He said, you can forget it, look at the situation. There is no chance.\n But I was hard-nosed and provoked him for so long until he said, well, then I'll say it.\n Then an Israeli government has to tell the illegal settlers, you have to pack and move. Of course, replacement space in Israel must be provided.\n And then, now everything is Otto and Sukkermann, 80% will be There are similar conflicts of war with at least 200 dead on both sides.\n That is the price it would cost to implement the two-state solution.\n You have to know that beforehand.\n And he thought it was completely unrealistic.\n Two new ones.\n Meanwhile, he wrote a book, came out three or four years ago,\n where he comes back to the two-state solution.\n And probably for the tactical reason I see.\n So far, it is the United Nations international decision in the UN, in the USA,\n still with us, even if you can say that Washington has never done much for it,\n but it has been the official position.\n Trump has questioned it a bit, but Biden turned back.\n That's why you should hold on to it.",
      "And in Turkey, that was also done through the media, that a workshop was organized to arrest.\n Peter Steudtner, the German-American lawyer, was also there and was in custody at the time.\n And several of our colleagues in Turkey were involved.\n And Taner Kilic was sentenced to six years in prison.\n That's our colleague in Turkey.\n So it affects us very strongly.\n This is a question I'll ask at the end.\n What happens when it becomes known, and you also communicate this,\n that your activists, your colleagues, when they are then also caught by state, I call it now,\n suppression apparatus, does that mean that there is then an increased solidarity with you,\n that there is increased donation, that people say more and more, now I'm doing it too,\n or do some of them withdraw because they think it's too hot?\n I don't know if that leads to increased donations or something like that. I can't really judge that. I knew who knows about it with us, but I never asked the question.\n But we do notice solidarity. of course, we also approach this politically,\n we have talked a lot with the Executive Office about the situation of our colleagues in Turkey and in India.\n This does cause a resurgence, but of course it is not always the case that the situation is really immediately improved.\n What is happening on site is of course another number. If it becomes dangerous on site to apply for human rights,\n to get involved in Amnesty, that is of course a very difficult decision for the people,\n whether they still want to make that personal decision.\n Yes. On the sofa it is easier to be a hero.\n Yes, it is definitely easier for me than for colleagues in other countries.\n I mean myself, I sometimes think that I sit on the more comfortable chairs in Germany.\n Then someone in the chat asks, I am half Egyptian myself, he writes and says, that's why I'm very interested, do you have concrete figures about human rights violations in Egypt?\n So politically inhibited interference in the work of journalists, torture, do you have that?\n Yes, we have. As I said, I'm not a regional representative, but I do advertising and have an outdated edition with me. I've been in the home office for a year.\n This is an edition from 2014, 2015,\n that I found with us from our annual report.\n So once a year we publish a report\n about the human rights situation in all countries in the world.\n I write a chapter on this for the Deutschland Kapitel.\n It is well researched\n and of course there is also a long chapter on Egypt.\n And if you don't want to have it as a book, you can read these annual reports on amnesty.de\n and see how the situation was in Egypt for the last year.\n And basically similar to that,\n is there an index of human rights violations\n in or through certain states?\n For example, there is the Press of press freedom by Reporter ohne Grenzen.\n Do you have something like that about human rights violations in terms of political prisoners, political prisoners in prison?\n We have included this annual against a list of the worst A3 rankings.\n Every human rights violation is bad for itself.\n In this respect, we have nothing that is similar to the index of the colleagues of Reporter ohne Grenzen.\n But we have the annual report where you can really make a decision for every country. The last question.\n In what extent does, this is a bit speculative, but why not,\n do you think the corona crisis leads to more strict surveillance institutions, facilities, applications?\n Yes.\n Yes?\n Yes, that's not speculative yet, you can show that.\n So, for example, well, there is always a particularly clear example in China,\n where a series of apps were developed that were then needed to climb trains or enter certain public spaces.\n There was one that then had an algorithmically calculated code of your risk of infection,\n but also shared the data with the police.\n Then further expansion of video surveillance,\n which was combined with thermal scanning, i.e. to measure your temperature.\n Monitoring technology that was used to see if people were in quarantine.\n And then there are also a number of countries that have developed a corona app like Germany,\n but which in Germany they have then relied on a decentralized model and have put a lot of effort into it.\n We looked at a number of Corona apps at the time, for example the one from Qatar, which was extremely problematic and was basically a mass surveillance instrument for the population."

    "query": "What is the role of the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung (KBV) in determining the prices for medical services in Germany and how does it differ from a free market system?",
    "response": "\nThe KBV plays a significant role in negotiating contracts with health insurance companies, which ultimately influence the prices for medical services in Germany. It aims to create a balance between fair pricing and ensuring accessibility to healthcare for all. However, this system differs from a free market system as it involves collective bargaining and adherence to agreements made within the framework of the healthcare industry. The KBV recognizes the challenges of implementing a pure market approach in healthcare due to factors such as demographics, geographical distribution, and varying levels of specialization among medical professionals.",
    "contexts": [
      "But in Germany the price is the same everywhere. Why? Then you can change that.\n We would like to change that, but since we are not alone ...\n The KBV would like it like the pizzerias.\n I would of course like to dictate the prices. That would be a very convenient situation,\n in a reasonable way. But it's not that simple.\n I told you at the beginning, we have this so-called collective contract.\n So we have this contractual relationship with the health insurance companies.\n It has now developed further to the point that it is analogous to the health insurance association,\n also a GKV-headquarter, i.e. a legal health insurance headquarter.\n There is also one here in Berlin, around the corner.\n And with that we have to get it out of the way.\n And there is equality of voices, so you can easily imagine how difficult that is.\n And because it is often unsolvable, there is still a schiedsgremium and then it is decided who has more right in one or the other year.\n And in that respect it is a constant struggle and not really comparable to the free market.\n But you can dream.\n But is it even meaningful to talk about a market when it comes to doctors,\n when it comes to the health and care of people?\n That's exactly the discussion that always arises. We have that, in principle,\n you have to say, we used to have a situation that was completely different in many areas.\n Hospitals were originally almost always mildly operated. They never earned money in\n the earlier days, were sponsored by rich citizens or. They never earned money. In the earlier times they were sponsored\n by rich citizens or the church or something. Nowadays the market has been brought into health care,\n also in hospitals. They are supposed to bring profitability, they are supposed to calculate. You can do that,\n it's always a bit difficult. In this respect I share the assessment. Market and health are things\n that don't always fit together well. And I think you have to weigh that well.\n You have to define areas where the market is rather unfavorable and then there are certainly areas where the market would be acceptable from my point of view.\n Is there a market between the house doctor and the house nurse, the cashier?\n A market in what way?\n Yes, so one house doctor is a competitor to the other two.\n In theory, yes. If there were a lot of doctors, you would see that you have enough patients to get through.\n But since we have a higher need than the colleagues can cover, there is no competition.\n Everyone has more than enough to do.\n I looked, in Berlin there are a lot of doctors, cash doctors compared to Brandenburg.\n How can that be?\n Well, now you could of course say quite blatantly, it is also a certain question of the demography.\n We currently have 3.5 million inhabitants in Berlin, Brandenburg just under 2.1 million.\n And Brandenburg loses 200,000 people to Berlin every 10 years Brandenburg just under 2.1 million and Brandenburg loses\n in the middle every 10 years 200,000 people to Berlin, so they just leave. Brandenburg\n is of course large, area-wise enormously large, thin-settled, which of course always\n represents a challenge. That is also a problem for us or more for the KVs,\n who have to solve that, who also have to ensure the security,\n so that treatment is required and possible everywhere.\n You are obliged to do this, right? Not the health insurance?\n Exactly, we are obliged to do this.\n But you just said health insurance.\n No, the health insurance association.\n Oh, okay.\n I may have been snorting. No, it's the health insurance association.\n And the larger the country is and the thinner it is settled, the more challenging it is, of course.\n And it is actually clear, because a medical practice also needs a certain amount of people to be able to calculate.\n This is different for each group of professionals. The dentists need the least population share, because everyone should go to the dentist.\n And the more specialized, the greater the population share, because you rarely go to a radiologist or even less often to a nuclear medicine doctor. That means I need a certain amount of people to make such a practice bearable.\n And the thinner a country is, the larger the course of the way to be covered.",
      "Could the KBV members change that? The KBV could, because then a contract would be issued, say that's too much or too little.\n The whole has earned less.\n Or more or the same. And in that respect, it's a question of how to agree and whether\n you say, well, we think it's okay or not.\n It's also legitimate if the law enforcement says,\n I think the judge is stupid or he earns too much.\n You can of course formulate that that way.\n But at the end of the day you have to let the court choose\n and say, I'll decide with it.\n I have a few questions about the position of the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung.\n The topic of civil insurance.\n It's a topic in politics again and again.\n It didn't come up because the FDP is in the government,\n but the Greens, the Left, the SPD want one insurance for all.\n Now we not only have two classes of medicine with private insured and legal insured,\n but also about 100 legal health insurance companies. Why don't we do one?\n You have to ask the health insurance companies.\n What is your position?\n I don't care how many health insurance companies there are at the end of the day.\n Although I would put the thesis that the competition is actually the business at that point.\n If it were possible for the health insurance companies to do more competition for their insurance companies,\n i.e. in the clear text, to, better supply for the same amount of money. That has grown historically.\n That's why we have so many health insurance companies, because it has developed over many years.\n For example, it used to be that large companies had their own health insurance companies for their employees.\n You still know BKK. There are not many anymore, but BKK VW is still there, for example.\n There were many hundreds, of course,KKVW, for example, still exists. And there were many hundreds, which are of course increasingly shrunk,\n because even from a certain number of employees, such a health insurance is simply not financed.\n In this respect, a considerable shrinking process has already taken place.\n I would also think that it would probably be even less.\n But I don't know if you should wish that there is a unit insurance.\n From the insurance point of view, I think it's better if there are several,\n who then also have the opportunity to put themselves under pressure from each other to get the best out of the supply chain.\n It doesn't have to be a disadvantage for insurers.\n Anti-citizens insurance?\n I think the citizens insurance, in my personal opinion, will never come. It wouldn't come if the SPD had the absolute majority because it is hardly feasible in that which is often forgotten, the public insurance does not change anything at all.\n Because Sven still insures infants privately today. That means, until that really works, I'm probably not living anymore and you're in retirement age.\n So that's not what changes anything at all. I see it relatively emotionless. In countries where there is public insurance, doctors earn better. That's something you have to know.\n That surprised me too. We analyzed it.\n The discussion that comes every few years is like a dead man.\n Whenever there is a election, there is a public insurance.\n And we found that in all countries with state health systems, the private share of people paying from their pockets is much higher than with us. But what I personally would consider to be useful, I would actually, with the health insurance,\n an analog, maybe a little bit to the Kfz insurance, I would take the private ones with me.\n Then you would have the argument actually\n that you have to offer such a compulsory insurance range to a comparable tariff,\n in my opinion also without health check-up. And then you can put your ideas on it\n and you can buy them or not.\n If someone says I want to insure myself against falcons and want to insure Botox, I can do that.\n But it can't be the task of the solidarity community.\n So I think you can make a competition and then the boundaries would be a little bit washed away.\n And two-class society in terms of medicine?\n No, I don't think there is. There is a very simple example. If I operate and I do two cross-stitches, one is private and the other is legal insured, the operation is exactly the same.\n But the price is not.\n The price is unfortunately almost the same."

He was a doctor.\n So whenever we met driving, I was driving my car in Ramallah, in Gaza, but with false plates.\n So whenever we met, he stopped in the middle of the street to get out of the car and to\n tell me, oh, thank you that you are here because this shows how it is not unsafe, which is\n in a way true.\n Palestinians are very, in general, if I can generalize, they are amazingly easygoing. I think that Israel knows it. It could have been so easy to come to terms if we really respected them.\n If we really...\n If Israel really wanted to have peace or some kind of...\n Look, I have a list of words that I hate.\n The first one is Oslo.\n The second one is peace.\n The third one is process.\n The fourth one is reconciliation, etc.\n And lately I added to the list the word solution.\n Because you know better than I know that there is no final solution or\n there is but it's only one and we are not talking about nothing in history is\n final so the thing is what how do we advance to a better a better phase in\n history that will help us prevent disasters to now we are now we are\n talking about the possibility to reach phases\n of disasters and we want to stop it and palestinians were ready for something which is\n fair and which is dignified but israel did everything from almost the first day of oslo\n israel did everything everything possible to uh to impose a surrender over on Palestinians, not a treaty, not an agreement, but a surrender.\n So it is a war of attrition.\n What we've been seeing for the last 25 years is a war of attrition against the Palestinians.\n So back to Ramallah for a moment.\n How has life changed here?\n Has it gotten better in the last couple of years, the last 20 years?\n I mean, you haven't been to Gaza, of course, because you can't get in anymore.\n So it's hard to talk about life in Gaza.\n One of the main Israeli, I think, achievements is to create these pockets of Palestinian realities.\n So you cannot talk about one Palestinian reality.\n So there are pockets, very different pockets.\n So Ramallah, of course, is the best example, but it's the worst example because I call\n Ramallah a five-star prison.\n It is, you know, like we are here, we don't feel the occupation here.\n But if you go two kilometers to the east, you get to a checkpoint.\n And then two and a half kilometers, a military position.\n And then the biggest military camp in the West Bank, Israeli military camp."

      "They have relatively small amounts of cut-off.\n And that leads to the fact that, for example, biometric surveillance, such as face recognition technology, is not even particularly acceptable.\n That means that the European Union, when it is implemented, human rights do not play a role.\n And so they can end up in Xinjiang.\n I had written down at EU Dual Use that manufacturers must first check themselves\n whether their products, such as this facial recognition software, can violate human rights.\n And only when it is clear that it violates human rights,\n then they have to show it. If it is only possible or even likely, then they don't have to.\n That is listed. That means you look to see if your product is on the list. There are categories\n of products on it and you look to see if one falls below that. And that's maybe what you mean\n with checking yourself first.\n You have to see if your product is on the checked list.\n What hasn't happened so far is that you have to look beyond that.\n Okay, I have a good one here, it's not on the list.\n It's face recognition technology.\n Great, it's not on the list.\n I want to export it to China.\n Hmm, maybe not such a good idea. I'll take a look at the human rights law in China. I'll take a look at Amnesty's annual report, for example, at how the human rights law in China is and how technology is used there.\n And if I see a risk, I'll turn to BAFA, the Federal Office for Economic and Exchange Control,\n and ask for a test and a permit, even if I'm not actually on the list with this product. This is a standalone due diligence test that has not been provided before,\n for which we have done a lot of work and where we have also made a certain success.\n The EU-Dulius-Order has been reformed and now there is such a due diligence test.\n And that it also applies to the definitions of surveillance technology,\n that it is only about hidden surveillance technologies and not open ones?\n Yes, we had a lot of conversations about that.\n We were very much committed to the fact that this word, covered, is used.\n Why did they include it?\n The official argument is that it would otherwise be too difficult to distinguish, for example,\n the facial recognition of your cell phone.\n You are still able to export cell phones with a face that automatically distracts you when you look inside,\n without having to make an application at the Wafaa every time.\n We were of the opinion that it is very easy to distinguish between the identifying and verifying facial recognition technology.\n One is the one that just checks if you are it.\n And the other one answers the question,\n is this the person she is pretending to be?\n And the image I have saved here,\n and it is looking for this single match\n and the identifying facial recognition technology.\n That's where you put a camera on the street\n and it scans all people\n and tries to find out who these people are.\n And the camera is an open surveillance measure?\n Exactly, that's why we used it.\n It doesn't fall down?\n So that's a typical job we do.\n Besides writing letters, we also look at these legal texts and say, hey, there's a cover in here.\n And then we did research.\n We published this report, said European companies are delivering face recognition technology to Xinjiang.\n There we see massive human rights problems and risks. We have covered this report here, please spell the word, so that also visible surveillance technology is basically authoritative.\n They didn't do that. They didn't do that, but they still have the possibility to take on biometric surveillance, if they want to.\n Another limited progress of the reform of this export regime for surveillance technology was was that there is a European list. I just said that until now...\n The watch list?\n Exactly, right.\n Until now, Europe simply exported the list from the Vassna agreement.\n That means Europe could only control export things\n that Russia and Turkey want to control.\n Because, as I said, it can't be that Europe can't grow beyond that\n and can say, we also take our own list of goods and say,\n we in the European Union want to control biometric surveillance systems beyond that.\n And there is such a list now, but it is not binding and it is not yet clear what will be on it.\n It has a declaratory character.\n Yes, that's funny.",
      "I think every German, especially the former GDR citizens, know how the Stasi worked and worked.\n Is that comparable in any way to the Chinese surveillance state and the Chinese intelligence service?\n Of course it is comparable, but it is completely different in multiple ways.\n The most important difference is that surveillance works electronically and via data.\n That's a huge difference.\n So you don't take samples of people, put them in glasses and then put them in dogs' noses.\n You have cameras, you have access to data and can let people become glasses from that data.\n Stasi would have form of surveillance.\n You can monitor a lot more people. You can monitor much more comprehensively than was possible with a stasis.\n However, and this is what you have to see, it is a much more plural\n and much more transparent society.\n So people can leave the country, they can come back,\n they are internationally educated.\n So that's a big difference to the GDR.\n The Stasi lived from being\n locked up. That's not the case in China.\n Are you being watched?\n Certainly.\n Certainly? Did you get that? That's the worst thing about this surveillance, that you don't notice it.\n It's not like someone is running three meters behind you.\n That's still there, but that's very rare.\n But the surveillance consists in taking a face from a computer, a face from a lot of things, and then an algorithm can trace the way of a person in the city.\n You have a camera, then it goes in a certain direction, there are five new cameras, you control them and then a film is cut from it.\n You have to wear a mask.\n I would have to wear a mask. That was a huge problem during the Covid times, because face recognition didn't work.\n And then you quickly started to develop in the direction of walking, so that you can recognize people walking. And that's a very big ambivalence, because this technology has enormous advantages.\n For example, when driving autonomously, which is already everyday in China, you can control the traffic a lot more. There are much less accidents.\n You can build electronic cages for cycling, so that it is impossible to\n drive over this bicycle. You can keep the distance to the cars. And it will\n maybe someday be in 30, 40 years, 10-year- olds will say, you could decide for yourself how fast you drive and how close you drive and when you turn.\n You're all crazy. That was totally dangerous. And then there were a lot of deaths.\n And then we'll say, back then it was normal. Like our parents say, it was normal that we drove without safety belts and smoked in the car.\n So I want to say that this technological development has an incredible potential for progress.\n But also abuse.\n But also this ambivalence, and you must never forget that.\n Is that a topic in China itself? In society?\n Yes, of course.\n Surprisingly less in relation to the state.\n But the Chinese are more afraid of the company than of the state.\n Here it's the other way around.\n Yes, 50-50.\n So you're also afraid of Google and Amazon and so on.\n But in China you have the great experience of a state that has enabled this gigantic boost of prosperity and thus also boost of freedom. made possible. It hasn't happened in history that so many people\n were freed from poverty\n and were released\n into a self-employed,\n middle-class life,\n so to speak.\n Where they can decide\n where they live, who they marry,\n which schools,\n where there is medical care,\n and so on.\n That is the basic experience of the state.\n And with the companies you have the feeling that they are pulling you over the table.\n And this mistrust has become so great that the state had to act\n and then it adopted the European Data Protection Act.\n Almost 1 to 1.\n The European Data Protection Act. Almost 1 to 1. The data protection basic order? The European data protection basic order.\n With a small exception.\n This law applies,\n comma,\n Not for a state.\n The state is allowed to do everything, comma.\n And then the most Chinese said,\n we can live with that.\n That's a step now.\n And now the handling of companies with data is regulated similarly strictly as in the west.\n And that's already a first step. The next step will inevitably come, we don't know when.\n That people will say, what does the state do with our data."

    "response": "\nLars Feld believes that ideology in economics is formed through scientific knowledge and methods. These ideas and thought structures emerge from the brain, but over time, they become less significant due to the development of a mainstream that focuses on pragmatic alignment.

The goal is to create a human-worthy order by establishing the appropriate framework conditions to achieve desirable outcomes.",

      "And then also empirically verifies.\n And that's exactly how we work in economics.\n In this respect, we are a science, but it is a social science.\n That means we take care of ourselves by taking care of economic issues,\n partly beyond that, political or social,\n about the social.\n That is the object we are analyzing.\n And social sciences are also different from natural sciences,\n because we can build to a lesser extent,\n as it is statistically called, on the law of the large number.\n This means, there was a follow-up question,\n if it is social science,\n doesn't economics automatically have parts of ideology.\n And ideology is not used as a negative term, but as ideas and thought structures that are based on this scientific knowledge and their methods.\n Ideas and thought structures always the brain, we know that. But what you see in the course of time is that they have become less important.\n That we get a mainstream that is pragmatically aligned and actually always goes ahead in these smaller steps.\n So science is often just a sequence of small steps. That you have a certain question that theoretically resulting, which has also occurred in practice,\n where one says that the connection should be causal and then we check it empirically.\n And especially the empirical examination is something that forces you to get rid of the thought structures\n and to see what it looks in reality. But isn't it, the school to which you would orientate yourself, if I understand this correctly,\n so autoliberalism in a modern form,\n doesn't build on the idea that it would make sense to make as few concrete regulations as possible for the actors of the economic process as few concrete guidelines as possible,\n but to let them act.\n That's a bit of an ideology, an idea of what is good and right in the running.\n So autoliberalism or orderly economics means to make economic policy rule-oriented.\n That does not mean with as few restrictions as possible,\n as you have now formulated, but that means with reasonable restrictions.\n So to ask, how do I have to set the framework conditions\n to get a good result?\n Eucken has formulated it nicely, it is about creating a human-worthy order.\n Yes, but exactly, human-worthy.\n And there are also a whole series of follow-up questions\n that refer to the fact that you said\n we don't have an ecological crisis,\n so no climate crisis,\n but we can handle all of this.\n We have instruments.\n They say, sorry,\n we have already had global warming.\n We are now fighting to reach the 1.5 degree target.\n Hardly anyone thinks that this is still to be achieved.\n We are in the middle of a crisis.\n What kind of crisis term do you have, is asked,\n if you call it a crisis only when the poop is steaming\n and the cart hangs on the wall.\n Yes, that is a crisis term.\n I think many would share it.\n So if we go back to medicine, for example,\n I just said that I was working as a caretaker in psychiatry,\n then we also take the crisis as a phenomenon\n that actually only occurs during the collapse.\n So then when the difficulty is there.\n And typically you try to heal in the next step and do something about it.\n Of course, this can be so serious crises as the climate crisis can become,\n can it be that we can no longer correct it.\n That means, as long as I still have the opportunity to preventively change something in advance\n so that it doesn't get worse and we don't have the collapse, then I think we are not yet in the crisis.\n But is the work, as you understand it, of the economist, also of the political economist, who you are, also controlled by the fact that he says we have to recognize crisis symptoms early on and see that we can preventively counter-control a time when the crisis is about to break out.\n Is that the task?\n Yes, we have to recognize in advance what is happening to do something about it,\n so that we do not get such a collapse of the systems.\n What does that mean? That was also a direct question of the following for the crisis we are in.\n The pandemic is directly linked to an economic question.\n How is the No-Covid approach to evaluating the economic and scientific perspective? Three weeks of a hard lockdown and then we can open again compared to what we have had for a year.\n A bit of a lockdown. Where is the damage and the benefit greater?\n That's a more difficult question.",
      "The AfD is perceived to me as quite neoliberal, but that's another topic.\n That would be another topic, how to explain to the AfD.\n Explain to our audience what you understand about neoliberalism, so that you can follow.\n Exactly, the neoliberal project is the slim state.\n The individual is responsible for himself.\n There is a minimalistic arrangement, so law and order.\n Safety is ensured. So here it doesn't matter what's going on in the swimming pool.\n But there must be law and order.\n So the police and army must be there.\n Exactly, that is very important.\n That the state should be in charge.\n Exactly, the state may also save the banks, but that's not always communicated openly.\n That's only in financial crises, suddenly quite naturally, because banks and others are suddenly system relevant.\n But the neoliberal project is indeed the slim state that takes care of law and order, that appeals to its own responsibility\n and that sees itself as a slave to ideological positions or political ideas.\n It's not about thinking visionary or even utopian anymore,\n but rather to analyse pragmatically, soberly, technologically what is currently necessary.\n What role does the market play in neoliberalism?\n The market?\n The markets.\n The markets. The markets. We know that.\n That's the misinterpretation of Adam Smith, the famous invisible hand.\n The market rules itself.\n And this idea of how the market rules itself and regulates itself, that's fantastic,\n would neoliberal thinkers say.\n Although they are often more thinkers.\n That's wonderful. That's the way it is in\n societies, it's already regulated by itself. So what else do you want to take\n responsibility for people who are socially, politically, ideologically, culturally, gender-specific, religiously disadvantaged.\n If you say a slim state, is that a right framing, a right word to speak of slim?\n Because slim implies something positive.\n I think in a beauty image, a heteronormative beauty image, sexy is also slim.\n Sure. You want to sell yourself as sexy.\n And we all want a sexy state.\n Yes, yes.\n What do you have against a sexy, slim state?\n Well, you could also associate sexy with sexism.\n You know what I mean.\n Yes, of course I know what you mean.\n Is the term slim state the right one?\n Well, of course it also means that you sell yourself accordingly.\n Especially in the neoliberal logic, in which, so to speak,\n that self-marketing is also a claim that is also directed at individuals.\n Hey, you just have to know how to sell yourself. So you also know, so to speak, as a theorist, in this thinking,\n which story to use so that it comes across sexy, attractive, as you say. And it\n also goes hand in hand with promises. Optimize yourself and you can become anything. And maybe realize, but people, sometimes only on a subconscious level, that this promise doesn't work.\n This promise of recognition. Hey, if you only optimize yourself hard enough and improve, then all doors are open for you. And it's the libertarian term of freedom,\n anything goes.\n By the way, a term of freedom that we also\n find in the cross-thinking scene.\n So, freedom and\n you had just recently\n an exciting discussion on freedom just recently.\n You can define it in many different ways.\n I'm always a friend of Immanuel Kant.\n Freedom, I'll say it again in philosophical terms, and then I'll translate it.\n Freedom is the maxim that can be generally set.\n So freedom is not just me, me, me, me, me, me, and I don't care what's with the others,\n but freedom also has something to do with the relationship with others.\n Freedom is a relationship with other people and I can't demand my own freedom without\n denying it to all people as a general law.\n And that's something completely different than anything goes.\n But that means freedom also in responsibility.\n I just had a few days ago a conversation with Konstantin Kuhlh\u00fct.\n He wouldn't say anything goes, but he said freedom is, I can do what I want.\n If I want to do something, Nadja, I have to have the freedom to do it."

In terms of coal, China is a major producer and consumer, relying heavily on domestic resources. However, it has also increased its imports from countries such as Indonesia and Australia. When it comes to solar and wind power, China has rapidly expanded its renewable energy capacity, becoming a leading manufacturer and exporter of solar panels and wind turbines. It aims to increase its share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix. For nuclear power, China has also made efforts to develop its own nuclear technology and has plans to construct and operate more nuclear power plants in the coming years. As for natural gas, China is the world's largest gas importer, mainly reliant on pipeline imports from Central Asia, Russia, and Myanmar. Additionally, it has been increasing its LNG imports from countries such as Qatar and the United States.

      "So I would say not in the trend, but I\n would like to underline here that I would say in the trend, because, as I said, it is\n quite complicated and there are also quite strong regional differences.\n And of course there are models where provincial governments, companies make available whole wind parks and provide them with a guaranteed price.\n And that is definitely part of the industrial policy. Do manufacturers compete?\n We have different power providers here,\n they are sometimes the same if you look closely at the same companies,\n but we have a certain selection, city-states and so on.\n Is that also the case in China or is there only one? There is the national grid and then there is the south grid.\n But overall it is more concentrated and has a much stronger role in the public sector.\n It's not like you have an infinite number of private power or gas providers that offer the corresponding services on the market.\n There are also phenomena of different tariffs that customers can choose from,\n for example a green power tariff or something like that,\n where you try to offer choice options.\n But the overall structure is much more clearly dominated by public and state companies than in the German context.\n Does the Chinese state also subsidize all energy carriers?\n At our company, nuclear power is subsidized, coal is subsidized, solar and wind are general? I'm not an energy economist, I went there to understand how inflation is.\n But it also has a price.\n Exactly, it definitely has to do with it.\n I would say that overall in China there is a very pragmatic approach.\n And they say, on the one hand, you make a very aggressive expansion of renewable energies and on the other hand, you also receive the coal, because it is the most important inland energy reserve.\n And in the context of enormous geopolitical tensions, which also involves a very immediate security interest, that you say, okay, you receive the coal because that's what you have yourself.\n Then there are of course gas pipelines from Russia and of course there is also oil.\n So you have the whole energy mix and in all these areas the state is somehow involved.\n But the biggest impulse, I would say, in recent years is definitely been in the direction of renewables,\n where coal was kept and partly also expanded.\n I would say primarily from these security considerations and also from the background of what happened in 2021,\n where coal mines were quickly shut down coal mines very quickly.\n And then he was part of this energy crisis that had started in autumn 2021.\n I think I also learned from your interviews and from other interviews, also because of the change to LNG,\n also in Germany I learned that China is the largest gas importer in the world\n and Germany is now the third largest gas importer in the world.\n They don't import coal because they have too much, right?\n They do import coal, there were also these big conflicts with Australia, where it was temporarily suspended. They do import coal.\n But coal is the richest inland reserve. But there is also gas funding in China. I'm sure there will be a question from Isabella, if you don't know this, but why are they building so many new coal power plants?\n They have to stick to Paris and climate goals. Why are they building so many coal power plants?\n I think it has to do with the geopolitical situation. that you can only expand renewables that quickly. China is expanding very quickly and is very ambitious,\n but it has a certain speed that is prescribed with the technical limitations.\n And you still have the problem that you have very strong fluctuations in production. In Shandong, for example, where they have built out a lot of renewables,\n there were a few days in the last few months when the electricity prices were suddenly negative\n on the spot market.\n You can say that's not bad, but it's a problem for the people who produce electricity\n and indicates that there is not have enough storage capacity.\n Of course, coal is not good for storage either, because you cannot turn coal power plants on and off so quickly,\n because it is a rather, well, you can imagine, physically a rather serious matter.\n But I actually think that it is a very primary energy security issue.\n And at the same time, I think they build so many renewable energies,\n i.e. solar and wind, like the rest of us together.\n Something like that, yes.\n That's not bad either.",
      "There are not only supervisors, because we have citizen initiatives against land management and much more.\n And I think it would make sense to vote internationally.\n Europe has just 4% of the world's CO2 emissions.\n If we reduce that to 3% or 2%, the world will not help.\n Yes, but Europe does not have any can have role models for developing alternatives.\n But what role models do we have? Where do we have to be role models?\n We have to be role models for China, 24%, for India, a very high percentage, for Russia, for the USA.\n I don't know if China takes Europe as a role model.\n In China coal power plants are being built, nuclear power plants. Even the European Union says that nuclear power is a future model, only we Germans don't do that.\n It can be.\n It can be. I think it is easier internationally and if the European Union develops the technologies, so we invest in research, then we become a role model for others.\n But not when we decarbonize and the others see that it is not economically competitive.\n Well, there is also the thesis that says, when the critics come and say, we have pushed forward the development of solar technology here, we have developed it technologically and now China is building PV, photovoltaic panels, edge-page.\n Some say that this was actually the most useful form of development help\n that Germany has ever given.\n If the principle is correct, you can continue.\n Here it is developed and then it can be used and implemented in China or India.\n Yes, that is certainly feasible, but the question is whether the calculation actually works.\n Because if our know-how is implemented there, it also means that we will benefit from it.\n If the Chinese agree with it, they are welcome.\n We just experienced last week how intensively industrial and university espionage\n is carried out by China in Germany.\n That's why I'm careful that our knowledge doesn't go there and we have to buy it back for expensive money.\n So I think that a competition is useful and that we should focus on Africa.\n But wouldn't it matter to the climate where the protection comes from?\n Yes, but we Europeans are just making 4% of the world's emissions. And if we want to be technologists, we have to invest more in research and development.\n But we will have the effects if India, South Africa, if China decarbonize and also the USA.\n The Europeans are much further ahead than others. But do we take the others as an example? I had a conversation with the former Indian Minister of Environment a while ago about these questions.\n He said that we are already looking very closely at what Germany is doing.\n If you would do a project like this in India,\n then it would be possible that not only one energy park would be built out of renewables,\n but that we then scale that, that is exactly\n that of what is beyond this 2 or 4 percent limit.\n Yes, but that's exactly the point. Why does the German economy not invest in India,\n but in China? Because they have very easy implementations in China, because there is\n almost no corruption there. And because in India, a democratic country, completely right, a country that also in the broadest sense, apart from Modi with his oppression of Hindus, excuse me, of Christians and others, because China is incredibly corrupt, because India is incredibly corrupt, if they do something there, then they pay.\n China but also. The problem of corruption in China too. Yes, but I'll say the German industry\u2026 The problem of corruption in China is well known.\n Yes, I just want to make clear why you don't invest in India, because it's much worse there.\n Yes.\n So, of course, all good and bad\u2026\n That's now word about schism, so to speak, in a different direction.\n No, I'm not trying. So I just want to make it clear, of course we could do that, but we have a transfer of know-how to china so they are happy when they\n absorb knowledge from us and the important thing is that we are able to implement projects ourselves\n and we have had a panel industry, a panel industry that was highly subsidized but\n it did not get through the market and unfortunately we also have the expansion of renewables in\n germany very much at the expense of gas dependence from russia neglected the expansion of renewables in Germany due to the gas dependence on Russia.\n We shut down nuclear power plants, cheap gas from Russia and built many hamlets, also as a union, to promote renewables in Germany."

There are many colleagues who like to do that.\n But we have found that they are actually mostly...\n But they earn money in the city, right?\n They earn more, yes, that's one thing. But it is quite often the case that people are\n who come from the regions. So a certain community is there and there will certainly be\n some who grew up in the big city and say, I'm a fat fat guy, I want to have a little\n peace, I like to go to the country. So the country is not unattractive. There are high-attractive\n country regions and we don't have problems everywhere.\n That would be wrong.\n And we do in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n But not everywhere in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n Not in Rostock.\n No, not in Rostock.\n But Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is mostly not Rostock.\n If you get away from the water a little bit, it will be thinner settled.\n And then the roads would be longer.\n Mecklenburg-Western is huge.\n These are real routes, I know that. I've been there before.\n Beautiful, but there are also many areas.\n And that makes it difficult.\n What I want to say is that it will not lead to more colleagues being left in the country\n if I take them to the Zinstenplatz and say, you have to go there for two years.\n Because how is such a practice supposed to work?\n So I have to close a rental contract in a doubt for ten years, build a practice in there and say, after two years I'm gone again.\n I think the hope is that a few will say, I stay.\n Yes, but then I think you can tease them more.\n What we do, for example, or many medical students do, is that they actually do so-called country hospitations medical students and a lot of people say, I wouldn't have imagined that so exciting.\n So there are already possibilities. I think this national doctor's quota is more of a marketing gag.",
      "Why did you want to do it? Because of the salary?\n No, obviously not. It was a situation, I was delegated to Berlin as a member of the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung Nordrhein.\n That's a bit complicated now.\n The Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung elects a representative association from its members and they elect a board member.\n That means these are all active colleagues.\n Each Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung, that is legally regulated, then quotas to Berlin in the Kassen Kassen-Essi-Bundesvereinigung\n representative meeting. 60 people in the number. So that's a bit like Meck-Pomm H2, Nordrhein\n for example 5. And they then choose a board from their 60. He doesn't have to come from\n this circle, we can also take someone from the external. And I was in this representative meeting\n and at that time the former chairman of the board had a heart attack and could no longer exercise his office ad hoc.\n And then you needed a successor.\n And then he thought about it and thought about different options and then decided for me.\n Why did you do that?\n Are you such a big-mouthed person or what?\n I don't know.\n You can argue well.\n My sense of belonging, I think that was the problem back then, it was a very tense situation between different currents and to fill the graves a little bit, because I didn't have such a past from the system, so old animosities were not located with me in that form.\n What different trends are there at the KBV?\n Not so much anymore, but back then in the old days there was a very strong politicization between house and specialist doctors.\n It was, as you can imagine, mostly about money.\n It was the question back then, do the house or the specialist get too much or too little money.\n And then, for me, it became so self-sufficient that it actually made it difficult to work together in many ways.\n And the normal medical activity is not a house or specialist, but a joint one.\n And I think that was the reason why I saw someone in me who didn't bring that many old-timers.\n And that's how I got it.\n Do you have old-timers now?\n Well, well.\n Your name is now well known, right?\n Yes, we don't call them old-timers, but the longer you're in such an area, the more...\n Do you think you'll be voted again?\n That's what my colleagues will decide when the election starts. Do you want to will be elected again? My colleagues will decide that when the election is up.\n Would you like to do it again?\n I would do it again if they would elect me again.\n In the last episode, Gernot Marks was the president of the DVI.\n He does it for a living. Why don't you do it for a living?\n Why do you get half a million?\n That is actually a legal mistake.\n It was actually a job for civil service. You'll laugh. Until 2007, I think, it was professionalized.\n Before the election, the board of directors had five or seven heads and they were civil service colleagues from the KVN. So that's actually how it was established by the legislator.\n But the legislator doesn't say how much you earn?\n No.\n You decide for yourself that I pay you so much?\n Yes.\n Could you change that? If someone says, you can imagine, we got a lot of mail from doctors\n who said, Kasten earns too much. Could the KBV members change that? The KBV could, because then a contract would be issued, say that's too much or too little.\n The whole has earned less.\n Or more or the same. And in that respect, it's a question of how to agree and whether\n you say, well, we think it's okay or not.\n It's also legitimate if the law enforcement says,\n I think the judge is stupid or he earns too much.\n You can of course formulate that that way.\n But at the end of the day you have to let the court choose\n and say, I'll decide with it.\n I have a few questions about the position of the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung.\n The topic of civil insurance.\n It's a topic in politics again and again."

    "query": "What are the differences between the Chinese surveillance state and the Stasi in terms of methods and societal impact?",
    "response": "\nThe main difference between the Chinese surveillance state and the Stasi lies in the methodology used for surveillance. While the Stasi relied heavily on human agents collecting physical evidence and monitoring individuals, the Chinese surveillance system is predominantly based on electronic data collection and analysis using advanced technologies like facial recognition, camera networks, and algorithms. This shift has led to a more comprehensive and intrusive form of surveillance in China compared to the Stasi era. However, it's important to note that despite the differences in approach, both systems share similarities in terms of restricting individual freedoms and privacy.",
    "contexts": [
      "I think every German, especially the former GDR citizens, know how the Stasi worked and worked.\n Is that comparable in any way to the Chinese surveillance state and the Chinese intelligence service?\n Of course it is comparable, but it is completely different in multiple ways.\n The most important difference is that surveillance works electronically and via data.\n That's a huge difference.\n So you don't take samples of people, put them in glasses and then put them in dogs' noses.\n You have cameras, you have access to data and can let people become glasses from that data.\n Stasi would have form of surveillance.\n You can monitor a lot more people. You can monitor much more comprehensively than was possible with a stasis.\n However, and this is what you have to see, it is a much more plural\n and much more transparent society.\n So people can leave the country, they can come back,\n they are internationally educated.\n So that's a big difference to the GDR.\n The Stasi lived from being\n locked up. That's not the case in China.\n Are you being watched?\n Certainly.\n Certainly? Did you get that? That's the worst thing about this surveillance, that you don't notice it.\n It's not like someone is running three meters behind you.\n That's still there, but that's very rare.\n But the surveillance consists in taking a face from a computer, a face from a lot of things, and then an algorithm can trace the way of a person in the city.\n You have a camera, then it goes in a certain direction, there are five new cameras, you control them and then a film is cut from it.\n You have to wear a mask.\n I would have to wear a mask. That was a huge problem during the Covid times, because face recognition didn't work.\n And then you quickly started to develop in the direction of walking, so that you can recognize people walking. And that's a very big ambivalence, because this technology has enormous advantages.\n For example, when driving autonomously, which is already everyday in China, you can control the traffic a lot more. There are much less accidents.\n You can build electronic cages for cycling, so that it is impossible to\n drive over this bicycle. You can keep the distance to the cars. And it will\n maybe someday be in 30, 40 years, 10-year- olds will say, you could decide for yourself how fast you drive and how close you drive and when you turn.\n You're all crazy. That was totally dangerous. And then there were a lot of deaths.\n And then we'll say, back then it was normal. Like our parents say, it was normal that we drove without safety belts and smoked in the car.\n So I want to say that this technological development has an incredible potential for progress.\n But also abuse.\n But also this ambivalence, and you must never forget that.\n Is that a topic in China itself? In society?\n Yes, of course.\n Surprisingly less in relation to the state.\n But the Chinese are more afraid of the company than of the state.\n Here it's the other way around.\n Yes, 50-50.\n So you're also afraid of Google and Amazon and so on.\n But in China you have the great experience of a state that has enabled this gigantic boost of prosperity and thus also boost of freedom. made possible. It hasn't happened in history that so many people\n were freed from poverty\n and were released\n into a self-employed,\n middle-class life,\n so to speak.\n Where they can decide\n where they live, who they marry,\n which schools,\n where there is medical care,\n and so on.\n That is the basic experience of the state.\n And with the companies you have the feeling that they are pulling you over the table.\n And this mistrust has become so great that the state had to act\n and then it adopted the European Data Protection Act.\n Almost 1 to 1.\n The European Data Protection Act. Almost 1 to 1. The data protection basic order? The European data protection basic order.\n With a small exception.\n This law applies,\n comma,\n Not for a state.\n The state is allowed to do everything, comma.\n And then the most Chinese said,\n we can live with that.\n That's a step now.\n And now the handling of companies with data is regulated similarly strictly as in the west.\n And that's already a first step. The next step will inevitably come, we don't know when.\n That people will say, what does the state do with our data.",
      "What I don't think is necessary is to bring up the topic of Stasi.\n That's the wet dream of Stasi.\n They had to follow you to create a movement profile of you in the 80s.\n Now they can just call it off automatically.\n What do you know about Stasi?\n I've heard some things about it call the police. What do you know about the Stasi? I've heard some things in my family.\n I'd like to argue with you about the police law, but I find the comparison with Stasi, let's say, well, whatever, I don't want to go into the details,\n I think it's a problem for me, the comparison with the Stasi, I don't like it.\n But I know you want to talk about something else and I want to...\n It's about the surveillance options that have now been built and the basic rights of us have been restricted.\n I mean, you explicitly allowed,\n the police are on their way,\n explicitly allowed the secret recording of conversations in private apartments,\n no matter if it's a person's apartment,\n who is suspected of a future criminal offense or not.\n The police law itself,\n which was reformed, was from 1996.\n That means there was the pressure to create a police law to at least create the possibilities for the police and rights that are now given to the police by the police law, for example, would be a general right.\n As if they would now use this on purpose.\n It's just that they are given a legal basis for the use of these cases and not for the will.\n The decisive thing was also in the 96 law that it needed a concrete danger so that danger to use these instruments.\n Now the suspicion is enough.\n And that's a new, exciting change.\n Yes, but even suspicion is not an act of will.\n It's not like you say, okay, I'll take it this way and I'll use my feeling.\n Suspicion must also be a justified fact.\n You're admitting that the threshold for surveillance has been lowered?\n Yes, but the police law is only about the question of the legal basis, how to apply it.\n The basic problem I see is that, especially in Saxony, the police law is considered so critical in Saxony,\n because there is a fundamental distrust of the police in certain parts.\n And that's why I was for a police identification obligation, which was not feasible with the CDU.\n They are allowed to wear body cams.\n The obligation to sign is that they are individually signed.\n That's still not the case, right?\n Exactly, that was not feasible.\n What does that mean with the body cams?\n They are allowed to wear them?\n So the police can choose?\n The body cams can be used.\n Why don't you have to?\n I don't know that now. So I really don't know in detail whether there is a duty.\n I assumed that there is a possibility to use a bodycam.\n What I also found interesting, in Brandenburg the SPD made sure that the state trojan comes into the police law.\n The leftists managed to prevent it.\n And in Saxony the CDU wanted the state-runner to come.\n And you got him out.\n What's up there?\n Certainly someone who is the minister-in-chief is always striving to create more rules in the sense of the police than someone who is not the minister-in-chief.\n There is always this fight between security and freedom.\n That's the permanent question in the police law.\n And apparently the minister won here?\n He put things through and we prevented things.\n We put things through that they didn't want to.\n But things that ... So it's a compromise, it's not an easy compromise.\n There is currently a constitutional lawsuit against it.\n They are asking if what we...\n Can you repeat that?\n No, I think it's a fundamental right that someone who has doubts whether it is constitutional,\n that it is checked.\n And I think that because we have such possibilities, I don't criticize it.\n And if you find that there are things that are not constitutional,\n then you have to correct it logically.\n If you find that it is in accordance with the constitution,\n then you have apparently not made so many mistakes.\n So I don't criticize at all that someone goes the constitutional right way\n to check whether this actually in line with our constitution.\n That's a basic right."

    "query": "What are the arguments against privatizing the fire department, as discussed in the interview between Monika Schnitzer and Jung und Naiv, and what examples are given to illustrate potential negative consequences?",
    "response": "\nThe main arguments against privatizing the fire department revolve around concerns regarding efficiency, fairness, and maintaining the integrity of state-mandated services. Some believe that having multiple private fire departments may lead to competition rather than cooperation, which could negatively impact response times and effectiveness during emergencies. Additionally, critics argue that privatization could potentially lead to favoritism towards those willing to pay more for better service, creating an uneven playing field. Examples mentioned include the privatization of healthcare systems, where hospitals must compete for patients and resources, leading to potential issues in providing quality care for everyone equally.",

      "\ud83c\udfb5outro music plays\ud83c\udfb5 So, a new episode of Jung Naiv. We are in the studio. I have a new guest. Who are you?\n I am Michael Pruetz. What are you doing?\n Well, at the moment I am Michael Pruetz. What are you doing?\n Well, at the moment I am one of the six or seven non-profit speakers who are\n revoking the campaign Deutsche Wohnen & Co.\n Otherwise, in my other life, I am a self-employed insurance broker.\n Okay, but we don't want to talk about your insurance brokerage.\n No, no, of course not.\n But about your initiative.\n Exactly.\n You are a speaker, you are someone like Steffen Seibert, right?\n For your initiative.\n Well, we have six to eight people\n who represent us in the public.\n So they answer press inquiries,\n who appear on television or as with you.\n And of course they also do other things.\n For example, I often talk to customers\n or to tenants in the outside districts.\n I'm a bit responsible for that.\n Tell me briefly what your initiative is about.\n What do you want to achieve?\n We want to expropriate the 12 to 14, exactly no one knows that by now,\n the 12 to 14 private profit-oriented housing associations to\n then to socialize them. That means to\n to recommunalize, one could say, to bring them back into society.\n I emphasized this because there are always rumors about this matter.\n We don't want to, as the CDU claims, to expropriate property owners,\n nor do we want to expropriate small developers, nor do we want to expropriate cooperatives.\n All of this is not planned, but it is repeatedly claimed in political fight against us.\n Now you are at Jung & Naiv. What does expropriation mean?\n Expropriation means that the apartments that you now own, for example the German housing\n stock company, Bonovia Stock Company and others, will be taken away against compensation,\n of course.\n They have to be compensated.\n And we want to found a new housing construction company with these apartments, an\n office of public rights, a common-use housing construction company.\n But of course it has to be dispossessed.\n By the way, we are following the article 15 of the Basic Law,\n where it is explicitly stated to disqualify, to re-associate.\n This is an interesting article, because it has been around since 1949.\n Back then all parties wanted to be left, including the CDU.\n And they wrote the article into the constitution and it has never been applied.\n And we came up with the idea to apply it, of course within the framework of the state of Berlin, not in the federal system.\n Is that also stated in the Berlin constitution?\n In the Berlin constitution there is something different, but the federal constitution is above the Berlin constitution.\n Our opponents claim that the Berlin constitution does not see any disqualification.\n That is also true.\n The new constitution of 1995, but of course it does not violate the constitution.\n That would be something like when we in Berlin...\n You always have to laugh about this argumentation.\n You can't make a public appeal in Berlin\n to file a death penalty.\n Then the basic law would take over and it wouldn't work.\n So the basic law is always overdone.\n Okay, so expulsion means\n someone private is taken away,\n but for that he or she gets money. For that he or she gets money for it.\n They or she gets money for it, exactly.\n What does it mean to socialize? What is the difference between socializing and depriving?\n Well, depriving is first of all taking away. And then something has to happen to the apartments.\n And we want these apartments to return to the Berlin city society.\n That means belonging to the Berliners. That means socializing.\n Have the apartments ever belonged to all of us?\n A large part, of course.\n For example, a large part of the German housing stock, the GSW,\n belonged to the state of Berlin.\n And unfortunately, the red-red Senate in 2004\n has squandered 65,000 say, for a few hundred million.\n And later they also demolished other housing associations.\n And that's the sad part, that the apartments once belonged to the state of Berlin.\n And we now have to work hard to get them back.\n Why did you want that?",
      "Where does it need, in which social areas, no market? Where can't there be a game?\n I think with a lot of interpersonal interactions, I would think it's problematic\n if we think about a market. A market breaks relationships. Let's think. For example, I can remember a colleague who reported\n that they were discussing with his wife on Sundays who would go to the bakery and get the\n rolls. And then they developed a market and he paid her to go to the bakery.\n The marriage didn't last long. So these are classic examples\n where you might not get very far with Marc.\n I thought you were saying police, fire department, justice, health care.\n Ah.\n We privatize the police, Monika. We privatize the fire department. We privatize\n the health care, as we have already done.\n Okay, we have to think about that again. Police...\n You can think about that.\n There is a certain extent of private security services when a company wants to ensure that it has not broken into the business field.\n But they don't have the business grounds. But they don't have state violence. Exactly. That's exactly the point.\n So, private security services for an event,\n for a company or something, there are,\n it makes sense, it works.\n The other thing is,\n if I have the monopoly of violence as a state,\n and I should have it,\n then I have to make sure that it is practiced by people who are obliged to the state.\n And I can't allow that they are then paid by someone else\n to then possibly not enforce the law.\n That's why I have law enforcement officers, that's why I have law enforcement judges,\n because they should be obliged to the state,\n should be loyal to them and to the laws that enforce them and not to the one that offers the most.\n But isn't justice part of the economic privatization?\n There are always these agreements.\n Yes, international agreements, such as the Schiedsgericht.\n Where the lawyers play the judge and the companies or the states, where the lawyers can choose?\n Yes, it is correct that there are such institutions, but it is still not the case that the one who pays the most then prevails.\n This plays a role in court proceedings, maybe we'll talk a little bit about competition later.\n Of course.\n This actually plays a role. Who doesn't now, who is staking the rights? That's not the point.\n But who has more money for lawyers? That's of course a certain role.\n And fire brigade and such?\n But with the judges, in the planned economies,\n which have developed or should develop into democracies,\n into states according to western principles.\n And we see what goes wrong if the judiciary is not independent\n and not committed to the laws.\n Can we privatize the fire department?\n That's a health care system.\n Could you privatize the fire department?\n Sorry.\n The best fire department will get through.\n The best fire department will get through.\n I'm not sure if that will actually bring about efficiency gains. So we should actually talk about why we want to have state-owned companies in some cases\n or want to have state violence in some cases.\n Or state-owned basic care.\n I don't see that we need a competition for the fire department now, that there are many efficiency gains. Well, there are probably, you can do it better or faster, but I don't think a competing fire department would be so good at this point.\n I think that was the idea. In every smaller, larger city there is a fire department and there was also a hospital.\n We have now partly privatized the hospitals.\n They are now also part of a competition and have to earn money and have to make profits.\n We can do that at the fire department too.\n If the fire department in the neighboring city is faster at the fire than the own, then it just sets itself through. Yes, I don't think that's it. So I wouldn't see any reason why you wanted to have that\n and why it should be more efficient now. In hospitals, you have to think about\n why you have partly privatized that now. It's actually about whether it makes sense Is it reasonable that everything is in the hands of the state, what kind of precautions you want to offer?\n And where can it be reasonable that it is in the hands of private companies?\n Do you know anything about that?\n It is not fundamentally wrong to say that there are private hospitals that also try to work efficiently, to work well."
