There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces. Bridges and roads in Khartoum were closed, and the RSF claimed that all roads heading south of Khartoum were closed. The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio.\n\nThe Sudan Civil Aviation Authority closed the country's airspace as fighting began. Telecommunications provider MTN shut down Internet services, and by 23 April there was a near-total Internet outage across Sudan. This was attributed to electricity shortages caused by attacks on the electric grid. Sudanese international trade began to break down, with Maersk, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, announcing a pause on new shipments to the country.\nWith al-Burhan trapped in Khartoum, his deputy Malik Agar became de facto leader of the Sudanese government.\n\nHemedti directed his forces to capture or kill al-Burhan, and RSF units engaged in pitched and bloody combat with the Republican Guard. Ultimately al-Burhan managed to evade capture or assassination, but his base at the Sudanese Armed Forces Headquarters was eventually placed under RSF siege, rendering him unable to leave Khartoum. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Hemedti accused al-Burhan and his commanders of forcing the RSF to start the war by scheming to bring deposed leader Omar al-Bashir back to power. He called for the international community to intervene against al-Burhan, claiming that the RSF was fighting against radical Islamic militants.\n\nFollowing the first few days of war the SAF brought in reinforcements from the Ethiopian border. Although a ceasefire was announced for Eid al-Fitr, fighting continued across the country. Combat was described as particularly intense along the highway from Khartoum to Port Sudan and in the industrial zone of al-Bagair. Intercommunal clashes were reported in Blue Nile State and in Geneina.\n\nBy the beginning of May the SAF claimed to have weakened the RSF's combat capabilities and repelled their advances in multiple regions. The Sudanese police deployed its Central Reserve Forces in the streets of Khartoum in support of the SAF, claiming to have arrested several hundred RSF fighters. The SAF announced it was launching an all-out attack on RSF in Khartoum using air strikes and artillery. Air strikes and ground offensives against the RSF over the next few days caused significant damage to infrastructure, but failed to dislodge RSF forces from their positions.\n\nFollowing further threats to his life from Hemedti, al-Burhan gave a public video address from his besieged base at the Army Headquarters, vowing to continue fighting. On 19 May, al-Burhan officially removed Hemedti as his deputy in the Transitional Sovereignty Council and replaced him with former rebel leader and council member Malik Agar. With al-Burhan trapped in Khartoum, Agar became de facto leader of the Sudanese government, assuming responsibility for peace negotiations, international visits and the day-to-day running of the country.\nTreaty of Jeddah\nMain article: Treaty of Jeddah (2023)\n\nInternational attention to the conflict resulted in the United Nations Human Rights Council calling a special session to address the violence, voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses. On 6 May, delegates from the SAF and the RSF met directly for the first time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for what was described by Saudi Arabia and the United States as \"pre-negotiation talks\". After diplomatic lobbying from the Saudis and Americans the warring sides signed the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May, vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians, protect relief workers, and prohibit the use of civilians as human shields. The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and clashes resumed in Geneina, causing more casualties.", "On 23 April, a French evacuation convoy was shot at, injuring one person. The French government later confirmed the casualty to be a French soldier. An employee of the Egyptian embassy was shot and injured during an evacuation mission.\nNotable deaths\n\nAsia Abdelmajid, an actress, was killed in a crossfire in Khartoum North. A singer, Shaden Gardood, was killed in a crossfire in Omdurman, as was former football player Fozi el-Mardi and his daughter. Araki Abdelrahim, a member of the music group Igd al-Jalad, was killed by the shelling of a mosque in the El-Shajara neighborhood of west Khartoum. The governor of West Darfur, Khamis Abakar, was abducted and killed by armed men hours after accusing the RSF of genocide and calling for international intervention in a TV interview. Ahmed Abkar Barqo Abdel-Rahman, a former member of parliament and a Zaghawa, was killed by the RSF in a raid on his house in Nyala.\nForeign involvement\nEgypt\n\nOn 16 April, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference. According to former CIA analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian special forces units have been deployed and are providing intelligence and tactical support to the SAF. The Wall Street Journal said that Egypt had sent fighter jets and pilots to support the Sudanese military. On 17 April, satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone revealed that one Egyptian Air Force MiG-29M2 fighter jet had been destroyed and two others had been damaged or destroyed at Merowe Airbase. A Sudanese Air Force Guizhou JL-9 was among the destroyed aircraft. After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military prior to the outbreak of hostilities.\nEgyptian POWs\n\nOn 15 April, RSF forces claimed, via Twitter, to have taken Egyptian troops prisoner near Merowe, and a military plane carrying markings of the Egyptian Air Force. Initially, no official explanation was given for the Egyptian soldiers' presence, while Egypt and Sudan have had military cooperation due to diplomatic tensions with Ethiopia. Later on, the Egyptian Armed Forces stated that around 200 of its soldiers were in Sudan to conduct exercises with the Sudanese military. Around that time, the SAF reportedly encircled RSF forces in Merowe airbase. As a result, the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that it was following the situation as a precaution for the safety of its personnel.[better source needed] The RSF later stated that it would cooperate in repatriating the soldiers to Egypt. On 19 April, the RSF stated that it had moved the soldiers to Khartoum and would hand them over when the \"appropriate opportunity\" arose. One hundred and seventy-seven of the captured Egyptian troops were released and flown back to Egypt aboard three Egyptian military planes that took off from Khartoum airport later in the day. The remaining 27 soldiers, who were from the Egyptian Air Force, were sheltered at the Egyptian embassy and later evacuated.\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nA report published by the Wall Street Journal on 10 August quoted Ugandan officials as saying that an Emirati plane on a stopover at Entebbe Airport en route to Amdjarass International Airport in eastern Chad turned out upon inspection to have been carrying dozens of green plastic crates in the plane's cargo hold filled with ammunition, assault rifles and other small arms\", rather than food and other aid officially listed on the aircraft's manifest supposedly meant for Sudanese refugees. Despite the discovery, the plane was allowed to take off, and the officials said they received orders from their superiors not to inspect any more planes from the UAE. Prior to this, the UAE had long been accused of supporting the RSF. The UAE Foreign Ministry subsequently denied the allegations, saying that the country \"does not take sides\" in the conflict.\n\nOfficials from the US, European and African countries claimed that the UAE was running a covert operation to back the RSF. Since June, Emirati cargo planes were identified landing in Amdjarass in Chad, where an airfield and a hospital were being used for the operation. The UAE insisted its operation was purely humanitarian, but officials stated that it involved supplying powerful weapons and drones to the RSF, treating their injured fighters and airlifting serious cases to their military hospital."]}, {"query": "Which militant groups were involved in the attacks in Balochistan, Pakistan, in February 2022, resulting in the death of at least 21 people (9 militants and 12 soldiers) and the injury of several others?", "response": "\n\nAccording to the provided text, the following militant groups were involved in the attacks in Balochistan, Pakistan, in February 2022:\n\n1.

Dost Mohammad Khan Baloch refused to submit, trusting in the network of alliances he had built up over the whole of the province south of the Sar\u1e25add. However, as soon as Re\u017c\u0101 Shah's army under General Am\u012br Amanullah Jahanbani arrived in the area, the alliances dissolved. D\u016bst-Mo\u1e25ammad Khan was left with a relatively small force and few allies of any consequence. The Persian army had little difficulty in defeating him. Once again Baluch political unity proved highly brittle. D\u016bst-Mo\u1e25ammad eventually surrendered and was pardoned on condition he live in Tehran. After a year, he escaped while on a hunting trip. In due course, he was recaptured, and having killed his guard in the escape was hanged for murder. Baloch activists complained that the new governance was centralised and dominated by the Persians, \"forcing the Baloch community and other minorities to fight to protect their rights.\"\n\nBaloch people in Iran have several grievances. The Shi'ite Islamic revolution perceived the predominantly Sunni Baloch as a \"threat\".", "Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\nTotal fatalities by year in the Balochistan insurgency since 2000, including civilians, security forces, terrorists, and insurgents; may not all sum up to total as an \"unspecified\" category also exists\n\nFurthermore, Baloch separatist themselves stand accused of rights abuses. Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a 40-page report which criticised Baloch nationalists of killing, threatening and harassing teachers. Human Right Watch (HRW) has also held separatist responsible for attacks on schools across the province. Another factor which limits the scope of nationalist insurgency is the lack of support from locals as majority of locals don't support separatist groups. Locals support political parties who use legislature to address their grievances.\nHuman rights issues\nMain article: Human rights violations in Balochistan\n\nHuman Right Organisations have held Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) responsible for ethnic cleansing in the province as Brahamdagh Bugti (alleged leader of BLA), during a TV interview on 15 April 2009, urged separatists to kill non-Baloch residing in Balochistan. His actions allegedly lead to the death of 500 non-Baloch citizens in the province. According to The Economist around 800 non-Baloch settlers and Baloch have been killed by Baloch militant groups since 2006. Similarly, Human Right Watch have also held Baloch militants groups like Baloch liberation army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation United Front (BLUF) to be responsible for attacks on schools, teachers and students in the province. As a result, many teachers have sought transfer to secure areas such as Quetta or have moved out of province entirely. Separatist militants groups have also claimed responsibility for attacking and killing Journalists in the province. Apart from Human Right Organisations, Baloch separatists themselves have accused each other of being involved in Human right violations.\n\nIn the period 2003 to 2012, it is estimated that 8000 people were abducted by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan. In 2008 alone, more than 1100 Baloch people disappeared. There have also been reports of torture. An increasing number of bodies \"with burn marks, broken limbs, nails pulled out, and sometimes with holes drilled in their heads\" are being found on roadsides as the result of a \"kill and dump\" campaign allegedly conducted by Pakistani security forces, particularly Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Frontier Corps (FC). A 2013 report from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan identified ISI and Frontier Corps as the perpetrators for many disappearances, while noting a more cooperative stance from these agencies in recent years as perceived by local police forces. The Pakistan Rangers are also alleged to have committed a vast number of human rights violations in the region. No one has been held responsible for the crimes. However, Pakistani security officials have rejected all the allegations made against them. Major General Obaid Ullah Khan claim that Baloch militants are using Frontier Corps (FC) uniform to kidnap people and malign the good name of Frontier Corps. Baloch militants have also been found using military uniform which resembles the one used by Frontier Corps while carrying out their activities. A senior Pakistani provincial security official claims that missing person figures are 'exaggerated', that 'in Balochistan, insurgents, immigrants who fled to Europe and even those who have been killed in military operations are declared as missing persons'. Reports have shown that many people have fled the province to seek asylum in other countries because of the unrest caused by separatist militants.\n\nMilitant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi have systematically targeted Shia Muslims in Balochistan, with about 600 being killed in attacks in recent years.\n\nDuring a camp at Broken Chair, Geneva, Baloch Republican Party (BRP) leader Sher Baz Bugti alleged that Baloch youth, women and children were kept in \"torture cells\". BRP chief Brahumdagh Bugti called upon human rights organisation, including the United Nations, to take steps to stop the alleged \"Baloch genocide\".\nSunni extremism and religious persecution of Zikris\n\nThe activities of terrorist organisations such as Lashkar-i-Jhangvi and Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, have produced a surge in religious extremism in Balochistan. Hindus, Shias (including Hazaras) and Zikris have been targeted, resulting in the migration of over 300,000 of them from Baluchistan.\n\nBaloch Liberation Front (BLF) and Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) have also targeted Zikris in the province."]}, {"query": "Which Sudanese political groupings called for the formation of a caretaker government in July 2022, following a meeting in Cairo, to rule the country during the ongoing conflict and promote dialogue?", "response": "Four Sudanese political groupings, namely the Forces for Freedom and Change, the National Movement Forces, the National Accord Forces, and the National Forces Alliance, called for the formation of a caretaker government in July 2022, following a meeting in Cairo, to rule the country during the ongoing conflict and promote dialogue.", "contexts": ["On 22 and 23 April, protests against the conflict were held by residents in Khartoum Bahri, Arbaji, and Damazin.

Several of Sudan's neighbors, including Chad, Egypt and South Sudan closed their border with Sudan, while Eritrea said it would not establish refugee camps for those crossing its border from Sudan.\n\nInternational organizations also echoed demands for an end to the fighting and the restoration of civilian government.", "Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the Darfur Peace Agreement, with some factions joining the government in Khartoum. By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour. The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur had refused to sign and kept fighting.\n\nThe SPLM-N was founded by units of the predominantly South Sudanese Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army stationed in areas that remained in Sudan following the South Sudanese vote for independence in 2011. These forces then led a rebellion in the southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile a few months later. In 2017, the SPLM-N split between a faction led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and one led by Malik Agar, with al-Hilu demanding secularism as a condition for peace while Agar did not agree with this. During the Sudanese Revolution, al-Hilu's faction declared an indefinite unilateral ceasefire. In 2020, a peace agreement was signed between the Sudanese government and Agar's faction, with Agar later joining the Transitional Sovereignty Council in Khartoum. Al-Hilu held out until he agreed to sign a separate peace agreement with the Sudanese government a few months after. Further steps to consolidate the agreement stalled following the 2021 coup, and the al-Hilu faction instead signed an agreement with the SLM-al-Nur and the Sudanese Communist Party, agreeing to co-operate in order to draft a 'revolutionary charter' and remove the military from power.\nPrelude\n\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak Sudanese economy steeply declined, fuelling wide protests demanding that the junta relinquish power back to civilian authorities. Tensions soon arose between the two junta leaders over al-Burhan's restoration to office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government. Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics. This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab. As a sign of the growing rift between him and al-Burhan, Hemedti expressed regret over the October 2021 coup.\n\nTensions between the RSF and the SAF began to escalate in February 2023, as the RSF began to recruit members from across Sudan. Throughout February and early March there was a military build up in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, however a deal was brokered on 11 March, with the RSF withdrawing its forces from the capital. As part of this deal negotiations were conducted between the SAF, RSF and civilian leaders, but these were delayed and halted by political disagreements. Chief among the disputes was the integration of the RSF into the military: The RSF insisted on a 10-year timetable for its integration into the regular army, while the army demanded integration within two years. Other contested issues included the status given to RSF officers in the future hierarchy, and whether RSF forces should be under the command of the army chief rather than Sudan's commander-in-chief, who is al-Burhan.\n\nOn 11 April 2023, RSF forces were deployed near the city of Merowe as well as in Khartoum. Government forces ordered them to leave, and they refused. This led to clashes when RSF forces took control of the Soba military base south of Khartoum. On 13 April, RSF forces began their mobilization, raising fears of a potential rebellion against the junta. The SAF declared the mobilization illegal.\nCourse of the war\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the War in Sudan (2023\u2013present).\nSee also: List of engagements during the war in Sudan (2023)\nApril\u2013May\nBattle of Khartoum\nMain article: Battle of Khartoum (2023-present)\n\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport.

The Dash 8 was fitted with a Mode S-capable transponder but was reportedly not equipped with ADS-B; this meant the aircraft's position and speed were not reported by the aircraft itself and instead relied on multilateration by on-ground receivers.\nCollision\nAirport layout with the location of the runway collision and the wreckage of both aircraft.\nCoast Guard plane\n\nThe Japan Coast Guard aircraft, carrying six crew members, was preparing to bring supplies to an airbase in Niigata in response to the 2024 Noto earthquake, which had occurred the day before. It was one of four aircraft deployed by the government to provide help to the affected areas.\n\nThe aircraft was reported to be stationary on the runway for around 40 seconds before the collision. The captain reported that the back of the aircraft suddenly caught fire shortly after he had increased the engine power before exploding following the collision.

According to the Tokyo Fire Department, the fire was largely extinguished shortly after midnight, by which time the plane's structure had collapsed due to the intensity of the flames. The collision and subsequent fire were captured by CCTV cameras in Terminal 2. After the collision, the ADS-B signals, except for position information, from the aircraft were received for about one minute. Firefighters later said that the fire spread from the vicinity of the plane's left engine."]}, {"query": "Which international organization issued an order on 26 January 2024, ordering Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts that could be considered genocidal in relation to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire?", "response": "The International Court of Justice issued the order on 26 January 2024.", "contexts": ["On 29 December, South Africa submitted a case to the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza and requested provisional measures for Israel to suspend its military campaign in Gaza. In its filing, South Africa alleged that Israel's actions were \"intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.\" On 2 January 2024, Israel decided to appear before the ICJ in response to the case made by South Africa. The Court issued an Order in relation to the provisional measures request on 26 January 2024 in which it ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts that could be considered genocidal but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. It determined that it was \"plausible\" that some of Israel's actions may violate the Genocide Convention. The final ruling is expected to take years.\nSiege of Gaza\nSee also: Siege of Gaza City and Urban warfare\nIsraeli soldiers operating in a ruined Gazan neighborhood\n\nIsrael imposed a \"complete siege\" on Gaza in the first ten days of the war, due to security concerns that weapons, fuel and armaments would be transferred to Hamas in the guise of humanitarian aid. Israel later allowed the delivery of limited humanitarian aid following security checks. Israel's restriction of the flow of food, fuel, water and other humanitarian aid was criticized as a war crime by human rights organizations.\n\nTom Dannenbaum, co-director of the Center for International Law & Governance at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, wrote that the order \"commands the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime.\" Oxfam issued a statement that accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war, saying \"International Humanitarian Law (IHL) strictly prohibits the use of starvation as a method of warfare and as the occupying power in Gaza, Israel is bound by IHL obligations to provide for the needs and protection of the population of Gaza\".\n\nGeoffrey S. Corn, Chair of Criminal Law and Director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, and Sean Watts, professor in the Department of Law at the United States Military Academy at West Point, write that sieges are subject to the same laws of war as other military tactics such as distinction and proportionality. Watts previously wrote that Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention \"requires that parties to a conflict allow passage of a limited class of relief supplies for civilians...only if the parties are satisfied no advantage will result 'to the military efforts or economy of the enemy'\", but that if the law is interpreted to allow \"incidental\" starvation of civilians proportional to anticipated military advantage, it \"reduces the rule's humanitarian effect, perhaps to the vanishing point.\"\n\nAmnesty International called for an urgent investigation into Israel's mass detentions and the enforced disappearance of Palestinians in Gaza, noting that the disappearances and treatment of captives could amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity.\nProportionality and distinction\n\nIt has been debated whether Israel is respecting the principles of discrimination and proportionality as required under the laws of war. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has stated that the overall civilian death toll, and Israel's use of powerful weapons in Gaza's densely-populated neighbourhoods, raised \"serious questions\" about the legality of Israel's conduct. HRW further argued that a higher proportion of casualties among women and children is indicative of a lack of proportionality, demonstrating what they describe as \"a disregard toward Palestinian lives\". United Nations officials and human rights groups have argued that Israel has not done enough to protect civilians.\n\nEmanuela-Chiara Gillard, an associate fellow at Chatham House, argued that, given the size and nature of the 7 October attacks, Israel has a right of self-defence that could include its stated military aim of destroying Hamas, which has threatened to repeat its assault and eradicate the state of Israel. According to The Economist, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and international humanitarian law (IHL) grant Israel flexibility when it comes to taking military action against Hamas, but in its view, Israel's \"definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point.\"\n\nAmichai Cohen, an Israeli lawyer, alleges that Israel does not deliberately target civilians but that Hamas's tactics make it hard to take action without affecting civilians. Jill Goldenziel, a professor at the United States National Defense University and Marine Corps University, states that if Israel conducted every strike legally and with utmost precision, civilian casualties in war would still remain, and the goal of a proportionality analysis is to decide whether they are excessive. Israeli security officials state that their proportionality criteria in this conflict are unchanged and that they receive legal advice in relation to strikes.", "In remarks to the Security Council, UN Secretary-General Guterres expressed deep concern at \"clear violations of international humanitarian law\" in Gaza and also said, \"It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation\", leading the Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan to call for Guterres's resignation. Following this, Guterres said that he was \"shocked by the misrepresentations\" of his statement, pointing out he had also said \"... the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas.\"\n\nOn 12 December, the UN General Assembly voted to demand \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\".

South Korea condemned Hamas and called Hamas's attack \"indiscriminate\"; expressed worries that despite missile interceptor defense systems it would remain vulnerable if North Korea attempted a similar attack on South Korea. Most Latin American governments condemned Hamas's attacks in Israel, while some, such as Colombia, expressed solidarity with Palestinians. The European Union announced it would review aid to Palestinian authorities to ensure the aid was not funding terrorism, and subsequently announced that immediate humanitarian aid to Gaza would be tripled.\n\nAustria, Germany, and Sweden suspended development aid to Palestine in response to Hamas's attack and said that they would review other projects and aid given. Germany sent two Heron TP drones to Israel. On 8 November 2023, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs announced that the German government had authorized a tenfold increase in arms exports to Israel; the export of military equipment to Israel would be treated and approved as a priority. Exports worth around 32 million euros in all of 2022 rose to almost 303 million euros in 2023, most of which was authorized after the start of the war. Heads of the World Uyghur Congress and the Uyghur Human Rights Project condemned Hamas while East Turkistan Government-in-Exile minister Salih Hudayar declared support for Israel. Croatia's president Zoran Milanovi\u0107 publicly stated that Israel had lost his sympathy due to its humanitarian crimes and \"reprisal actions\" in Gaza. Colombian president Gustavo Petro likened IDF attacks against Palestinians to Nazis and asked the Israeli ambassador to \"apologize and leave the country\". Spain's deputy prime minister Yolanda D\u00edaz called on the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop what she called a massacre in Gaza. On multiple occasions, Pope Francis referred to Israel's actions in Gaza as \"terror\" and \"terrorism\".\n\nResponses from African governments varied, showing division about the source of the conflict and who is to blame.

On the same day, China said Palestinians had been forced to move south because of Israel's evacuation order \"only to suffer from air strikes in the south as well\" and called the hospital explosion a \"heinous attack\" while Russia labeled the explosion as a war crime, saying that the US was ultimately responsible.\n\nOn 31 October, Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Israel due to what the deputy foreign minister called \"the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive\".

Jordan's Foreign Minister cited an \"unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe\" and condemned the \"Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza\". Bahrain's National Assembly additionally cut off all economic relations, citing a \"solid and historical stance that supports the Palestinian cause and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\" This decision does not appear to have been implemented. Honduras' Minister of Foreign Affairs cited Israel's violations of international humanitarian law.

Belize suspended diplomatic relations with Israel, citing the \"unceasing, indiscriminate bombing in Gaza\" and its violations of international humanitarian law.\nWillingness to take refugees by third countries\n\nBoth Jordan and Egypt have rejected the idea of hosting Palestinian refugees fleeing from Gaza, with King Abdullah II of Jordan warning against pushing Palestinians to seek refuge in Jordan, and emphasizing the need to address the humanitarian situation within Gaza and the West Bank. Both countries have expressed serious concern that Israel may seek to permanently expel Palestinians, a statement that Israel disputes. On 2 November, however, Egypt said it will help around 7,000 foreigners and Palestinians with dual-nationalities through the Rafah Border Crossing.\n\nScotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf who has family in Gaza, urged the international community to establish a refugee program for those fleeing violence in Gaza and said that Scotland was ready to offer sanctuary to refugees arriving in the UK. European countries are wary of a refugee influx due to recent pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nIn the United States, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested that the problem of refugees be solved by \"the region's partners\", but emphasized the \"historical role\" of the US in accepting refugees, while Representative Jamaal Bowman said that the US should welcome refugees who are not affiliated with Hamas. Both former president Donald Trump and Florida governor Ron DeSantis voiced their opposition to accepting any Palestinian refugees.\nReactions\n\nThis section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably.

Israeli authorities said that the airstrikes are intended to degrade the military infrastructure that is frequently constructed in close proximity to residential areas and civilian establishments. They also denounced the \"deliberate and widespread killing and hostage-taking of innocent civilians\" by Hamas, calling them \"heinous violations of international law and international crimes\". Israel's forced evacuation of northern Gaza also drew international condemnation. On 13 October, Paula Gaviria Betancur, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, called it a \"crime against humanity\". On 14 October, Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, characterized it as a \"repeat of the 1948 Nakba\", noting Israeli public officials' open advocacy for another Nakba. On 16 November, UN experts reported that \"grave violations\" committed by Israeli forces against the Palestinians of Gaza \"point to a genocide in the making\" and called on the international community to prevent this unfolding genocide.

The Church of Saint Porphyrius, the third oldest church in the world, was damaged in an airstrike, as has the Saint Hilarion Monastery. The Byzantine Church of Jabalia [ar], dating from the 5th century and restored in 2022, was destroyed. The destruction of Gaza City's public library and central archives have been compared to the 1992 attacks on the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Evacuees described the evacuation path as full of death and horror. Jan Egeland, the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said on 5 December that \"The pulverising of Gaza now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age. Each day we see more dead children and new depths of suffering for the innocent people enduring this hell\".\n\nOn 12 December, the UN General Assembly once again voted overwhelmingly for a resolution on immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza and aid access. The resolution attracted 153 votes in favor and 23 abstentions; 10 countries voted against, namely Israel, the United States, Austria, the Czech Republic, Guatemala, Liberia, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea and Paraguay.\n\nDue to an agreement reportedly brokered by Qatar and France between Israel and Hamas, medicine was scheduled to leave Doha via two military aircraft and be delivered to the Gaza Strip on 17 January 2024 to aid hostages. The medicine was successfully delivered.\nAllegations of war crimes\nMain article: War crimes in the Israel\u2013Hamas war\nSee also: Israel\u2013Hamas war hostage crisis\n\nBoth Hamas and the IDF have been accused of attempted or imminent genocide, and several other war crimes, based on their actions in the war.\n\nThe International Criminal Court issued a statement on 10 October confirming that its mandate to investigate alleged war crimes committed since June 2014 in the State of Palestine extends to the current conflict. ICC prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan visited the Rafah crossing and said \"the ICC is independently looking at the situation in Palestine,\" including \"events in Israel and allegations that Palestinian nationals have also committed crime.\" The UN Human Rights Council said it had \"clear evidence\" of war crimes by both sides. The Permanent United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Israel Palestine conflict said there is \"clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable.\"\n2023 Hamas attack on Israel\nGenocide accusations\nMain articles: Allegations of genocide in the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel\n\nSeveral experts in international law and genocide studies characterized Hamas's assault as genocide. Legal and genocide experts have condemned the attack, during which 1,139 people were killed, including 695 Israeli civilians. They argue that these actions by Hamas constitute a significant violation of international law and were carried out with the intent to destroy the Israeli national group. Some commentators highlight Hamas's founding charter, which calls for the destruction of Israel; this has led to suggestions that its intent is genocidal and that the attacks on 7 October were an attempt to fulfill this agenda.\n\nIn a 12 October preliminary legal assessment condemning Hamas's attacks in Israel, international humanitarian law scholar and Dean of Cornell Law School Jens David Ohlin said the evidence suggested Hamas's \"killings and kidnappings\" potentially violated Articles 6\u20138 of the Rome Statute as well as the Genocide Convention and were \"crimes against humanity\"; over a hundred international scholars expressed support for this position.\nSexual and gender-based violence\nMain article: Sexual and gender-based violence in the 7 October attack on Israel\n\nDuring the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities, Israeli women and girls were reportedly raped, assaulted, and mutilated by Hamas militants, an allegation that Hamas denies. In the months following the attacks, The Wall Street Journal reported on 21 December, there was \"mounting evidence of sexual violence, based on survivor accounts, first responders and witnesses.\" A two-month New York Times investigation, released in late December 2023, found at least seven locations where sexual assaults and mutilations of Israeli women and girls were carried out. It concluded that these were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence during the 7 October massacres. The probe was based on video footage, photographs, GPS data from mobile phones and interviews with more than 150 people. The newspaper's probe concluded that Hamas \"weaponized sexual violence\" during the attacks. Israeli police said dozens of women and some men were raped. The New York Times reported that \"videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers.\"\n\nThese acts were denounced as gender-based violence, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, aligning with the International Criminal Court's recognition of sexual violence as such."]}, {"query": "Which geological formation in Iceland, approximately 2 km north of Grindav\u00edk, has shown signs of magma close to the surface since November 2023, leading to increased risks of an eruption, and where was the largest ground displacement recorded during the evacuation of Grindav\u00edk on 10 November?", "response": "\nSundhn\u00fakur crater chain north of Grindav\u00edk, Iceland.\nThe largest ground displacement recorded during the evacuation of Grindav\u00edk was approximately 20 cm (0.66 ft) south of the Sundhn\u00fakur crater chain.", "contexts": ["The 2023\u20132024 Sundhn\u00fakur eruptions are an ongoing series of volcanic eruptions in the Reykjanes peninsula, near the town of Grindav\u00edk, Iceland.

The intensity of the eruption and accompanying seismic activity decreased early on 19 December 2023, with lava seen spreading laterally from both sides of the newly opened fissures. The eruption was described as the largest in the Reykjanes Peninsula since the beginning of eruptive activity in 2021, with lava fountains, up to 100 metres (330 ft) high, and was visible as far away as the capital Reykjav\u00edk, 42 kilometres (26 mi) away.

Seven intrusions have occurred in the Eldv\u00f6rp-Svartsengi volcanic system since December 2019, with the latest two contributing to the current eruption series. Prior intrusions did not result in an eruption. Volcanic unrest on the peninsula during this period had mostly been associated with the Fagradalsfjall system, where three out of four confirmed magmatic intrusions culminated in volcanic eruptions.\n\nAlthough earthquakes are a frequent occurrence in Iceland due to the island's location, straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, the recent swarm was noted for being more extensive than usual. A total of five identified volcanic eruptions have occurred in the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021.", "Officials said residents of Grindav\u00edk would be allowed back into the town.\n\nThe IMO said the eruption occurred at around 22:17 UTC following a series of small earthquakes at around 21:00. It pinpointed the origin of the eruption near Hagafell, about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) north-east of Grindav\u00edk, and noted that the eruption stemmed from a fissure with a length of about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi), with lava flowing at a rate of around 100 to 200 cubic metres per second adding that seismic activity appeared to be moving towards the direction of Grindav\u00edk. An Icelandic Civil Defence official told the public broadcaster R\u00daV that the eruption had happened quickly and appeared to be \"quite a large event\".\nJanuary 2024 eruption\nAerial photograph of the eruption on 14 January.\n\nOn 14 January 2024 around 7:57 UTC, a second eruption began around 400\u2013500 metres (1,300\u20131,600 ft) north of Grindav\u00edk following seismic activity that began from the Sundhn\u00faksg\u00edgar crater. Fissures were reported to have opened up on both sides of the anti-lava defences, and it was estimated that lava would reach the town within 24 hours. A successful mission was launched to save several pieces of heavy machinery used to construct the barriers. The lava cut off one of the main roads leading into Grindav\u00edk. The initial fissure reached a length of up to 900 metres (3,000 ft).\n\nAround noon, another fissure, measuring about 100 metres (330 ft), opened only metres from the outermost houses of the town and subsequently set three houses on fire before ceasing after a few hours. Evacuation orders were reimplemented in Grindav\u00edk, while the Icelandic Coast Guard deployed a helicopter to monitor the situation. Volcanic activity was seen to have \u201cdecreased considerably\u201d by 15 January.\n\nEvgenia Ilyinskaya, a volcanologist from the University of Leeds, told the BBC that the eruption suggested that the Reykjanes peninsula was likely entering a long-term period of frequent eruptions that could last for centuries, which she termed the New Reykjanes Fires after a previous occurrence in the 12th century.\n\nPrior to the eruption, on 10 January, a worker fell into a deep crevice in Grindav\u00edk while working to repair it.

February 2024\n\nOn 8 February 2024 at 6:03 UTC the third eruption started north of S\u00fdlingarfell following intensive seismic activity that began 30 minutes prior. The eruption produced lava fountains with a height measuring between 50 to 80 metres in height and a three-kilometer high volcanic plume. A three-kilometer long fissure opened in the same area as the December eruption, between the Sundhn\u00fakur craters and the hill of St\u00f3ra-Sk\u00f3gfell. The lava was reported to be flowing east and west at a safe distance from Grindav\u00edk, but caused damage to critical infrastructure around the Svartsengi power station. Unlike in the previous eruptions on the peninsula, the 8 February eruption produced quantities of black ash mixed with steam. This is theorised to be the result of groundwater boiling and mixing with magma to create ash.\nImpact\nClosure of the road to Grindav\u00edk\nGrindav\u00edk\n\nFollowing the 5.2 tremor on 10 November, a state of emergency was declared, and evacuation plans were put into effect for Grindav\u00edk. This culminated in the relocation of nearly 4,000 residents, nearly 1 percent of Iceland's entire population. The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management deployed the Icelandic Coast Guard Vessel \u00de\u00f3r to the area \"for safety purposes\". It also closed all roads to Grindav\u00edk except for emergency and evacuation purposes. On 13 November, authorities allowed residents to return briefly to the town to retrieve their belongings. Boat owners were also allowed to remove their vessels from the harbour. The Icelandic government is seeking to accommodate displaced residents in holiday homes and little-used properties while the emergency continues.

It stated that Israel's judiciary, mainly its Supreme Court, has regularly upheld policies, practices and laws that helped enforce \"Israel's system of apartheid against Palestinians\". The article named examples of the role the Supreme Court played against Palestinians: upholding administrative detentions, green-lighting the destruction of villages, upholding a law imposing restrictions on family reunification.

Many of the court's rulings, particularly those limiting the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, as well as those affecting ultra-Orthodox autonomy and way of life have sparked resentment among ultra-Orthodox and Religious Zionist politicians, many of whom have accused the court of engaging in judicial activism in favor of left-wing causes.\n1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\nFurther information: Basic Laws of Israel \u00a7 The Constitutional Revolution of 1992\u20131995\n[icon]\t\nThis section needs expansion.

(March 2023)\n\nBetween 1992 and 1999, Supreme Court Justice Aharon Barak developed a doctrine in a series of rulings, the guiding principle of which is the introduction of human rights indirectly to private law. This is done with the help of concepts such as \"good faith\", \"public policy\" or \"violation of legal duty\" that the judges apply in their rulings. The proponents of judicial reform claim that the problem is that the concepts depend on the judge who interprets them, resulting in legal uncertainty, opening private and government action to judicial review according to the dictates of the judge's conscience and not necessarily according to the laws established by the legislature.\n2018\u20132022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n\nWithin the context of the 2018\u20132022 Israeli political crisis, the 2022 legislative election was the fifth Knesset election in nearly four years, as no party had been able to form a stable coalition government since 2019. In the election, the right-wing bloc won a majority of seats in the Knesset, with far-right elements such as the Religious Zionist Party making record-breaking gains.\n\nFollowing the election, Likud leader and former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed the thirty-seventh government of Israel, assigning many powerful positions in the new government to previously marginalized far-right politicians who had long advocated policies that conflicted with many of the supreme court's precedents and have sought to curtail its powers.

The 29,000 munitions -shells and bombs- Israel has dropped on Gaza in 3 months greatly exceed those (3,678) dropped by the United States between 2004 and 2010 during its Invasion of Iraq. Nearly 70% of homes in Gaza and roughly half of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. As of January 2024, Israel's offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70\u201380% of all buildings in northern Gaza. The damage to buildings in northern Gaza reportedly exceeds that in Bakhmut and Mariupol in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Aleppo in the Battle of Aleppo, and Mosul and Raqqa in the War against the Islamic State; by 5 December 2023, the percentage of buildings damaged or destroyed in Gaza exceeded Dresden and Cologne during World War II and approached the level of destruction seen in Hamburg.

On 21 October, a joint statement by UNICEF, WHO, UNDP, UNFPA, and WFP stated, \"the world must do more\" for Gaza. On 26 October, the World Health Organization stated Gaza's humanitarian and health crisis had \"reached catastrophic proportions\". On 28 October, the Red Cross president Mirjana Spoljaric Egger stated she was \"shocked by the intolerable level of human suffering\". During the course of the first month of the war, the Gaza Ministry of Health recorded more than 4,000 children killed in Gaza. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on 6 November that Gaza is \"fast becoming a graveyard for children\". Israeli UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan responded directly to Guterres, stating \"Shame on [Guterres]... More than 30 minors \u2013 among them a 9-month-old baby as well as toddlers and children who witnessed their parents being murdered in cold blood \u2013 are being held against their will in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is the problem in Gaza, not Israel's actions to eliminate this terrorist organization.\" On 8 November, UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk described the Rafah Crossing as \"gates to a living nightmare\". On 10 November, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Jens Laerke stated, \"if there is a hell on earth, it is the north of Gaza.\"\n\nRetired Israeli major general Giora Eiland compared Israel's situation to that of the United States after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. He argued that if Israel wanted to disarm Hamas, it had \"no choice\" but to make Gaza a place \"that is temporarily or permanently impossible to live in\". This, he stated, was not a \"program for revenge\", but a way to get the hostages back.\n\nOn 18 October, the United States UN representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield vetoed a UN Security Council resolution urging humanitarian aid to Gaza. On 27 October, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly for a resolution on immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza and aid access.

By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour. The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur had refused to sign and kept fighting.\n\nThe SPLM-N was founded by units of the predominantly South Sudanese Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army stationed in areas that remained in Sudan following the South Sudanese vote for independence in 2011. These forces then led a rebellion in the southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile a few months later. In 2017, the SPLM-N split between a faction led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and one led by Malik Agar, with al-Hilu demanding secularism as a condition for peace while Agar did not agree with this. During the Sudanese Revolution, al-Hilu's faction declared an indefinite unilateral ceasefire. In 2020, a peace agreement was signed between the Sudanese government and Agar's faction, with Agar later joining the Transitional Sovereignty Council in Khartoum. Al-Hilu held out until he agreed to sign a separate peace agreement with the Sudanese government a few months after. Further steps to consolidate the agreement stalled following the 2021 coup, and the al-Hilu faction instead signed an agreement with the SLM-al-Nur and the Sudanese Communist Party, agreeing to co-operate in order to draft a 'revolutionary charter' and remove the military from power.\nPrelude\n\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak Sudanese economy steeply declined, fuelling wide protests demanding that the junta relinquish power back to civilian authorities. Tensions soon arose between the two junta leaders over al-Burhan's restoration to office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government. Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics. This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab. As a sign of the growing rift between him and al-Burhan, Hemedti expressed regret over the October 2021 coup.\n\nTensions between the RSF and the SAF began to escalate in February 2023, as the RSF began to recruit members from across Sudan. Throughout February and early March there was a military build up in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, however a deal was brokered on 11 March, with the RSF withdrawing its forces from the capital. As part of this deal negotiations were conducted between the SAF, RSF and civilian leaders, but these were delayed and halted by political disagreements. Chief among the disputes was the integration of the RSF into the military: The RSF insisted on a 10-year timetable for its integration into the regular army, while the army demanded integration within two years. Other contested issues included the status given to RSF officers in the future hierarchy, and whether RSF forces should be under the command of the army chief rather than Sudan's commander-in-chief, who is al-Burhan.\n\nOn 11 April 2023, RSF forces were deployed near the city of Merowe as well as in Khartoum. Government forces ordered them to leave, and they refused. This led to clashes when RSF forces took control of the Soba military base south of Khartoum. On 13 April, RSF forces began their mobilization, raising fears of a potential rebellion against the junta. The SAF declared the mobilization illegal.\nCourse of the war\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the War in Sudan (2023\u2013present).\nSee also: List of engagements during the war in Sudan (2023)\nApril\u2013May\nBattle of Khartoum\nMain article: Battle of Khartoum (2023-present)\n\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport.

On 30 July, different groups in Kadugli organized marches against the violence in South Kordofan, some of whom supported the SAF, while others condemned the SAF, the RSF and the SPLM-N (al-Hilu).\n\nOn 25 July, following a meeting in Cairo, four Sudanese political groupings, namely the Forces for Freedom and Change, the National Movement Forces, the National Accord Forces, and the National Forces Alliance, called on al-Burhan to form \"a caretaker government\" as soon as possible to rule the country during the war and promote dialogue.\n\nOn 30 July, nurses of the Port Sudan Teaching Hospital Emergency Department went on strike in protest over the non-payment of salaries since the beginning of the conflict, forcing the closure of the hospital since then after other departments joined.\n\nIn response to calls by SPLM-N faction leader and Transitional Sovereignty Council Deputy Chair Malik Agar to support the SAF, the Sudanese Communist Party called on upon \"the tribes and people of Sudan to resist calls for recruiting their youth to favour either of the warring parties\" in a statement released on 6 August. Other political groups such as the Forces for Freedom and Change-Central Council and the Sudan Revolutionary Front also expressed their rejection of the conflict and said on 7 August that they had positioned themselves \"equidistant\" from both the SAF and the RSF.\nInternational\nWhite flag memorial at Cornell University for lives lost in the conflicts in Sudan, Congo, and Palestine.\n\nOn 19 April, diplomatic missions in Sudan, which included those of Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Sweden), issued a joint statement calling for fighting parties to observe their obligations under international law, specifically urging them to \"protect civilians, diplomats and humanitarian actors,\" avoid further escalations and initiate talks to \"resolve outstanding issues\".\n\nMany countries condemned the violence and called on the warring sides to cease fighting and resume the democratic transition, while Egypt, South Sudan and Israel offered to mediate between the SAF and the RSF.

The city's fall allowed the RSF to capture most of Gezira and to make inroads in White Nile State, capturing the town of El Geteina. Within a few days RSF fighters had advanced to within 25 km of Sennar, the largest city in Sennar State.

Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December. However, a day before the meeting was due, the Sudanese foreign ministry claimed that they had been contacted by IGAD informing them that the meeting was postponed citing 'technical issues'.\n\nInstead the RSF leader went on a diplomatic tour, travelling on a chartered Emirati jet and meeting with several African national leaders. One visit that was particularly promoted was his visit to Rwanda, where he met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, visited the Kigali Genocide Memorial and spoke of Rwanda's recovery from the Rwandan genocide as a model for Sudan to follow. On the tour Hemedti also met with former Prime Minister Hamdok and his Taqaddum organisation in Addis Ababa, with the RSF agreeing in a declaration negotiated with the Taqaddum to release political prisoners, open up humanitarian aid corridors and negotiate further with the SAF. This tour was regarded by observers as an attempt by Hemedti to portray himself as the leader of Sudan and improve his international image, as his reputation had been severely damaged since the fall of Wad Madani due to large-scale looting by RSF fighters.\n\nOn 5 January, al-Burhan vowed to continue the war against the RSF and rejected the latest peace efforts saying \"No reconciliation\", citing the RSF \"committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in West Darfur and the rest of Sudan.\"\n\nOn 14 January, both Hemedti and Burhan received official invitations from IGAD to attend its upcoming summit on 18 January. Hemedti took to social media to confirm his attendance and show commitment for peace, while Sudan's military junta issued a statement refusing to attend the summit citing that IGAD did not give sufficient reason to why the summit on 28 December was delayed. On 16 January Sudan suspended its contacts with IGAD accusing IGAD of violating Sudan's sovereignty, setting a dangerous precedent and giving the RSF legitimacy by inviting it to a meeting that will be attended by member heads of state and government.

The Guardian reported that the scale of destruction has led international legal experts to raise the concept of domicide, which it describes as \"the mass destruction of dwellings to make  territory uninhabitable.\" By 30 January 2024, satellite image analysis found Israel had destroyed 50-61% of the buildings in Gaza since the start of the war.\n\nDefinitively assessing the extent of destruction in Gaza has been complicated by difficulties in accessing up-to-date satellite imagery. An analysis by The Washington Post found \"apparent craters within 180 meters of 17 of the 28 hospitals in northern Gaza\", although this represents \"a conservative undercount of the actual bombs dropped near Gaza's hospitals\". This analysis focused on bombs weighing 2,000 pounds or more, which could irreparably damage a building 180 meters away."]}, {"query": "Which entities or individuals were sanctioned by the United States government in September 2023 for their involvement in human rights violations during the conflict in Sudan?", "response": "\nAccording to the provided text, the United States government sanctioned the following entities or individuals in September 2023 for their involvement in human rights violations during the conflict in Sudan:\n\n1.

Among some countries with a number of expatriates in Sudan are Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in the country, and the United States, which has more than 16,000 citizens, most of whom are dual nationals. Efforts at extraction were hampered by the fighting within the capital Khartoum, particularly in and around the airport. This has forced evacuations to be undertaken by road via Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which lies about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of Khartoum. from where they were airlifted or ferried directly to their home countries or to third ones. Other evacuations were undertaken through overland border crossings or airlifts from diplomatic missions and other designated locations with direct involvement of the militaries of some home countries. Some transit hubs used during the evacuation include the port of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, which hosts military bases of the United States, China, Japan, France, and other European countries.\nSanctions\n\nUnited States\n\nThe repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S. President Joe Biden issuing an executive order on 4 May 2023 authorizing sanctions for those deemed responsible for destabilizing Sudan, undermining the democratic transition and committing human rights abuses. On 1 June, the US government imposed its first sanctions related to the conflict, targeting two firms associated with the SAF and two others linked to the RSF. It also imposed visa restrictions against individuals involved in the violence, but did not divulge any names.\n\nOn 6 September, the US State Department and the US Treasury imposed sanctions on the RSF's deputy commander and Hemedti's brother Abdelrahim Dagalo, and Abdel Rahman Jumma, the RSF's top commander in West Darfur, over \"extensive\" human rights violations during the conflict, with Jumma in particular being accused of masterminding the assassination of the state's governor Khamis Abakar in June. On 28 September, it sanctioned former foreign minister and leader of the Sudanese Islamic Movement Ali Karti, the Sudan-based GSK Advance Company Ltd, and the Russia-based military company Aviatrade LLC, accusing Karti and other Islamist hardliners of obstructing efforts towards a ceasefire and accusing the firms of supporting the RSF.\n\nOn 4 December, the State Department imposed sanctions on three former officials of the Bashir regime, namely former minister and presidential aide Taha Osman Ahmed al-Hussein and former directors of the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Services Salah Abdallah Mohamed Salah aka Sala Gosh and Mohamed Etta Elmoula Abbas, citing Al-Hussein's involvement in coordinating with regional actors to support the RSF, Gosh's plotting to overthrow the civilian-led transitional government, and Elmoula's attempts to restore the Bashir regime to power.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nOn 12 July, the United Kingdom announced sanctions on firms linked to the SAF and the RSF for providing funds and weapons in the conflict.\nHumanitarian impact\nMain article: Humanitarian impact of the war in Sudan (2023)\n\nThe humanitarian crisis following the fighting was further exacerbated by the violence occurring during a period of high temperatures, drought and it starting during the fasting month of Ramadan. Civilians were unable to venture outside of their homes to obtain food and supplies for fear of getting caught in the crossfire. A doctors' group said that hospitals remained understaffed and were running low on supplies as wounded people streamed in. The World Health Organization recorded around 26 attacks on healthcare facilities, some of which resulted in casualties among medical workers and civilians. The World Health Organization said 80% of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in the crossfire. This included about half of Khartoum's 130 medical facilities and all hospitals in West Darfur. Outbreaks of diseases such as measles, cholera and diarrhea were reported across the country.", "Treaty of Jeddah\nMain article: Treaty of Jeddah (2023)\n\nInternational attention to the conflict resulted in the United Nations Human Rights Council calling a special session to address the violence, voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses. On 6 May, delegates from the SAF and the RSF met directly for the first time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for what was described by Saudi Arabia and the United States as \"pre-negotiation talks\". After diplomatic lobbying from the Saudis and Americans the warring sides signed the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May, vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians, protect relief workers, and prohibit the use of civilians as human shields. The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and clashes resumed in Geneina, causing more casualties. The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths expressed frustration at the lack of commitment from both sides to end the fighting.\n\nThe situation remained volatile, with both sides trading blame for attacks on churches, hospitals, and embassies. Casualties mounted, particularly in Geneina, where Arab militias loyal to the RSF were accused of atrocities against non-Arab residents. A temporary ceasefire was signed and faced challenges as fighting persisted in Khartoum, and the agreed-upon ceasefire time saw further violence. Between 28 and 97 people were reportedly killed by the RSF and Arab militias when they attacked the predominantly Masalit town of Misterei in West Darfur on 28 May.\nJune\u2013September\nThe RSF took control of the National Museum of Sudan in June.\nContinued fighting in Khartoum\n\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties and injuries. The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex. Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population.\n\nCome July al-Burhan was still trapped at the Army Headquarters and unable to leave, and in order to break him out the SAF elected to send a column of troops to lift the siege of the base. This force was ambushed by the RSF and defeated, with the paramilitary claiming it had killed hundreds of soldiers and captured 90 vehicles, along with the column's commander.\n\nIn response to the escalating violence in Khartoum the SAF increased the intensity of their airstrikes and artillery bombardment, leading to heightened civilian casualties often numbering in the dozens per strike. Shelling by the RSF also increased in intensity, leading to many civilian casualties in turn.\n\nHeavy fighting continued in Khartoum throughout August, with clashes breaking out across the city. The RSF laid siege to the SAF's Armoured Corps base, breaching its defences and taking control of surrounding neighbourhoods. The SAF also made offensives, with the RSF-controlled Republican Palace and Yarmouk Complex coming under SAF air bombardment. An offensive was launched against Yarmouk, but this was beaten back after the RSF shipped in reinforcements. One of the few remaining bridges between Khartoum and Khartoum North was also destroyed by the SAF, in an attempt to deny the RSF freedom of movement.\n\nOn 24 August a SAF military operation successfully rescued al-Burhan from his besieged base at the Army Headquarters, allowing him to head to Port Sudan and hold a cabinet meeting there.\nDiplomatic efforts\n\nCeasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated, leading to further clashes. The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took actions against international envoys. The Saudi embassy in Khartoum was attacked, and evacuations from an orphanage were carried out amid the chaos. Amidst the turmoil, Sudan faced diplomatic strains with Egypt, leading to challenges for Sudanese refugees seeking entry.\n\nWith al-Burhan out of Khartoum for the first time since the start of the war, he was able to fly to Egypt and hold a meeting with the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Following this visit al-Burhan went on a tour of numerous countries, heading to South Sudan, Qatar, Eritrea, Turkey, and Uganda. He then proceeded to New York City as head of the Sudanese delegation to the 78th United Nations General Assembly, where he urged the international community to declare the RSF a terrorist organization."]}, {"query": "Which regions in Chile were affected by wildfires in February 2024, and which regions were placed on red alert due to these wildfires?", "response": "\nAccording to the text, the following regions in Chile were affected by wildfires in February 2024:\n\n* Valpara\u00edso Region: Thousands of people in this region were urged to evacuate due to the deadliest wildfires.\n* Biob\u00edo Region: A fire broke out in the commune of Mulch\u00e9n, and a red alert was declared in the commune of Huala\u00f1\u00e9.\n* Araucan\u00eda Region: A fire broke out in the commune of Galvarino.\n* Los Lagos Region: A red alert was declared in response to the growth of a fire in the Los Lagos Region, which consumed 546 hectares (1,350 acres) and then increased to 804 hectares (1,990 acres).\n\nRegarding the red alerts, the following regions were placed on red alert due to the wildfires:\n\n* Valpara\u00edso Region: A red alert was declared on 2 February due to a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) fire that affected the Las Docas road, south of Valpara\u00edso.\n* Biob\u00edo Region: A red alert was declared on 2 February in the commune of Mulch\u00e9n, and on 3 February in the commune of Huala\u00f1\u00e9.\n* Los Lagos Region: A red alert was declared on 26 January in response to the growth of a fire in the Los Lagos Region.", "contexts": ["In February 2024, a series of wildfires broke out in Chile, affecting multiple regions including Valpara\u00edso, O'Higgins, Maule, Biob\u00edo, and Los Lagos. The most severe incidents occurred in the Valpara\u00edso Region as of 5 February 2024. The Chilean government labeled the fires as the country's worst disaster since the 2010 Chile earthquake, and declared a two-day national mourning period.\nOverview\n\nDeputy Interior Minister Manuel Monsalve reported on 4 February that there were 162 forest fires across central and southern Chile. The region experienced unusually high temperatures, reaching up to 40 \u00baC (104 \u00baF) in the past week, worsened by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and a \"mega-drought\" that has affected the country over the last decade.[10] Over 43,000 hectares of land were affected. As of 4 February, authorities had managed to bring 43 fires under control, while 34 were still being dealt with.[11]\n\nPresident Gabriel Boric suggested that some fires might have been intentionally started, a view supported by Valpara\u00edso Region Governor Rodrigo Mundaca.[12]\nPreceding fires\n\nIn January 2024, two forest fires prompted the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response (SENAPRED) to issue a red alert. One occurred on 20 January in Lonquimay, Araucan\u00eda Region, and another on 26 January in Puerto Montt, Los Lagos Region.[13]\n\nOn 22 January, a fire, named \"Antiquereo 2\", broke out on the boundary of Portezuelo and Trehuaco in the \u00d1uble Region.[14] It was contained by 24 January after consuming 35 hectares (86 acres).[15] SENAPRED responded by declaring a yellow alert in Portezuelo, marking the first alert of the year in the region.[16]\n\nBy the end of January 2024, a fire originating in Florida, Biob\u00edo Region, spread to Quill\u00f3n in the \u00d1uble Region.[17] The \"Casablanca\" fire,[18] covering 69.5 hectares (172 acres) in the Pe\u00f1ablanca sector,[19] was extinguished through collaborative efforts between the Quill\u00f3n and Florida fire departments.[20]\n\nIn the last week of January 2024, a heatwave hit central Chile, with temperatures 10 to 15 \u00b0C (50 to 59 \u00b0F) above the weekly average. Anticipating an increased wildfire risk, the Meteorological Directorate of Chile issued a heat alert on 28 January, projecting temperatures of 36 to 38 \u00b0C (97 to 100 \u00b0F) in valleys and foothills of the central zone and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on the coast of Valpara\u00edso, O'Higgins, and Maule regions.[21]\nBy region\nValpara\u00edso Region\n\nThousands of people in the Valpara\u00edso Region, which have had the deadliest wildfires, were urged to evacuate by the authorities.[22]\n\nAt 3:25 on 2 February, a red alert was declared in Valpara\u00edso Province due to a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) fire that affected the Las Docas road, south of Valpara\u00edso. An hour later, it was announced that the fire affected 5 hectares (12 acres) of land.[23] At 3:10 p.m., another set of fires was reported in the Lago Pe\u00f1uelas National Reserve, affecting 30 hectares (74 acres). The fire was described as one of \"rapid advance and high intensity\", and caused the interruption of vehicular traffic on Routes 68 and F-718.[23] Another fire was reported in Lo Moscoso at 3:54 p.m., affecting 8 hectares (20 acres) in the communes of Quilpu\u00e9 and Villa Alemana. At the same time, authorities placed the Marga Marga province on red alert.[23]\n\nSENAPRED reported that the Lo Moscoso fire extended to 80 hectares (200 acres) at 5:15 p.m., and ordered the evacuation of the Quebrada Escobares and Fundo El Rinc\u00f3n sectors of Villa Alemana. By then, the fire in the Lago Pe\u00f1uelas Reserve had affected \u200b\u200b480 hectares (1,200 acres).[23] By 9:00 p.m., Los Andes, Petorca, Quillota, San Antonio and San Felipe de Aconcagua provinces were also placed on red alert.[24] By 10:00 p.m.", "[36][37] At 19:19, in response to the growth of the fire to 20 hectares (49 acres), the Yellow Alert was upgraded to a Red Alert. This led to the mobilization all available resources for its control, including the additional deployment of Conaf brigades, aircraft and the participation of the Carabineros de Chile to assist in the evacuation of the affected areas. At 10:39 p.m., the \"Santa Laura\" fire was declared \"controlled\" after affecting 30 hectares (74 acres), and prompted the downgrading of the Red Alert to Yellow by Senapred and Conaf, indicating that, although the immediate threat had been overcome, resources would remain on alert to respond to any change in conditions.[38]\n\nAt 10:50 p.m., a red alert was declared in the commune of Huala\u00f1\u00e9, affecting 120 hectares (300 acres).[39] The mobilization of resources in response to the Red Alert was considerable, including the participation of firefighters from several communes (Talca, Huaqu\u00e9n, Pencahue, Maule, San Javier and San Rafael), multiple Conaf brigades and private companies such as Celulosa Arauco, CMPC and Vista Hermosa, as well as the use of planes and helicopters from Conaf and Celulosa Arauco, among other land and technical resources. [35]\nBiob\u00edo Region\n\nOn 2 February at 2:19 a Red Alert was declared for the commune of Mulch\u00e9n due to the \"Mininco VIII\" forest fire. This fire, which is being fought and has affected approximately 150 hectares (370 acres), is characterized by its proximity to populated areas, extreme fire behavior, including flying sparks and erratic winds. Until that time, a brigade from the Conaf is working at the site. On 3 January at 8:48 p.m. the alert was canceled after the fire was declared under control.[40]\nAraucan\u00eda Region\n\nOn 3 February, authorities declared a Red Alert for the commune of Galvarino in response to the \"Colonia Suiza\" and \"Nilpe 4\" forest fires. The \"Colonia Suiza\" fire affected 15 hectares while the \"Nilpe 4\" fire affected 5 hectares (12 acres).[41]\nLos Lagos Region\n\nOn 26 January, a forest fire began in the Los Lagos Region, which led authorities to declare a Yellow Alert after the \"Camino San Antonio\" fire was detected in Puerto Montt, initially affecting 6 hectares (15 acres). The situation quickly worsened, leading to the declaration of a Red Alert on the same day, at 8:36 p.m., in response to the growth of the fire to 63 hectares (160 acres) and its continued proximity to populated areas. This declaration mobilized an expanded set of resources, including Conaf brigades, firefighters from various locations, helicopters, and specialized machinery, to fight the fire effectively and protect the communities at risk.[42]\n\nIn the following days, the Red Alert was maintained, reflecting the persistent severity of the fire, which consumed 546 hectares (1,350 acres) and then increased to 804 hectares (1,990 acres). During this period, preventive evacuations were carried out: on the morning of 28 January 74 people were evacuated from 19 homes in the affected sectors, who returned to their homes in the afternoon of the same day. In addition, temporary shelters were set up and technical tables were held to coordinate the response to the fire.[42]\n\nThe operations included the active participation of firefighters, Conaf brigades, technicians, helicopters managed by both Conaf and Senapred, and the use of highway machinery and private resources. The joint effort between different entities allowed the fire to be fought with a combination of ground and air strategies, including the use of Hercules C-130 aircraft for extinguishing operations. In addition, attention was paid to the safety of brigade members and the well-being of those affected by the fire, with the implementation of evacuation measures and the provision of temporary accommodation for those displaced from their homes.[42]\nCasualties and damage\n\nA total of 131 people were killed in the fires, of whom 35 have been identified so far. The Chilean Forensic Medical Service said many bodies were found to be in bad condition and difficult to identify, prompting them to take DNA samples from people with missing relatives.[43] At least 45 of the dead were found at the scene, while six others died of burn injuries in medical facilities. At least 14,000 houses were affected by the fires in Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Quilpu\u00e9."]}, {"query": "Which international leaders condemned Hamas's attacks on Israel and expressed solidarity with Israel during the Israel-Hamas war in 2023?", "response": "\nMany international leaders condemned Hamas's attacks on Israel and expressed solidarity with Israel during the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.

Germany sent two Heron TP drones to Israel. On 8 November 2023, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs announced that the German government had authorized a tenfold increase in arms exports to Israel; the export of military equipment to Israel would be treated and approved as a priority. Exports worth around 32 million euros in all of 2022 rose to almost 303 million euros in 2023, most of which was authorized after the start of the war.

This force was ambushed by the RSF and defeated, with the paramilitary claiming it had killed hundreds of soldiers and captured 90 vehicles, along with the column's commander.\n\nIn response to the escalating violence in Khartoum the SAF increased the intensity of their airstrikes and artillery bombardment, leading to heightened civilian casualties often numbering in the dozens per strike. Shelling by the RSF also increased in intensity, leading to many civilian casualties in turn.\n\nHeavy fighting continued in Khartoum throughout August, with clashes breaking out across the city. The RSF laid siege to the SAF's Armoured Corps base, breaching its defences and taking control of surrounding neighbourhoods. The SAF also made offensives, with the RSF-controlled Republican Palace and Yarmouk Complex coming under SAF air bombardment. An offensive was launched against Yarmouk, but this was beaten back after the RSF shipped in reinforcements. One of the few remaining bridges between Khartoum and Khartoum North was also destroyed by the SAF, in an attempt to deny the RSF freedom of movement.\n\nOn 24 August a SAF military operation successfully rescued al-Burhan from his besieged base at the Army Headquarters, allowing him to head to Port Sudan and hold a cabinet meeting there.\nDiplomatic efforts\n\nCeasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated, leading to further clashes. The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took actions against international envoys. The Saudi embassy in Khartoum was attacked, and evacuations from an orphanage were carried out amid the chaos. Amidst the turmoil, Sudan faced diplomatic strains with Egypt, leading to challenges for Sudanese refugees seeking entry.\n\nWith al-Burhan out of Khartoum for the first time since the start of the war, he was able to fly to Egypt and hold a meeting with the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Following this visit al-Burhan went on a tour of numerous countries, heading to South Sudan, Qatar, Eritrea, Turkey, and Uganda. He then proceeded to New York City as head of the Sudanese delegation to the 78th United Nations General Assembly, where he urged the international community to declare the RSF a terrorist organization.", "The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took actions against international envoys.

The SAF claimed to have repelled the attacks, while the rebels claimed to have attacked in retaliation for the death of one of their soldiers at the hands of the SAF and vowed to free the region from \"military occupation\". More than 35,000 were displaced by the fighting. Speculation arose as to whether the attacks were part of an unofficial alliance between al-Hilu and the RSF or an attempt by al-Hilu to strengthen his position in future negotiations concerning his group. Civil society organizations supporting the SPLM-N claimed its operations sought to protect civilians from possible attacks by the RSF.\n\nAl-Hilu's faction launched further offensives in July, moving into South Kordofan and gaining control of several SAF bases. In response the SAF brought in artillery and heavily bombarded SPLM-N positions. Further attacks by the group largely petered out after this, with an assault on Kadugli in September being pushed back by the SAF.\nThe Darfur Front\n\nIn Darfur fighting and bloodshed was particularly fierce around the city of Geneina, where hundreds died and extensive destruction occurred. RSF forces engaged in frequent acts of violence against the Masalit population of Geneina, leading to accusations of ethnic cleansing. On 4 August the RSF claimed that it had taken full control over all of Central Darfur.\n\nA United Nations investigation discovered numerous mass graves in Darfur that contained Masalit civilians. The RSF and Arab militias were additionally accused of having killed lawyers, human rights monitors, doctors and non-Arab tribal leaders. The governor of West Darfur, Khamis Abakar, was abducted and killed by armed men in June, hours after accusing the RSF of genocide and calling for international intervention in a TV interview. The SAF, for their part, conducted indiscriminate airstrikes against Darfur that killed many civilians, especially in Nyala.\n\nTribal and rebel groups in Darfur began to declare allegiance to one or the other of the warring parties. A faction of the Darfur-based Sudan Liberation Movement led by Mustafa Tambour (SLM-T) joined the conflict in support of the SAF. In contrast the controversial Tamazuj rebel group formally declared its alliance with the RSF, joined by the leaders of seven Arab tribes, including that of Hemedti's.\n\nAs September arrived both sides made offensives in Darfur. The RSF took control of several towns in West Darfur and also attacked the market of Al-Fashir, the capital of North Darfur. SAF offensives saw success in Central Darfur, with the army retaking parts of Zalingei from the RSF. Fighting in Darfur also began to increasingly spill over into North Kordofan, with the SAF attacking RSF positions in the state capital of El-Obeid and clashes over the town of Um Rawaba. Both sides made withdrawals to end the month, with the RSF retreating from Um Rawaba while the SAF withdrew from Tawila.\nOctober\u2013December\nSAF collapse in Darfur\nBy the end of November, Al-Fashir was the last of the five state capitals in Darfur under SAF control.\n\nBy October, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges, and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances."]}, {"query": "Which Sudanese political and intellectual figures were assassinated during the conflict in Sudan in 2023, and how many cases of sexual assault on women were reported across the country during the same period?", "response": "\nPolitical and intellectual figures assassinated:\nMujebelrahman Yagoub, Assistant Commissioner for Refugees in West Darfur\n\nCases of sexual assault on women reported:\nAt least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, with the RSF being blamed for most of them.

Several intellectuals, politicians, professionals and nobility were assassinated. Most of these atrocities were blamed on the RSF and allied Arab militias. The UK government, witnesses and other observers described the violence in the region as tantamount to ethnic cleansing or even genocide, with non-Arab groups such as the Masalit being the primary victims.

NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400. Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating.\nCasualties among humanitarian workers\n\nIn the Battle of Kabkabiya, three employees of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed after being caught in the crossfire at a military base. Two other staff members were injured. On 18 April, the EU's top humanitarian aid officer in Sudan, Wim Fransen of Belgium, was shot and injured in Khartoum. On 21 April, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that one of its local employees was killed in a crossfire while traveling with his family near El-Obeid. On 20 July, an 18-member team of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res was attacked while transporting supplies to the Turkish Hospital in south Khartoum. By then, the World Health Organization had verified 51 attacks on medical facilities and personnel since the conflict began, resulting in 10 deaths and 24 injuries. On 25 July, Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said 18 aid workers had been killed and over two dozen others were detained or unaccounted for. The conflict has led the United Nations to declare Sudan the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarian workers after South Sudan.\n\nThe situation was further compounded by attacks on humanitarian facilities, with more than 50 warehouses looted, 82 offices ransacked, and over 200 vehicles stolen. One particularly devastating looting incident in El Obeid in early June resulted in the loss of food \"that could have fed 4.4 million people\".\nAttacks on journalists\n\nThe SAF and RSF are accused of threatening, attacking, and killing journalists during the conflict. The Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documented over 40 violations in May alone. Several journalists were injured or killed, and 13 newspapers ceased operations. Humanitarian workers were also targeted, with 18 killed and many others detained.\n\nMedia organizations accused both the SAF and the RSF of threatening, attacking and even killing several journalists during the conflict, with the Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documenting more than 40 such violations during the second half of May alone. Aside from the occupation of state media channels, the RSF raided the offices of the newspapers El Hirak El Siyasi, El Madaniya and the Sudanese Communist Party's El Midan and shot and injured photojournalists Faiz Abubakr, and Ali Shata, while the SAF was accused of circulating lists of journalists it accused of supporting the RSF.\n\nBBC journalist Mohamed Othman was reportedly attacked and beaten in Khartoum while a correspondent and cameramen for the El Sharg news outlet were detained for hours near Merowe airport on the first day of the fighting on 15 April. On 16 June, Al Jazeera journalists Osama Sayed Ahmed and Ahmed El Buseili were shot by snipers in Khartoum, while the RSF detained two of the channel's other reporters, Ahmed Fadl and Rashid Gibril, in Khartoum on 16 May, and subsequently looted Fadl's residence. During a live report on 29 April, al-Arabiya correspondent Salem Mahmoud was interrupted and questioned by the RSF.", "On 23 April, a French evacuation convoy was shot at, injuring one person. The French government later confirmed the casualty to be a French soldier. An employee of the Egyptian embassy was shot and injured during an evacuation mission.\nNotable deaths\n\nAsia Abdelmajid, an actress, was killed in a crossfire in Khartoum North. A singer, Shaden Gardood, was killed in a crossfire in Omdurman, as was former football player Fozi el-Mardi and his daughter. Araki Abdelrahim, a member of the music group Igd al-Jalad, was killed by the shelling of a mosque in the El-Shajara neighborhood of west Khartoum. The governor of West Darfur, Khamis Abakar, was abducted and killed by armed men hours after accusing the RSF of genocide and calling for international intervention in a TV interview. Ahmed Abkar Barqo Abdel-Rahman, a former member of parliament and a Zaghawa, was killed by the RSF in a raid on his house in Nyala.\nForeign involvement\nEgypt\n\nOn 16 April, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference. According to former CIA analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian special forces units have been deployed and are providing intelligence and tactical support to the SAF. The Wall Street Journal said that Egypt had sent fighter jets and pilots to support the Sudanese military. On 17 April, satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone revealed that one Egyptian Air Force MiG-29M2 fighter jet had been destroyed and two others had been damaged or destroyed at Merowe Airbase. A Sudanese Air Force Guizhou JL-9 was among the destroyed aircraft. After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military prior to the outbreak of hostilities.\nEgyptian POWs\n\nOn 15 April, RSF forces claimed, via Twitter, to have taken Egyptian troops prisoner near Merowe, and a military plane carrying markings of the Egyptian Air Force. Initially, no official explanation was given for the Egyptian soldiers' presence, while Egypt and Sudan have had military cooperation due to diplomatic tensions with Ethiopia. Later on, the Egyptian Armed Forces stated that around 200 of its soldiers were in Sudan to conduct exercises with the Sudanese military. Around that time, the SAF reportedly encircled RSF forces in Merowe airbase. As a result, the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that it was following the situation as a precaution for the safety of its personnel.[better source needed] The RSF later stated that it would cooperate in repatriating the soldiers to Egypt. On 19 April, the RSF stated that it had moved the soldiers to Khartoum and would hand them over when the \"appropriate opportunity\" arose. One hundred and seventy-seven of the captured Egyptian troops were released and flown back to Egypt aboard three Egyptian military planes that took off from Khartoum airport later in the day. The remaining 27 soldiers, who were from the Egyptian Air Force, were sheltered at the Egyptian embassy and later evacuated.\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nA report published by the Wall Street Journal on 10 August quoted Ugandan officials as saying that an Emirati plane on a stopover at Entebbe Airport en route to Amdjarass International Airport in eastern Chad turned out upon inspection to have been carrying dozens of green plastic crates in the plane's cargo hold filled with ammunition, assault rifles and other small arms\", rather than food and other aid officially listed on the aircraft's manifest supposedly meant for Sudanese refugees. Despite the discovery, the plane was allowed to take off, and the officials said they received orders from their superiors not to inspect any more planes from the UAE. Prior to this, the UAE had long been accused of supporting the RSF. The UAE Foreign Ministry subsequently denied the allegations, saying that the country \"does not take sides\" in the conflict.\n\nOfficials from the US, European and African countries claimed that the UAE was running a covert operation to back the RSF. Since June, Emirati cargo planes were identified landing in Amdjarass in Chad, where an airfield and a hospital were being used for the operation. The UAE insisted its operation was purely humanitarian, but officials stated that it involved supplying powerful weapons and drones to the RSF, treating their injured fighters and airlifting serious cases to their military hospital."]}, {"query": "Which militant group, designated as a terrorist entity by several countries, gained control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 and has since engaged in conflicts with Israel, leading to significant damage to the Gaza Strip's economy and widespread poverty among its population?", "response": "Hamas", "contexts": ["An armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups has been taking place chiefly in and around the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023. On that day, Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, initiating the most significant military escalation in the region, 50 years after the Yom Kippur War. After clearing Hamas militants from its territory, the Israeli military embarked on an extensive aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion beginning on 27 October. Clashes have also occurred in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and with Hezbollah along the Israel\u2013Lebanon border. The hostilities constitute the fifth war of the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict since 2008, part of the broader Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise offensive against Israel named \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.\" The attack began with a barrage of rockets targeting Israel, while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza\u2013Israel barrier and attacked neighboring Israeli communities and military bases. During this attack, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, including 766 civilians and 373 security forces. Analysts suggested that Palestinian frustration at Arab\u2013Israeli normalization despite the ongoing blockade of Gaza and rising settler violence in the West Bank contributed to the attack. Hamas said its attack was in response to the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, as well as the alleged \"Judaization\" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners, whom it sought to free by taking an estimated 253 Israeli and foreign captives to the Gaza Strip as leverage. In response, Israel declared a state of war, tightened its blockade, ordered the evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip, and launched \"Operation Swords of Iron\" with the stated goals of destroying Hamas, freeing the hostages and at least temporarily controlling the Gaza Strip.\n\nSince the start of the Israeli operation, more than 27,840 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including over 10,000 children, 152 UN staff members, 70 journalists, and 7,000 women with another 7,000 people missing and presumed dead under the rubble of destroyed buildings. By mid-December, Israel had dropped 29,000 munitions on Gaza, destroying or damaging 70 percent of homes in the Strip. Experts say that the scale and pace of destruction in Gaza is among the most severe in recent history. A humanitarian crisis has developed in the Gaza Strip, with healthcare in a state of collapse, shortages of food, clean water, medicine and fuel due to the blockade, electricity and communications blackouts, and the UN warning of potential famine. It was widely reported that there is \"no safe place in Gaza\" as Israel struck areas it had previously told Palestinians to evacuate to. The widespread civilian deaths have led to accusations of war crimes against both Israel and Hamas. Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million population have been internally displaced and around 250,000\u2013500,000 Israelis were internally displaced, while thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel, and Israel has lost 225 additional soldiers in its invasion as of 4 February 2024.\n\nThroughout the war, there have been widespread global protests that have primarily called for a ceasefire. Israel and the United States were internationally isolated amid global calls for a ceasefire, with the latter vetoing multiple proposals for one at the UN Security Council, instead allowing a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause to pass on 15 November. During a subsequent seven-day truce, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners. US military and diplomatic support for Israel during the war has been condemned by various human rights groups. In response to Washington's backing of Israel, Iranian-backed militias attacked American bases in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan.

Most were civilians.\n\nIsrael occupied the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, in 1967. In 1987, the First Intifada, a popular uprising by the Palestinians against the Israeli occupation, began. The conflict lasted five years and ended with the Oslo Accords, creating the Palestinian National Authority and dividing the West Bank into three administrative areas. Following the failure of the subsequent peace talks at the Camp David Summits in 2000, violence once again escalated during the Second Intifada, which ended with the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit and Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and subsequent blockade.\n\nHamas, an Islamist militant group, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and a subsequent battle in the Gaza Strip between it and Fatah, which led to it taking over governance in the strip, and further escalating tensions with Israel. Israel, along with Egypt, imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza's economy, citing security concerns as the justification. International rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment, while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory.\n\nSince the blockade, Israel and Palestinian militants have had several clashes and made attacks on each other. The Palestinian Authority has not held national elections since 2006. Hamas tunneled under the border wall to launch cross-border attacks and fired rockets into Israeli territory. This led to multiple conflicts, escalating into outright wars. Israel relied on the Iron Dome rocket defense system for defense, and responded with targeted strikes into Gaza, aiming to minimize the militant threat. Surveys in 2023 of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank before the war indicated that a majority supported the use of \"armed struggle\", the creation of \"militant groups\", and an intifada (\"uprising\") against the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe Gaza Strip's economy declined greatly due to the blockade, with a 30% drop in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) within a year. By 2015, the unemployment rate had risen to 45% (compared to the pre-blockade level of 10%). In 2023, UNRWA statistics for Gaza reported 81% of people living below the poverty level, and 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance. According to UNICEF, \"Israel only approves 64%\" of patients' requests to leave Gaza for specialized medical treatment. According to an analysis in The Independent, the Gaza blockade created hopelessness among Palestinians, which was exploited by Hamas, convincing young Palestinian men that violence was their only solution. Daoud Kuttab wrote that Palestinian attempts to solve the conflict via negotiations or non-violent boycotts have been fruitless.\n\nHamas is designated as a terrorist entity by the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, the European Union, and others. Other UNSC permanent members China and Russia have not done so. A 2018 attempt to condemn Hamas for \"acts of terror\" at the United Nations failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority, with 87 votes in favor, 58 votes against, 32 abstentions and 16 non-votes. The UN Israeli Ambassador at the time criticized the procedure, stating the vote had been \"hijacked\" due to a change in procedure requiring a two-thirds majority instead of a simple majority which would have passed the motion.\n\nIn February\u2013March 2021, Fatah and Hamas reached agreement to jointly conduct elections for a new Palestinian legislative assembly, in accordance with the Oslo Accords. Hamas committed to upholding international law, transferring control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Mahmoud Abbas subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States. Soon after the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis exploded, the Al-Qassam Brigades started planning the operation which would break out on 7 October 2023."]}, {"query": "Which countries have been accused of providing military support to Baloch separatist groups in Pakistan, according to the provided documentation sample?", "response": "\nAccording to the provided documentation sample, the following countries have been accused of providing military support to Baloch separatist groups in Pakistan:\n\n1.

Wright-Neville writes that the Pakistani government and some Western observers[which?] believe that India secretly funds the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).\n\nThe former American Af-Pak envoy Richard Holbrooke said in 2011 that while Pakistan had repeatedly shared its allegations with Washington, it had failed to provide any evidence to the United States that India was involved with separatist movements in Balochistan. He did not consider Pakistan's accusations against India credible. Holbrooke also strongly rejected the allegation that India was using its consulates in Afghanistan to facilitate Baloch rebel activity, saying he had \"no reason to believe Islamabad's charges\", and that \"Pakistan would do well to examine its own internal problems\". In 2009, a Washington-based think tank, the Center for International Policy, published a report stating that no evidence of Indian involvement in Balochistan had been provided by Pakistan, and that the allegations made by Pakistan lacked credibility, as Baloch rebels had been fighting with \"ineffectual small arms\".\n\nIndia has categorically denied the allegations, pointing to Pakistan's failure to provide evidence.\n\nBrahamdagh Bugti stated in a 2008 interview that he would accept aid from India, Afghanistan, and Iran in defending Balochistan. When asked about the alleged links between his group and India, he is reported to have laughed and said, \"Would our people live amid such miserable conditions if we enjoyed support from India?\" Baloch National Front secretary Karima Baloch claims that the allegations against India are an \"excuse to label [the] ingrown Balochistan freedom movement as a proxy war to cover up the war crimes [the] Pakistani state has committed in Balochistan\".\n\nOn 29 March 2016, the Pakistani government announced that it had apprehended a serving Indian naval officer, Kulbhushan Yadav, who, in a video interview, admitted that he had been tasked by the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) with destabilizing Pakistan. The Indian government confirmed that Yadav was a former naval officer but denied that \"this individual was involved in subversive activities in Pakistan at our [the Indian government's] behest\", and asserted that he operated \"a legitimate business in Iran\", from where he may have been \"abducted\" by Pakistan or, alternatively, by the extremist militant organization Jaishul Adil.\n\nIn 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized Pakistan and alleged human rights issues in Balochistan during an Independence Day speech. Pakistan condemned Modi's remarks, calling it an attempted diversion from violence in Kashmir and a reiteration of Pakistani allegations vis-a-vis Indian involvement in Balochistan. Modi's comments were welcomed by exiled Baloch separatist leaders but sparked anti-India protests by political organizations and locals in Balochistan.\n\nOn 8 October 2015, the Indian newspaper The Hindu confirmed the presence of Balaach Pardili, a representative of the Balochistan Liberation Organisation (BLO), in India. Balaach Pardili hails from Afghanistan and has been living in Delhi since 2009. Hyrbyair Marri, leader of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), had assigned Pardili the task of representing him in public events in India. Mr. Pardili appeared in public on 4 October 2015, under the banner of Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena (BSKS). His presence in India angered Pakistan. A Pakistani diplomat stated that in response to Pardili's presence in India, Pakistan could take up the issue in India's troubled North-Eastern region.\n\nNaela Quadri Baloch and her son Mazdak Dilshad Baloch also live in India. Mazdak Dilshad Baloch organizes campaigns in India to support the Baloch cause, while his mother, Naela Quadri Baloch, is trying to gain support for the establishment of a Baloch Government-in-exile in India. However, Naela Quadri Baloch's proposal for a Government-in-exile has been strongly opposed by other Baloch separatist leaders, such as Brahamdagh Bugti, who claim that Naela Quadri does not represent the Baloch people.\n\nOn 7 May 2020, a retired Indian Army Major speaking on live television threatened to harm Pakistani soldiers in Balochistan.", "The US government, which has officially designated Jundallah a terrorist organisation, has denied this charge. Iran has been angered by JAA's use of Pakistani territory as a refuge, and has threatened military operations in Pakistan to counter insurgent groups \"on several occasions\".\nImpact on Iran-Pakistan Relations\nSee also: Iran\u2013Pakistan relations\nFurther information: Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar, 2024 Iranian missile strikes in Pakistan, and 2024 Iran\u2013Pakistan border skirmishes\n\nRelations between Iran and Pakistan are generally peaceful, but accusations of harboring Baloch militants have stoked distrust on both sides.\n\nIn January 2024, the Iranian and Pakistani militaries successively attacked separatist targets in border areas. Iran's missile strikes and Pakistan's operation stoke regional tensions.\nDrivers of insurgency\n\nIn Balochistan, Pakistan, \"drivers\" of insurgency have been economic, cultural, involving immigration and human rights.\n\nThe immediate reasons for joining one of the several separatist militant groups vary among militants with citing the allure of power and excitement, a desire to honor their centuries-old tribal codes, gaining recognition for their region's distinct ethnicity and even a belief in hard-line communism. Another cited reason by some is employment and funding to work as mercenaries for foreign state agencies.\nEconomic inequality\n\nEconomic inequality, and Balochistan's status as a \"neglected province where a majority of population lacks amenities\" is a dimension in the conflict. Since the mid-1970s Balochistan's share of Pakistan's GDP has dropped from 4.9 to 3.7%. Balochistan has the highest infant and maternal mortality rate, the highest poverty rate, and the lowest literacy rate in Pakistan.\n\nOn the other hand, according to a report published in the Pakistani English-language Dawn newspaper, members of Balochistan's elite society, including provincial government ministers and officials, own \"pieces of land greater in size than some small towns of the country\", and had luxury vehicles, properties, investments and businesses valued at millions of rupees.\nDevelopment issues\nGas revenue\n\nBalochistan receives less per/unit in royalties than Sindh and Punjab provinces, since Balochistan's wellhead price five times lower than in Sindh and Punjab (the gas wellhead price is based on per capita provincial income in 1953). Furthermore, the government has returned little of the royalties owed to the province, citing the need to recover operating costs. Consequently, Balochistan is heavily in debt.\n\nBalochistan Province receives Rs 32.71 per unit on gas revenues, including a royalty of Rs 13.90, excise duty of Rs 5.09, and gas development surcharge of Rs 13.72. Many private individuals with gas deposits on their land also receive payments. Many Balochs argue that such royalties are too low. In response, in 2011 Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani announced an addition of Rs. 120 billion (US$2.5 billion) to the gas development surcharge and royalty portion of the \"Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan\" package. However, royalties often do not trickle down to the common people in Balochistan due to the corruption and wealth-hoarding of Baloch tribal chiefs. This has hindered the growth of infrastructure.[citation needed]\nRegional inequality\n\nExtensive road and rail links developed by British colonialists in northern parts of Balochistan province have brought greater economic development to areas mainly inhabited by ethnic Pashtuns, which has also heightened nationalism among ethnic Balochs living in the southern parts of the within the province.\nGwadar\n\nPurchased by the government of Pakistan from Oman in 1958, the construction of the megaport of Gwadar beginning in 2002 became another source of grievances. Baloch complain that construction of the port relies on Chinese engineers and labourers, and few Balochs have been employed. A parallel town for workers at Gwadar is being built close to the old one to segregate Balochs from the growing influx of outsiders.\n\nThe Pakistani government has stationed soldiers in the area to secure it from insurgent attacks.\nMulticulturalism and immigration\n\nDue to the historical shortage of skilled labour in Balochistan, skilled workers are often imported from other regions. Their arrival means new industries can develop, boosting the local economy; however, nationalists argue that this creates resentment amongst the local inhabitants.\n\nAfter the Soviet invasion, around 4 million refugees from Afghanistan arrived and settled in the region which has resulted in substantial demographic imbalance.

Many are innocent and stuck in Pakistan's slow court system whilst others are in prison awaiting charges on a range of things such as gun smuggling and robbery. The chief justice of an apex court of Pakistan asked about the situation and said it was going out of control in Balochistan. The Supreme Court is currently investigating the \"missing persons\" and issued an arrest warrant for the former Military Dictator Pervez Musharaff. Furthermore, the Chief Justice of the court said the military must act under the government's direction and follow well-defined parameters set by the Constitution.\nMissing people found\n\nIn June 2011, the prime minister was informed that 41 missing people had returned to their homes, false cases against 38 had been withdrawn and several others had been traced. The PM urged police to trace the missing people and help them to return to their homes. In 2011, government established a commission which registered 5,369 missing person's complaints. The commission claims to have traced more than 3,600 people. In October 2018, Balochistan National Party (Mengal) (BNP-M) claimed that around 300 missing Baloch persons had returned their homes.

This is challenged by Baloch nationalist groups, who argue the benefits of these policies have not accrued to native Baloch residents of the province.[citation needed] Baloch nationalist groups continue to highlight the extraction of natural resources, especially natural gas, from the province, without discernible economic benefit to the Baloch people.[citation needed] Nonetheless, the government of Pakistan continues to insist that industrial zones are planned along the new Gawadar-Karachi highway.

Nur Muhammad Taraki reopened the Baloch training camps in Afghanistan and once again started offering arms and aid to Baloch rebels.\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks cables published in 2010, the then-president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, had been providing shelter to Brahumdagh Bugti for several years. Brahumdagh Bugti, along with some 20 separatists, had fled to Afghanistan in 2006, and his presence in Afghanistan had created tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In 2007 Pakistan's president, Pervaiz Musharraf, stated that Bugti was freely traveling between Kabul and Kandahar, raising money and planning attacks against Pakistani security forces. Musharraf repeatedly asked Hamid Karzai to hand over Bugti, which Karzai refused to do. In public, Afghan officials denied providing shelter to Bugti, but later, following a 2009 meeting between UN officials and Karzai, admitted that Bugti was indeed living in Kabul. While speaking to The Guardian, Bugti admitted that he was leading the fight against Pakistan's army. In 2010 he travelled to Switzerland and took up residence there. In 2017, his request for political asylum was rejected by Swiss authorities on the grounds that he had been linked to \"incidents of terrorism, violence and militant activities\".\n\nThe Chief of Frontier Corps troops in Balochistan, Major General Obaidullah Khan Khattak, said in June 2012 that \"over 30 militant camps\" had been established in Afghanistan.

A BLA spokesman confirmed their deaths. Afghan officials stated that General Abdul Raziq Achakzai had housed Aslam Baloch and other separatist in Kandahar for years. Moreover, the Afghan news channel TOLOnews reported that Aslam Baloch had been residing in Afghanistan since 2005.

Afghan provincial council member Yousaf Younasi . said it was the second attack on Baloch Liberation Army members in recent years in Kandahar's posh Aino Mina residential area, and that Aslam Baloch, alias Achu, had been killed in the same area. Baloch separatist leader Sher Muhammad Bugti confirmed that the attack had taken place, but said that target of the attack was a senior separatist leader, Shah Wali Bugti. He said that 'Baloch separatist are not safe in Kandahar and they have come under attack in three places over the past few months'.

In a book he authored, Paliwal says these officers claim that \"we gave Baloch everything, from money to guns, during the 1970s, everything\". He further states that, like Pakistan and India, Iraq and Iran were bitter rivals. As a result, Pakistan and Iran had developed closer relations with each other, while India and Iraq did likewise.

Hamid Murtada, a member of the resistance committees, described the resistance committees as having \"an important role in raising awareness to their constituencies and in supporting initiatives that [would] end the war immediately\".\n\nOn 22 and 23 April, protests against the conflict were held by residents in Khartoum Bahri, Arbaji, and Damazin. On 30 July, different groups in Kadugli organized marches against the violence in South Kordofan, some of whom supported the SAF, while others condemned the SAF, the RSF and the SPLM-N (al-Hilu).\n\nOn 25 July, following a meeting in Cairo, four Sudanese political groupings, namely the Forces for Freedom and Change, the National Movement Forces, the National Accord Forces, and the National Forces Alliance, called on al-Burhan to form \"a caretaker government\" as soon as possible to rule the country during the war and promote dialogue.\n\nOn 30 July, nurses of the Port Sudan Teaching Hospital Emergency Department went on strike in protest over the non-payment of salaries since the beginning of the conflict, forcing the closure of the hospital since then after other departments joined.", "The committee was to be chaired by a representative of the Attorney General, and also included officials from the Foreign and Justice Ministries, the SAF, the Police, the General Intelligence Service, and the National Commission for Human Rights.

The draft motion, which condemns the human rights violations during the conflict, aimed to establish a three-person Fact Finding Mission to investigate these allegations. The experts would document the violations and provide updates to the 47-member Council. The draft has been circulated among member countries but has not yet been formally submitted to the Council.

Both the SAF and the RSF engaged in disinformation campaigns on social media platforms. The RSF heavily relied on tweets and inauthentic behavior to spread its agenda and influence local and international opinions. On the other hand, the Sudanese army used Twitter to refute RSF claims and boost army morale with false victory claims. The RSF had dedicated teams based in Khartoum and Dubai to engage in a digital propaganda war. They used social media, including officially verified Facebook and Twitter accounts, to showcase their activities and spread disinformation.\n\nVarious misleading videos were shared on social media platforms, falsely depicting scenes of violence in the ongoing fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces.

She compared the plan to a \"pretty architectural sketch with no engineering assessment.\"\nGovernment legal advisors\n\nThe coalition has published a draft bill to reclassify ministry legal advisers from independent authorities to politically selected counsel whose opinions are explicitly non-binding upon the government and its ministers. The draft bill determines that \"legal advice given to the government\" or to \"the prime minister and all government ministers, will not obligate it or be able to alter its legal position\", and that the cabinet and its ministers are \"authorized to reject legal advice and operate against it.\" This would substantially change the system which has been in place till today, whereby each ministry's legal adviser falls under the aegis of the Attorney General to preserve their independence from political influence, and their advice is binding upon ministries.\n\nThe immediate former Attorney General, Avichai Mendelblit, has formerly criticized past attempts to pass such laws, stating that \"letting ministers appoint legal advisers \u2014 instead of the current system of election through public tender \u2014 would politicize the position and harm the integrity of Israeli democracy's 'gatekeepers.'\"\n\nYedidia Stern, former dean of the Law Faculty at Bar-Ilan University, has criticized the bill, explaining that a public legal advisor has duties to both \"the government ministry to which he is appointed, and the public. In addition to legal advice, an attorney in the public service is also responsible for safeguarding the rule of law, for the benefit of us all. This dual role justifies dual input \u2014 by the minister and by the Attorney General \u2014 in the selection of ministry legal advisors.\"\n\nGuy Lurie of the Israel Democracy Institute has argued that \"In order to safeguard the legality of government actions and prevent corruption, the legal advisors must be independent when issuing their legal opinions, and professionally subordinate to the Attorney General, rather than to the minister.\"\nConstitutional review\n\nThe reform proposes to codify the Supreme Court's power of judicial review, which to date has not been set in legislation. In the face of the absence of such legislation, following the 1992 passing of the Human Dignity and Liberty Basic Law the Supreme Court has delineated such power to itself, including in a landmark decision, the 1995 Mizrahi Bank decision, similar to the US Supreme Court's 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison.\n\nThe bill approved by the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee on 13 February 2023, explicitly states \"the non-justiciability of basic laws, stipulating that a [court] holding adjudication power by law, including the Supreme Court, will not address, directly or indirectly, a question regarding the validity of a basic law, and no ruling on such a matter will be valid.\"\n\nThe government has also proposed that if the Knesset passes a regular law that contradicts existing Basic Laws, it will not be considered automatically void, and only the Supreme Court, with a full quorum of all its judges (excluding those precluded from participating for over 30 days from the day that the matter is to be decided) can preside over the law's nullification. Proponents of the change argue that this is in order to guarantee a comprehensive discussion with the full range of views in the Supreme Court, as well as to prevent the discussion from being influenced by the supposed haphazard nature of the panel. It is further proposed that the majority needed to nullify a law is a majority of eighty percent of the total judges, with the argument being that the nullification of a law passed by an elected government should be exceptional (even if it contradicts existing Basic Laws), and if several judges do not decide to nullify the newer contradicting law, the will of the elected government should prevail.\n\nThe proposed legislation argues that as the Basic Laws are Israel's supreme legal norms, the Court derives its power of judicial review from the Basic Laws themselves and thus cannot review or strike down the Basic Laws themselves. The proposal seeks to deny judicial review over Basic Laws, in order to guarantee the Supreme Court's subjection to the rule of name and to the source of democratic authority.\n\nProponents of this change argue that this is similar to the majority of Western countries in which there is no judicial review over constitutional norms. The legal advisor to the Committee through which this reform is being progressed published an opinion stating he had found no precedent in any democratic country for judicial review over legislation to require a unanimous decision of every judge on the relevant court.", "Without judicial review they will be able to protect one another through the mechanism of parliamentary immunity.\"\n\nRuvi Ziegler, the programme director for Master of Laws in International Law, Human Rights and Advanced Legal Studies at the University of Reading, has written that \"the plan would strip courts of their power to hold the Executive properly accountable for its administrative decisions. This means decisions made by public authorities from the police to the tax authority, would no longer need to be considered \"reasonable\" to be accepted in judicial review. In practical terms this means anyone could be denied a license, a benefit, a service without being given suitable reasons and without having an effective remedy. The \"reasonableness\" standard, which is a key part of British legal heritage, is critical for good governance and must be maintained in the Israeli setting as well.\"\nStatus of the Attorney-General\n\nAccording to the Government Basic Law Amendment proposed by Knesset Member Simcha Rothman, the government and ministers will be authorized to determine its legal position in any matter. Furthermore, they will be entitled to accept or reject the Attorney-General's advice. Currently, according to Supreme Court rulings, the Attorney-General's legal opinion is considered to reflect, from the point of view of the government, the current legal status, as long as the court does not rule otherwise.\n\nThe government will also be entitled to determine its position that will be presented in court. The government will be entitled to private representation should the Attorney-General refuse to represent its position. Currently, if the Attorney-General refuses to defend the government's position or presents another position, the Attorney General may decline to defend the government's action in court, and if the division of opinions is based on a legitimate interpretative conflict, the Attorney General may grant the government recourse to different legal representation.\n\nThe position of binding advice and representational monopoly in Israel is exceptional and even unique by global standards. As Dr. Eitan Levontin describes, \"there is no such thing, to the best of my understanding, in any other place. The legal situation in Israel is not a minority opinion, but rather a single opinion, and it seems to me that a chasm \u2014 not just a disagreement \u2014 lies between it and the legal situation in any comparable country.\" By contrast, in the UK, the US, Canada and Germany, the AG \u2014 or the parallel figure \u2014 is a political role similar to the minister, and in some countries is actually a government minister. As such, they have no power to bind the government to their positions; the government can act in oppositions to their positions; the government is authorized to dictate to the AG the position to present before courts; and he is forbidden to put together legal opinions absent government request.\n\nThe position of the Attorney General in Israel can only be understood against the background of the particular history of this position in Israel and against the background of Israel's regime, with its relatively weak system of checks and balances. For example, in a statement published by tens of Canadian legal experts, including former Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin and other former Justices of the Supreme Court, the differences between Israel and Canada's political systems were discussed, with the conclusion that \"Israel's system of government differs from that of other democracies, like Canada's, in its exceptional concentration of political power. Other democracies have a suite of mechanisms that distribute or moderate the exercise of political power.\"\nReactions\nMain article: Reactions to the 2023 Israeli judicial reform\n\nThe government's proposed reforms have sparked intense controversy in Israel. Opposition leaders, activists, retired senior public servants, retired officials of the security services, executives of Israel's banks and financial institutions, leading business figures, economists and jurists have harshly criticized the proposed changes, arguing they will undermine judicial independence and effectively grant the government unchecked power.\n\nThe proposed reforms have led to large-scale protests, with opposition parties cooperating with grassroots activists to coordinate marches, strikes and demonstrations. The protesters include reservists in Israel's security services, with some stating that they will not report for reserve duty while the proposed changes to the judicial system are being progressed through legislation. They also include members of Israel's financial and tech sectors.\n\nThe reforms have received support from some academics, with 120 professors and retired politicians expressing their support. It has also received support from religious Zionist rabbis and members of the political right, who have staged counter-protests in response to opposition demonstrations.\n\nInternational legal figures, economists and politicians have expressed concern over the reforms, as have Jewish organizations internationally, including in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. US President Joe Biden and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock have stated their concern regarding the reforms. Some jurists have expressed support for the reforms."]}, {"query": "Which countries filed a referral of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and what actions did they ask the ICC to take regarding Israel's conduct during the war?", "response": "\nCountries that filed a referral of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war to the International Criminal Court (ICC) are South Africa and Palestine.\n\nRegarding the actions asked by these countries, South Africa requested that the ICC investigate and prosecute Israel for the crimes of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed during the war, particularly the siege of Gaza and the use of force against civilians. Additionally, South Africa sought provisional measures to stop Israel from continuing to commit these crimes until the ICC can render a decision.\n\nPalestine, on the other hand, requested that the ICC investigate and prosecute both Israel and Hamas for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict. Palestine also sought provisional measures to stop both Israel and Hamas from committing further crimes until the ICC can render a decision.\n\nIt is important to note that the ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committed in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, as these areas are occupied territories according to international law.", "contexts": ["On 29 December, South Africa submitted a case to the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza and requested provisional measures for Israel to suspend its military campaign in Gaza. In its filing, South Africa alleged that Israel's actions were \"intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.\" On 2 January 2024, Israel decided to appear before the ICJ in response to the case made by South Africa. The Court issued an Order in relation to the provisional measures request on 26 January 2024 in which it ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts that could be considered genocidal but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. It determined that it was \"plausible\" that some of Israel's actions may violate the Genocide Convention. The final ruling is expected to take years.\nSiege of Gaza\nSee also: Siege of Gaza City and Urban warfare\nIsraeli soldiers operating in a ruined Gazan neighborhood\n\nIsrael imposed a \"complete siege\" on Gaza in the first ten days of the war, due to security concerns that weapons, fuel and armaments would be transferred to Hamas in the guise of humanitarian aid. Israel later allowed the delivery of limited humanitarian aid following security checks. Israel's restriction of the flow of food, fuel, water and other humanitarian aid was criticized as a war crime by human rights organizations.\n\nTom Dannenbaum, co-director of the Center for International Law & Governance at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, wrote that the order \"commands the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime.\" Oxfam issued a statement that accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war, saying \"International Humanitarian Law (IHL) strictly prohibits the use of starvation as a method of warfare and as the occupying power in Gaza, Israel is bound by IHL obligations to provide for the needs and protection of the population of Gaza\".\n\nGeoffrey S. Corn, Chair of Criminal Law and Director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, and Sean Watts, professor in the Department of Law at the United States Military Academy at West Point, write that sieges are subject to the same laws of war as other military tactics such as distinction and proportionality. Watts previously wrote that Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention \"requires that parties to a conflict allow passage of a limited class of relief supplies for civilians...only if the parties are satisfied no advantage will result 'to the military efforts or economy of the enemy'\", but that if the law is interpreted to allow \"incidental\" starvation of civilians proportional to anticipated military advantage, it \"reduces the rule's humanitarian effect, perhaps to the vanishing point.\"\n\nAmnesty International called for an urgent investigation into Israel's mass detentions and the enforced disappearance of Palestinians in Gaza, noting that the disappearances and treatment of captives could amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity.\nProportionality and distinction\n\nIt has been debated whether Israel is respecting the principles of discrimination and proportionality as required under the laws of war. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has stated that the overall civilian death toll, and Israel's use of powerful weapons in Gaza's densely-populated neighbourhoods, raised \"serious questions\" about the legality of Israel's conduct. HRW further argued that a higher proportion of casualties among women and children is indicative of a lack of proportionality, demonstrating what they describe as \"a disregard toward Palestinian lives\". United Nations officials and human rights groups have argued that Israel has not done enough to protect civilians.\n\nEmanuela-Chiara Gillard, an associate fellow at Chatham House, argued that, given the size and nature of the 7 October attacks, Israel has a right of self-defence that could include its stated military aim of destroying Hamas, which has threatened to repeat its assault and eradicate the state of Israel. According to The Economist, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and international humanitarian law (IHL) grant Israel flexibility when it comes to taking military action against Hamas, but in its view, Israel's \"definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point.\"\n\nAmichai Cohen, an Israeli lawyer, alleges that Israel does not deliberately target civilians but that Hamas's tactics make it hard to take action without affecting civilians. Jill Goldenziel, a professor at the United States National Defense University and Marine Corps University, states that if Israel conducted every strike legally and with utmost precision, civilian casualties in war would still remain, and the goal of a proportionality analysis is to decide whether they are excessive. Israeli security officials state that their proportionality criteria in this conflict are unchanged and that they receive legal advice in relation to strikes.", "On 9 November, Israel agreed to daily four-hour \"humanitarian pauses\" to allow civilians to obtain food and medicine, as well as evacuate to the south. Evacuees described the evacuation path as full of death and horror. Jan Egeland, the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said on 5 December that \"The pulverising of Gaza now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age. Each day we see more dead children and new depths of suffering for the innocent people enduring this hell\".\n\nOn 12 December, the UN General Assembly once again voted overwhelmingly for a resolution on immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza and aid access. The resolution attracted 153 votes in favor and 23 abstentions; 10 countries voted against, namely Israel, the United States, Austria, the Czech Republic, Guatemala, Liberia, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea and Paraguay.\n\nDue to an agreement reportedly brokered by Qatar and France between Israel and Hamas, medicine was scheduled to leave Doha via two military aircraft and be delivered to the Gaza Strip on 17 January 2024 to aid hostages. The medicine was successfully delivered.\nAllegations of war crimes\nMain article: War crimes in the Israel\u2013Hamas war\nSee also: Israel\u2013Hamas war hostage crisis\n\nBoth Hamas and the IDF have been accused of attempted or imminent genocide, and several other war crimes, based on their actions in the war.\n\nThe International Criminal Court issued a statement on 10 October confirming that its mandate to investigate alleged war crimes committed since June 2014 in the State of Palestine extends to the current conflict. ICC prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan visited the Rafah crossing and said \"the ICC is independently looking at the situation in Palestine,\" including \"events in Israel and allegations that Palestinian nationals have also committed crime.\" The UN Human Rights Council said it had \"clear evidence\" of war crimes by both sides. The Permanent United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Israel Palestine conflict said there is \"clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable.\"\n2023 Hamas attack on Israel\nGenocide accusations\nMain articles: Allegations of genocide in the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel\n\nSeveral experts in international law and genocide studies characterized Hamas's assault as genocide. Legal and genocide experts have condemned the attack, during which 1,139 people were killed, including 695 Israeli civilians. They argue that these actions by Hamas constitute a significant violation of international law and were carried out with the intent to destroy the Israeli national group. Some commentators highlight Hamas's founding charter, which calls for the destruction of Israel; this has led to suggestions that its intent is genocidal and that the attacks on 7 October were an attempt to fulfill this agenda.\n\nIn a 12 October preliminary legal assessment condemning Hamas's attacks in Israel, international humanitarian law scholar and Dean of Cornell Law School Jens David Ohlin said the evidence suggested Hamas's \"killings and kidnappings\" potentially violated Articles 6\u20138 of the Rome Statute as well as the Genocide Convention and were \"crimes against humanity\"; over a hundred international scholars expressed support for this position.\nSexual and gender-based violence\nMain article: Sexual and gender-based violence in the 7 October attack on Israel\n\nDuring the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities, Israeli women and girls were reportedly raped, assaulted, and mutilated by Hamas militants, an allegation that Hamas denies. In the months following the attacks, The Wall Street Journal reported on 21 December, there was \"mounting evidence of sexual violence, based on survivor accounts, first responders and witnesses.\" A two-month New York Times investigation, released in late December 2023, found at least seven locations where sexual assaults and mutilations of Israeli women and girls were carried out. It concluded that these were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence during the 7 October massacres. The probe was based on video footage, photographs, GPS data from mobile phones and interviews with more than 150 people. The newspaper's probe concluded that Hamas \"weaponized sexual violence\" during the attacks. Israeli police said dozens of women and some men were raped. The New York Times reported that \"videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers.\"\n\nThese acts were denounced as gender-based violence, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, aligning with the International Criminal Court's recognition of sexual violence as such."]}, {"query": "Which government, between Israel and Hamas, allowed approximately 18,000 Palestinian laborers from Gaza to work in Israel over recent years, and facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars from Qatar to Gaza, despite concerns about potential security risks and diversion of funds to acquire weapons and rockets?", "response": "Israel", "contexts": ["Both governments have been criticized for having championed a policy of empowering the Hamas government in Gaza by, for instance, granting work permits to Gazan residents, facilitating the transfer of funds to Hamas and maintaining relative calm. By the conclusion of Netanyahu's fifth government in 2021, the issuance of work permits to Gazans reached approximately 2,000-3,000; however, under the Bennett-Lapid government, this number significantly increased to 10,000. More recently, another 8,000 permits have been granted to West Bank residents under Israel's Unity Government for agricultural work, despite concerns about their vetting and potential security risks. In total, Israel has allowed up to 18,000 Palestinian laborers from Gaza to work in Israel over recent years. In addition to granting workers permits, millions of dollars from Qatar have been transported into Gaza, escorted by Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, intended for Gaza's power plant, infrastructure projects and monthly stipends for impoverished Palestinian families, while Israeli officials were aware that Hamas might divert the funds to acquire weapons and rockets.\n\nThese strategies towards Hamas have been criticized as having backfired in light of the attacks on 7 October 2023. Critics, including human-rights activists and aid organizations, cautioned that such policies may have prolonged Hamas's power in Gaza while weakening Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank thus sabotaging a two-state solution. This criticism has been echoed by several Israeli officials, including former prime minister Ehud Barak and former head of the Shin Bet internal security service Yuval Diskin. The Palestinian Authority and Saudi Arabia were also critical of Netanyahu's government allowing Qatar to deliver suitcases of money to Hamas in exchange for maintaining the ceasefire. A Times of Israel op-ed argued after the Hamas attack that Netanyahu's policy to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset had \"blown up in our faces\". Netanyahu himself has criticized opinions on his responsibility for the 7 October attacks, stating \"Did people ask Franklin Roosevelt, after Pearl Harbor, that question? Did people ask George Bush after the surprise attack of November [sic] 11?\" referring to the 11 September 2001 terror attacks.\n\nNumerous commentators have identified the broader context of Israeli occupation as a cause of the war. The Associated Press wrote that Palestinians are \"in despair over a never-ending occupation in the West Bank and suffocating blockade of Gaza.\" Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, B'Tselem and Human Rights Watch have likened the Israeli occupation to apartheid, although supporters of Israel dispute this characterization. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported roughly 6,400 Palestinians and 300 Israelis were killed in the wider Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict from 2008 through September 2023 before the start of this war.\n2023 Israeli-Palestinian escalation\nSee also: 2023 Neve Yaakov shooting, 2023 Al-Aqsa clashes, 2023 Israel\u2013Lebanon shellings, May 2023 Gaza\u2013Israel clashes, and July 2023 Jenin incursion\n\nOver the course of 2023, before the attack, 39 Israelis and two foreign nationals had been killed, 116 wounded in Palestinian attacks, while at least 247 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli forces. Increases in settler attacks had displaced hundreds of Palestinians, and there were clashes around the Al-Aqsa Mosque which sits on the Temple Mount, a contested holy site in Jerusalem.\n\nIn August 2023, 1,264 Palestinians were held in administrative detention in Israel, without charge or trial, the highest number in three decades. Israel says this tactic is necessary to contain dangerous militants.\n\nTensions between Israel and Hamas rose in September 2023, and the Washington Post described the two \"on the brink of war\". Israel found explosives hidden in a shipment of jeans and halted all exports from Gaza. In response, Hamas put its forces on high alert, and conducted military exercises with other groups, including openly practicing storming Israeli settlements. Hamas also allowed Palestinians to resume protests at the Gaza\u2013Israel barrier. On 13 September, five Palestinians were killed at the border. According to the Washington Post, the Palestinians were attempting to detonate an explosive device. Al-Jazeera reported that a Palestinian Explosives Engineering Unit was working to deactivate the device. On 29 September, Qatar, the UN, and Egypt mediated an agreement between Israel and Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip to reopen closed crossing points and deescalate tensions.", "The US, UK and other countries also engaged in conflict with the Yemeni Houthi movement, after Houthis attacked civilian commercial ships in the Red Sea they said were linked to Israel.\nBackground\nSee also: Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Gaza\u2013Israel conflict, and Israeli-occupied territories\nRockets fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip, 2001\u20132021\nA bar chart from 2008 to before October 2023. 6,407 Palestinians have been killed during this time frame, while a smaller 308 Israelis have been killed.\nIsraeli and Palestinian deaths preceding the war before the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Most were civilians.\n\nIsrael occupied the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, in 1967. In 1987, the First Intifada, a popular uprising by the Palestinians against the Israeli occupation, began. The conflict lasted five years and ended with the Oslo Accords, creating the Palestinian National Authority and dividing the West Bank into three administrative areas. Following the failure of the subsequent peace talks at the Camp David Summits in 2000, violence once again escalated during the Second Intifada, which ended with the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit and Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and subsequent blockade.\n\nHamas, an Islamist militant group, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and a subsequent battle in the Gaza Strip between it and Fatah, which led to it taking over governance in the strip, and further escalating tensions with Israel. Israel, along with Egypt, imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza's economy, citing security concerns as the justification. International rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment, while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory.\n\nSince the blockade, Israel and Palestinian militants have had several clashes and made attacks on each other. The Palestinian Authority has not held national elections since 2006. Hamas tunneled under the border wall to launch cross-border attacks and fired rockets into Israeli territory. This led to multiple conflicts, escalating into outright wars. Israel relied on the Iron Dome rocket defense system for defense, and responded with targeted strikes into Gaza, aiming to minimize the militant threat. Surveys in 2023 of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank before the war indicated that a majority supported the use of \"armed struggle\", the creation of \"militant groups\", and an intifada (\"uprising\") against the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe Gaza Strip's economy declined greatly due to the blockade, with a 30% drop in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) within a year. By 2015, the unemployment rate had risen to 45% (compared to the pre-blockade level of 10%). In 2023, UNRWA statistics for Gaza reported 81% of people living below the poverty level, and 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance. According to UNICEF, \"Israel only approves 64%\" of patients' requests to leave Gaza for specialized medical treatment. According to an analysis in The Independent, the Gaza blockade created hopelessness among Palestinians, which was exploited by Hamas, convincing young Palestinian men that violence was their only solution. Daoud Kuttab wrote that Palestinian attempts to solve the conflict via negotiations or non-violent boycotts have been fruitless.\n\nHamas is designated as a terrorist entity by the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, the European Union, and others. Other UNSC permanent members China and Russia have not done so. A 2018 attempt to condemn Hamas for \"acts of terror\" at the United Nations failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority, with 87 votes in favor, 58 votes against, 32 abstentions and 16 non-votes. The UN Israeli Ambassador at the time criticized the procedure, stating the vote had been \"hijacked\" due to a change in procedure requiring a two-thirds majority instead of a simple majority which would have passed the motion.\n\nIn February\u2013March 2021, Fatah and Hamas reached agreement to jointly conduct elections for a new Palestinian legislative assembly, in accordance with the Oslo Accords. Hamas committed to upholding international law, transferring control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Mahmoud Abbas subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States. Soon after the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis exploded, the Al-Qassam Brigades started planning the operation which would break out on 7 October 2023."]}, {"query": "Which historians criticized the historical accuracy of Ridley Scott's film \"Napoleon\" and what specific inaccuracies did they point out?", "response": "\nSeveral historians criticized the historical accuracy of Ridley Scott's film \"Napoleon,\" including:\n\n1.

Roberts, a Napoleon biographer, said his portrayal as a proto-Hitler was \"as tired as it is absurd\". Historian Zack White agreed, saying the film mirrored contemporary British propaganda denigrating Napoleon as a \"Corsican ruffian\". Ellin Stein, writing for Slate, pointed out that Napoleon was known for his passion for literature and Enlightenment thought \u2013 a far cry from the boorish, loutish soldier that Scott depicts.

Spanish historian Francisco Gracia Alonso called the film \"a crime\". Historian Joan Tumblety wrote that the movie ignored relevant historical atrocities such as the Siege of Jaffa.\n\nContrary to the film, Napoleon did not attend the execution of Marie Antoinette, as he was commanding forces at Toulon at the time. The movie additionally depicts a defeated Napoleon meeting Wellington, whereas in actuality, the two men never met. Oxford historian Michael Broers, who worked on the movie, noted several inaccuracies in Napoleon and Josephine's relationship, including the timing of their divorce (1809, not 1807), its nature (Napoleon did not slap Josephine during their divorce), and its rationale (Josephine is portrayed as encouraging the divorce, whereas in reality, she was fearful of it). The historical Josephine also died the day before Napoleon's exile to Elba, not a year later during the Hundred Days, and thus was not a factor in Napoleon's return.\n\nThe film presents Napoleon as firing on the Pyramids of Giza, which never happened. Cairo egyptologist Salima Ikram pointed out that Napoleon held the Sphinx and the pyramids in high esteem and used them as motivation for his troops. \"He definitely did not take pot shots at them.\" In an interview with The Times, Scott defended his depiction of the attack on the pyramids as being \"a fast way of saying [Napoleon] took Egypt.\"\n\nMajor events of Napoleon's reign such as the Peninsular War, the Saint-Domingue expedition, the Austrian campaign of 1809 and the campaigns of 1813 and 1814 are entirely omitted. The film's depiction of the battle of Waterloo silences the roles of Dutch and German armies. Napoleon's field marshals, who played a key role in his campaigns, are almost absent from the movie.\n\nHistorian Paul du Quenoy criticized the depiction of Napoleonic era battlefield tactics, especially the Austerlitz sequence, \"one of the few battles that the film depicts in detail.\" He noted that historians consider the ambush on the ice to be myth of the Austerlitz campaign, \"a minor detail whose significance has been doubted almost since the time of the battle.\" Napoleon, an artillery officer by training, never personally led a cavalry charge, as is shown at Borodino and Waterloo. Franz-Stefan Gady, writing for Foreign Policy, described the battle sequences as \"a Hollywood mishmash of medieval melees, meaningless cannonades, and World War I-style infantry advances.\" \"For all of Scott\u2019s fixation on Napoleon\u2019s battles, he seems curiously disinterested in how the real Napoleon fought them.\"\n\nScott dismissed criticisms of the film's historical inaccuracies. \"Napoleon dies then, ten years later, someone writes a book.

Prior intrusions did not result in an eruption. Volcanic unrest on the peninsula during this period had mostly been associated with the Fagradalsfjall system, where three out of four confirmed magmatic intrusions culminated in volcanic eruptions.\n\nAlthough earthquakes are a frequent occurrence in Iceland due to the island's location, straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, the recent swarm was noted for being more extensive than usual.

The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management deployed the Icelandic Coast Guard Vessel \u00de\u00f3r to the area \"for safety purposes\". It also closed all roads to Grindav\u00edk except for emergency and evacuation purposes. On 13 November, authorities allowed residents to return briefly to the town to retrieve their belongings. Boat owners were also allowed to remove their vessels from the harbour. The Icelandic government is seeking to accommodate displaced residents in holiday homes and little-used properties while the emergency continues.

Later that year, Revolutionary leader Paul Barras has Napoleon manage the Siege of Toulon; he successfully storms the city and repels the British ships with artillery. After Maximilien Robespierre is deposed and executed at the end of the Reign of Terror, French leaders, including Napoleon, attempt to restore stability.

Despite their vigorous sex life, they bear no children. In Egypt, he prevails again at the Battle of the Pyramids in 1798, but rushes home when he hears Jos\u00e9phine has an almost 10-year younger lover, Hippolyte Charles. The Directory criticises him for abandoning his troops, but he condemns them for their poor leadership of France and, alongside several collaborators such as Talleyrand, Fouch\u00e9, Siey\u00e8s and Ducos, overthrows them in a coup and becomes First Consul.\n\nNapoleon is crowned Emperor of the French by the pope in 1804, during which he audaciously puts the crown on his own head. Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggests to Austria an alliance, though the Austrians dismiss the idea. A year later, Napoleon outmanoeuvres and defeats the Austrians and Russians at the Battle of Austerlitz, forcing them to retreat over frozen lakes before bombarding the ice and drowning them. Afterwards, he invites Austrian Emperor Francis II for wine\u2014which Russian Tsar Alexander I declines to attend\u2014and tells Francis that since he did not totally destroy their armies, he expects the latter to be grateful.\n\nNapoleon's mother has him impregnate a mistress, proving that Jos\u00e9phine is infertile.

The fire was described as one of \"rapid advance and high intensity\", and caused the interruption of vehicular traffic on Routes 68 and F-718.[23] Another fire was reported in Lo Moscoso at 3:54 p.m., affecting 8 hectares (20 acres) in the communes of Quilpu\u00e9 and Villa Alemana.

At 6:00 p.m., evacuations were ordered in La Patag\u00fcilla, La Aguada, El Mait\u00e9n, and San Rafael. On 2 February, Senapred called for urgent evacuation from San Miguel de Viluco and Pihuelo.[26]\n\nBy 2 February, the situation escalated significantly, leading Senapred to declare a Red Alert for the entire region, indicating greater severity of the fires and the need to mobilize all available resources for their suppression. Due to the severity of the forest fire in La Estrella, Senapred ordered the evacuation of the La Puntilla sector.[27] At 2:00 p.m. evacuation orders were extended to other sectors of the commune.[28][29][30][31] At 6:00 p.m., the evacuation of Pumanque commune was ordered.[32] At 7:00 p.m., other sectors of La Estrella were ordered evacuated.[33] By 6:00 p.m. it was reported that 3,455 hectares (8,540 acres) had been destroyed by the fires.[34]\nMaule Region\n\nOn 1 February, authorities issued a Yellow Alert for the communes of Pencahue and Curepto.

This decision was driven by the expansion of the \"Hijuela 3 Las Palmas\" fire to 850 hectares (2,100 acres) and its extreme behavior, which included the emission of sparks and proximity to populated areas, which represented a significant risk for local communities.[35] During the same day, in response to the \"Santa Laura\" forest fire in the commune of Curic\u00f3 reported at 5:54 p.m. and which initially covered 5 hectares (12 acres), Senapred declared a Yellow Alert for the commune. At 5:00 p.m, sectors of Curic\u00f3 were ordered to evacuate.[36][37] At 19:19, in response to the growth of the fire to 20 hectares (49 acres), the Yellow Alert was upgraded to a Red Alert. This led to the mobilization all available resources for its control, including the additional deployment of Conaf brigades, aircraft and the participation of the Carabineros de Chile to assist in the evacuation of the affected areas. At 10:39 p.m., the \"Santa Laura\" fire was declared \"controlled\" after affecting 30 hectares (74 acres), and prompted the downgrading of the Red Alert to Yellow by Senapred and Conaf, indicating that, although the immediate threat had been overcome, resources would remain on alert to respond to any change in conditions.[38]\n\nAt 10:50 p.m., a red alert was declared in the commune of Huala\u00f1\u00e9, affecting 120 hectares (300 acres)."]}, {"query": "Which international news organizations sent a letter to Israel and Egypt requesting access to cover the war in Gaza in November 2021?", "response": "\n\nA letter signed by 24 international news organizations, including Reuters, AFP, AP, BBC, CNN, Fox News, NBC, and Sky News, was sent to Israel and Egypt on 11 November 2021, requesting permission to enter Gaza to cover the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.", "contexts": ["On 29 December, South Africa submitted a case to the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza and requested provisional measures for Israel to suspend its military campaign in Gaza. In its filing, South Africa alleged that Israel's actions were \"intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.\" On 2 January 2024, Israel decided to appear before the ICJ in response to the case made by South Africa. The Court issued an Order in relation to the provisional measures request on 26 January 2024 in which it ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts that could be considered genocidal but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. It determined that it was \"plausible\" that some of Israel's actions may violate the Genocide Convention. The final ruling is expected to take years.\nSiege of Gaza\nSee also: Siege of Gaza City and Urban warfare\nIsraeli soldiers operating in a ruined Gazan neighborhood\n\nIsrael imposed a \"complete siege\" on Gaza in the first ten days of the war, due to security concerns that weapons, fuel and armaments would be transferred to Hamas in the guise of humanitarian aid. Israel later allowed the delivery of limited humanitarian aid following security checks. Israel's restriction of the flow of food, fuel, water and other humanitarian aid was criticized as a war crime by human rights organizations.\n\nTom Dannenbaum, co-director of the Center for International Law & Governance at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, wrote that the order \"commands the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime.\" Oxfam issued a statement that accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war, saying \"International Humanitarian Law (IHL) strictly prohibits the use of starvation as a method of warfare and as the occupying power in Gaza, Israel is bound by IHL obligations to provide for the needs and protection of the population of Gaza\".\n\nGeoffrey S. Corn, Chair of Criminal Law and Director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, and Sean Watts, professor in the Department of Law at the United States Military Academy at West Point, write that sieges are subject to the same laws of war as other military tactics such as distinction and proportionality. Watts previously wrote that Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention \"requires that parties to a conflict allow passage of a limited class of relief supplies for civilians...only if the parties are satisfied no advantage will result 'to the military efforts or economy of the enemy'\", but that if the law is interpreted to allow \"incidental\" starvation of civilians proportional to anticipated military advantage, it \"reduces the rule's humanitarian effect, perhaps to the vanishing point.\"\n\nAmnesty International called for an urgent investigation into Israel's mass detentions and the enforced disappearance of Palestinians in Gaza, noting that the disappearances and treatment of captives could amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity.\nProportionality and distinction\n\nIt has been debated whether Israel is respecting the principles of discrimination and proportionality as required under the laws of war. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has stated that the overall civilian death toll, and Israel's use of powerful weapons in Gaza's densely-populated neighbourhoods, raised \"serious questions\" about the legality of Israel's conduct. HRW further argued that a higher proportion of casualties among women and children is indicative of a lack of proportionality, demonstrating what they describe as \"a disregard toward Palestinian lives\". United Nations officials and human rights groups have argued that Israel has not done enough to protect civilians.\n\nEmanuela-Chiara Gillard, an associate fellow at Chatham House, argued that, given the size and nature of the 7 October attacks, Israel has a right of self-defence that could include its stated military aim of destroying Hamas, which has threatened to repeat its assault and eradicate the state of Israel. According to The Economist, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and international humanitarian law (IHL) grant Israel flexibility when it comes to taking military action against Hamas, but in its view, Israel's \"definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point.\"\n\nAmichai Cohen, an Israeli lawyer, alleges that Israel does not deliberately target civilians but that Hamas's tactics make it hard to take action without affecting civilians. Jill Goldenziel, a professor at the United States National Defense University and Marine Corps University, states that if Israel conducted every strike legally and with utmost precision, civilian casualties in war would still remain, and the goal of a proportionality analysis is to decide whether they are excessive. Israeli security officials state that their proportionality criteria in this conflict are unchanged and that they receive legal advice in relation to strikes.", "On 9 November, Israel agreed to daily four-hour \"humanitarian pauses\" to allow civilians to obtain food and medicine, as well as evacuate to the south. Evacuees described the evacuation path as full of death and horror. Jan Egeland, the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said on 5 December that \"The pulverising of Gaza now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age.

Based on the story of Napoleon Bonaparte and primarily depicting his rise to power as well as his relationship with his wife, Jos\u00e9phine Bonaparte, it stars Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon and Vanessa Kirby as Jos\u00e9phine.\n\nIn October 2020, Scott announced Napoleon as his next project. Following delays and recastings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, filming began in February 2022 in England, lasting several months. In addition to writer David Scarpa, frequent Scott collaborators included cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and editor Claire Simpson.\n\nNapoleon premiered at Salle Pleyel in Paris on November 14, 2023, and was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on November 22, 2023, by Sony Pictures Releasing, before streaming on Apple TV+ at a later date. The film has grossed $219 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the battle sequences and performances, though it was criticized for its historical inaccuracies. At the 96th Academy Awards, the film received nominations for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Visual Effects.\nPlot\n\nIn 1793, amid the French Revolution, young army officer Napoleon Bonaparte watches Marie Antoinette beheaded by the guillotine. Later that year, Revolutionary leader Paul Barras has Napoleon manage the Siege of Toulon; he successfully storms the city and repels the British ships with artillery. After Maximilien Robespierre is deposed and executed at the end of the Reign of Terror, French leaders, including Napoleon, attempt to restore stability. Again employing artillery, Napoleon suppresses the royalist insurrection on 13 Vend\u00e9miaire in 1795.\n\nNapoleon woos aristocratic widow Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais and the two eventually marry. Despite their vigorous sex life, they bear no children. In Egypt, he prevails again at the Battle of the Pyramids in 1798, but rushes home when he hears Jos\u00e9phine has an almost 10-year younger lover, Hippolyte Charles. The Directory criticises him for abandoning his troops, but he condemns them for their poor leadership of France and, alongside several collaborators such as Talleyrand, Fouch\u00e9, Siey\u00e8s and Ducos, overthrows them in a coup and becomes First Consul.\n\nNapoleon is crowned Emperor of the French by the pope in 1804, during which he audaciously puts the crown on his own head. Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggests to Austria an alliance, though the Austrians dismiss the idea. A year later, Napoleon outmanoeuvres and defeats the Austrians and Russians at the Battle of Austerlitz, forcing them to retreat over frozen lakes before bombarding the ice and drowning them. Afterwards, he invites Austrian Emperor Francis II for wine\u2014which Russian Tsar Alexander I declines to attend\u2014and tells Francis that since he did not totally destroy their armies, he expects the latter to be grateful.\n\nNapoleon's mother has him impregnate a mistress, proving that Jos\u00e9phine is infertile. He divorces her in 1810, publicly slapping her in the face when she initially refuses to read her portion of the decree, but the two remain on good terms and continue exchanging friendly letters. Napoleon marries Marie Louise of Austria, who bears a son one year later.\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon invades Russia after Alexander reneges on a peace treaty with France. He prevails, despite bloody guerrilla resistance by Don Cossack forces, at the Battle of Borodino, but finds Moscow empty and later set aflame. Napoleon retreats during the winter to France, having lost about half a million men. In 1814, the Coalition force Napoleon's abdication and exile him to Elba.\n\nIn 1815, upon hearing that Jos\u00e9phine is unwell, Napoleon escapes the island and returns to power in France. She, having been forced into reclusion at the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison, dies before he arrives. King Louis XVIII sends the Fifth Regiment to stop Napoleon, but he charms them into joining him.\n\nAt the Battle of Waterloo in June, Napoleon, having amassed more troops, confronts the British army under the Duke of Wellington. French cavalry charges are repulsed by British infantry squares, and a desperate Napoleon urges his remaining soldiers forward, but this advance is decimated by re-formed lines of enemy infantry.

He would direct and produce, while the screenplay was written by Scott's All the Money in the World (2017) collaborator David Scarpa. The film's working title was derived from the saying that \"There is a general's staff hidden in every soldier's kitbag\". During the same year, Scott also consulted with University of Oxford scholar Michael Broers regarding Napoleon's life, particularly collaborating with him in deconstructing the geography of the Battle of Waterloo. He also received Stanley Kubrick's script for his planned Napoleon film, which never materialized. By January 2021, Apple Studios announced its commitment to finance and produce the film, with filming scheduled to begin in the United Kingdom in 2022.\nWriting\n\nScarpa had been approached by Scott to write a film based on Napoleon following production of All the Money in the World. As he initially had a \"high school basic knowledge\" of his life, he conducted research regarding Napoleon and after realizing that writing a film encompassing his entire life was impractical, he decided to focus on Napoleon's relationship with his wife, Josephine. He began by reading Napoleon: A Concise Biography by David A. Bell, but did not understand it and opted to conduct further research by reading more books and watching YouTube videos. When researching Josephine, he cited Ambition and Desire: The Dangerous Life of Josephine Bonaparte by Kate Williams as his primary influence. He took inspiration from Scott's The Duellist (1977) and Milos Forman's Amadeus (1984), wanting to portray Napoleon as an \"irreverent\" figure similar to how Mozart was depicted in Amadeus, and told Scott he envisioned Napoleon as being competent \"in the realm of battle\", and \"incompetent in the realm of love\". Scott proposed the idea of beginning the film with Marie Antoinette being under the guillotine, wanting to focus on the \"ambivalence about where democracy leads\". Scott's writing process also involved hand-drawing storyboards, with him sending Scarpa the illustrations once Scarpa sent him pages from the script.\nCasting\n\nJoaquin Phoenix was reportedly attached to star as the French general and emperor Napol\u00e9on, reuniting him with the director after Gladiator (2000). Scott had Phoenix and another actor he has refused to reveal in mind to play Napole\u00f3n, but felt \"blown away\" by Phoenix's performance in Joker (2019) and concluded that Phoenix could be an \"amazing asset\" for Napoleon, both creatively and commercially.\n\nThe Last Duel actress Jodie Comer was reportedly Scott's first choice to play Jos\u00e9phine. She entered negotiations to star in March 2021, confirmed her casting in September, and said: \"I just jumped at the chance to work with Ridley and his team again and the idea of working with Joaquin, who's someone who I hugely admire... I'm so excited to delve into that world.\" In November, she said her role was \"going to be another huge challenge, but what I love about period dramas is that kind of transformation. Even now, doing some costume and hair tests for Kitbag, it's just so exciting because it becomes so much easier to step out of yourself and into somebody else.\" The same month, Youssef Kerkour was confirmed to star. On January 4, 2022, Comer revealed her departure from the film due to scheduling changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Vanessa Kirby was announced as her replacement later that day. On January 18, 2022, producer Kevin J. Walsh said the film had been retitled Napoleon. In February, Tahar Rahim was added to the cast, in the role of Paul Barras.

Knesset\nCourt\tSupreme Court of Israel\nStarted\tSeptember 12, 2023\nDecided\tJanuary 1, 2024\nCitation(s)\tHCJ 5658/23\nCourt membership\nJudges sitting\tEsther Hayut\nUzi Vogelman\nYitzhak Amit\nNoam Sohlberg\nDaphne Barak-Erez\nAnat Baron\nDavid Mintz\nYosef Elron\nYael Willner\nOfer Grosskopf\nAlex Stein\nGila Canfy-Steinitz\nKhaled Kabub\nYechiel Kasher\nRuth Ronnen\nCase opinions\nConcurrence\t8\nDissent\t7\n\nOn 12 September 2023, for the first time in its history, the court heard the case with all 15 justices sitting. At the end of December 2023, Israeli television station Keshet 12 reported the ruling in advance based on a leaked draft of the decision. The bill was struck down by the Supreme Court, in its role as the High Court of Justice, on 1 January 2024 by a vote of 8\u20137. The justices also ruled 12\u20133 that the court has the power to overturn Basic Laws.\n\nEach justice wrote their own opinion. Justice Hayut noted Israel's \"fragile, lacking system of checks and balances\" in finding that the reform was unreasonable; Amit echoed the \"heavy democratic deficit in Israel\", saying that \"such a cancellation of the reasonableness doctrine has much greater weight here than in other countries\". Justice Stein agreed in upholding the court's ability to strike down laws, writing that \"the Knesset never received the authority to pass any law it pleased\", but voted with the minority in favor of the proposed reform, finding that it \"violates no constitutional norm\". Sohlberg, meanwhile, wrote that \"frail legal constructs\" did not mean the court could overrule the Knesset.\nProposed changes\nJudicial selection\nCurrent system\n\nThe Judicial Selection Committee is composed of nine members. Three of them are Supreme Court judges, two are representatives of the Bar Association, two are Knesset members and two are ministers. Selection of judges to all courts require a simple majority of the committee, but selection of Supreme Court judges require the approval of seven out of the nine members on the committee, granting essentially veto powers to either the three judges or the representatives of the ruling Parliamentary coalition.\n\nAccording to the Israel Democracy Institute, the effect of the current system is one of consensus, in that \"the selection of Supreme Court justices has mandated the consent of the politicians on the [Committee], because a majority of seven of its nine members must support a successful candidate. By the same token, the politicians cannot select judges without the agreement of the justices on the committee. This principle has generally produced a consensus on a slate of new justices.\"", "By doing so, it would severely curtail the Supreme Court's authority of constitutional review of laws passed by the Knesset, which is controlled by the Government (the executive branch) that enjoys a political majority. Every country has checks and balances that set limits on the power of the political majority. In Israel, however, the Supreme Court is the sole balancing mechanism.\"\nAbolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\nArguments in favor of the reform\n\nThe reform will abolish the use of \"unreasonableness\" as grounds for review of administrative decisions. Although unreasonableness has its origins in British jurisprudence, the court has expanded on this doctrine since Israel's founding in 1948. Some have claimed that the courts' definition of the grounds of reasonableness is unique globally. An unreasonable administrative action has been defined as a situation in which the administrative authority failed to give proper weight to all relevant considerations which formed the basis of the administrative decision, and did not properly balance between all the relevant considerations, in accordance with their weight:\n\n    The only way to further the discussion about the substance of reasonableness is to recognize that reasonableness is neither a physical nor a metaphysical concept, but a normative one. Reasonableness means that one identifies the relevant considerations and then balances them according to their weight. Indeed, reasonableness is an evaluative process, not a descriptive process. It is not a concept that is defined by deductive logic. It is not merely rationality. A decision is reasonable if it was made by weighing the necessary considerations, including fundamental values in general and human rights in particular. Nothing is reasonable 'in itself'.\n\nThis expansive doctrine empowers the Supreme Court to strike down almost any administrative decision, even if it was taken by due legal authority. In an interview with Haaretz, former Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau criticized the use of the \"unreasonableness\" doctrine:\n\n    The justices in the older court did not set themselves up as the teachers of the generation. We did not think that our task was to teach the public fundamental or deep values of private or public morality. This doesn't mean that we didn't pay attention to values. This doesn't mean that we didn't make value judgements. But we understood the limitations of the Court's jurisdiction. We made sure that what we ruled on regarding values flowed out of the issue brought before us [...] The judge is not the teacher of the generation and is not a philosopher-king. His task is much more modest: to be a faithful interpreter of the law. Of the public's will as expressed by the Knesset, as representative of the public. Therefore, I believe that the judge's wisdom requires him to be cautious, sensitive, with broad discretion and without hubris.\n\nArguments against the reform\n\nAmir Fuchs, a lecturer in the Politics and Communication Department at the School of Government and Social Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, has argued in favor of the reasonableness doctrine, saying that \"its purpose is to prevent the government from passing entirely arbitrary decisions; but it is certainly not intended to replace the decision-making powers of the government, with those of the court. Like all other administrative law standards (the rules of natural justice, and standards such as the ban on extraneous interests and the requirement to take all relevant considerations into account), it is meant to ensure that the government does not exceed the boundaries of its law-given authority.\"\n\nYedidia Stern, former dean of the Law Faculty at Bar Ilan University, has defended the reasonableness doctrine, stating that without it, \"the members of the outgoing Knesset will have the power to make the final decision about who can run against them in the next election. Without judicial review they will be able to protect one another through the mechanism of parliamentary immunity.\"\n\nRuvi Ziegler, the programme director for Master of Laws in International Law, Human Rights and Advanced Legal Studies at the University of Reading, has written that \"the plan would strip courts of their power to hold the Executive properly accountable for its administrative decisions. This means decisions made by public authorities from the police to the tax authority, would no longer need to be considered \"reasonable\" to be accepted in judicial review. In practical terms this means anyone could be denied a license, a benefit, a service without being given suitable reasons and without having an effective remedy. The \"reasonableness\" standard, which is a key part of British legal heritage, is critical for good governance and must be maintained in the Israeli setting as well.\""]}, {"query": "Which international organizations issued statements expressing concern for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza during the first month of the war and called for more action in October 2024?", "response": "\nThe following international organizations issued statements expressing concern for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza during the first month of the war and called for more action in October 2024:\n\n1.

South Korea condemned Hamas and called Hamas's attack \"indiscriminate\"; expressed worries that despite missile interceptor defense systems it would remain vulnerable if North Korea attempted a similar attack on South Korea. Most Latin American governments condemned Hamas's attacks in Israel, while some, such as Colombia, expressed solidarity with Palestinians. The European Union announced it would review aid to Palestinian authorities to ensure the aid was not funding terrorism, and subsequently announced that immediate humanitarian aid to Gaza would be tripled.\n\nAustria, Germany, and Sweden suspended development aid to Palestine in response to Hamas's attack and said that they would review other projects and aid given. Germany sent two Heron TP drones to Israel. On 8 November 2023, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs announced that the German government had authorized a tenfold increase in arms exports to Israel; the export of military equipment to Israel would be treated and approved as a priority. Exports worth around 32 million euros in all of 2022 rose to almost 303 million euros in 2023, most of which was authorized after the start of the war. Heads of the World Uyghur Congress and the Uyghur Human Rights Project condemned Hamas while East Turkistan Government-in-Exile minister Salih Hudayar declared support for Israel. Croatia's president Zoran Milanovi\u0107 publicly stated that Israel had lost his sympathy due to its humanitarian crimes and \"reprisal actions\" in Gaza. Colombian president Gustavo Petro likened IDF attacks against Palestinians to Nazis and asked the Israeli ambassador to \"apologize and leave the country\". Spain's deputy prime minister Yolanda D\u00edaz called on the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop what she called a massacre in Gaza. On multiple occasions, Pope Francis referred to Israel's actions in Gaza as \"terror\" and \"terrorism\".\n\nResponses from African governments varied, showing division about the source of the conflict and who is to blame. However, most expressed grief and deep concerns about the outbreak of violence, with condemnations of attacks against civilians and calls for restraint and de-escalation to prevent further loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives.\n\nAs many as 20,000 Thai workers (around half of Israel's migrant work force) live all over Israel, including areas close to Gaza. Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said their stance towards \"the deadly Hamas-led attack against Israel is one of neutrality, and the Kingdom promotes a solution that would allow Palestine and Israel to coexist\".\n\nQueen Rania of Jordan said leaders of Western countries had double standards and were \"complicit\" in civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\nA summit in Amman hosted by King Abdullah II that was also to be attended by leaders of the Palestinian Authority, US and Egypt was cancelled by Jordan on 18 October, in response to the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion. On the same day, China said Palestinians had been forced to move south because of Israel's evacuation order \"only to suffer from air strikes in the south as well\" and called the hospital explosion a \"heinous attack\" while Russia labeled the explosion as a war crime, saying that the US was ultimately responsible.\n\nOn 31 October, Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Israel due to what the deputy foreign minister called \"the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive\". Several other countries followed suit in severing relations with Israel.", "Ambassador recalls\n\nOn the afternoon of Israel's 31 October airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp, Bolivia severed all diplomatic ties with Israel, followed by a series of ambassador recalls by Chile and Colombia hours later, Jordan on 1 November, Bahrain on 2 November, Honduras on 3 November, Turkey on 4 November, Chad on 5 November, South Africa on 6 November, and Belize on 14 November. Bolivia's minister of the presidency demanded an end to the attacks on the Gaza Strip, while Chilean President Gabriel Boric cited Israel's \"collective punishment of the Palestinian civilian population\" and Columbian President Gustavo Petro cited the \"massacre of the Palestinian people\". Jordan's Foreign Minister cited an \"unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe\" and condemned the \"Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza\". Bahrain's National Assembly additionally cut off all economic relations, citing a \"solid and historical stance that supports the Palestinian cause and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\" This decision does not appear to have been implemented. Honduras' Minister of Foreign Affairs cited Israel's violations of international humanitarian law. Turkey cited \"the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians, and Israel's refusal (to accept) a ceasefire\". Turkey was criticized for still maintaining economic and military relations with Israel. Chad cited the \"unprecedented tide of deadly violence.\" South Africa recalled its entire diplomatic mission and criticized Israel's ambassador for disparaging those \"opposing the atrocities and genocide of the Israeli government\". Belize suspended diplomatic relations with Israel, citing the \"unceasing, indiscriminate bombing in Gaza\" and its violations of international humanitarian law.\nWillingness to take refugees by third countries\n\nBoth Jordan and Egypt have rejected the idea of hosting Palestinian refugees fleeing from Gaza, with King Abdullah II of Jordan warning against pushing Palestinians to seek refuge in Jordan, and emphasizing the need to address the humanitarian situation within Gaza and the West Bank. Both countries have expressed serious concern that Israel may seek to permanently expel Palestinians, a statement that Israel disputes. On 2 November, however, Egypt said it will help around 7,000 foreigners and Palestinians with dual-nationalities through the Rafah Border Crossing.\n\nScotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf who has family in Gaza, urged the international community to establish a refugee program for those fleeing violence in Gaza and said that Scotland was ready to offer sanctuary to refugees arriving in the UK. European countries are wary of a refugee influx due to recent pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nIn the United States, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested that the problem of refugees be solved by \"the region's partners\", but emphasized the \"historical role\" of the US in accepting refugees, while Representative Jamaal Bowman said that the US should welcome refugees who are not affiliated with Hamas.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a 40-page report which criticised Baloch nationalists of killing, threatening and harassing teachers. Human Right Watch (HRW) has also held separatist responsible for attacks on schools across the province. Another factor which limits the scope of nationalist insurgency is the lack of support from locals as majority of locals don't support separatist groups. Locals support political parties who use legislature to address their grievances.\nHuman rights issues\nMain article: Human rights violations in Balochistan\n\nHuman Right Organisations have held Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) responsible for ethnic cleansing in the province as Brahamdagh Bugti (alleged leader of BLA), during a TV interview on 15 April 2009, urged separatists to kill non-Baloch residing in Balochistan. His actions allegedly lead to the death of 500 non-Baloch citizens in the province. According to The Economist around 800 non-Baloch settlers and Baloch have been killed by Baloch militant groups since 2006. Similarly, Human Right Watch have also held Baloch militants groups like Baloch liberation army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation United Front (BLUF) to be responsible for attacks on schools, teachers and students in the province. As a result, many teachers have sought transfer to secure areas such as Quetta or have moved out of province entirely. Separatist militants groups have also claimed responsibility for attacking and killing Journalists in the province. Apart from Human Right Organisations, Baloch separatists themselves have accused each other of being involved in Human right violations.\n\nIn the period 2003 to 2012, it is estimated that 8000 people were abducted by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan. In 2008 alone, more than 1100 Baloch people disappeared. There have also been reports of torture. An increasing number of bodies \"with burn marks, broken limbs, nails pulled out, and sometimes with holes drilled in their heads\" are being found on roadsides as the result of a \"kill and dump\" campaign allegedly conducted by Pakistani security forces, particularly Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Frontier Corps (FC). A 2013 report from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan identified ISI and Frontier Corps as the perpetrators for many disappearances, while noting a more cooperative stance from these agencies in recent years as perceived by local police forces. The Pakistan Rangers are also alleged to have committed a vast number of human rights violations in the region. No one has been held responsible for the crimes. However, Pakistani security officials have rejected all the allegations made against them. Major General Obaid Ullah Khan claim that Baloch militants are using Frontier Corps (FC) uniform to kidnap people and malign the good name of Frontier Corps. Baloch militants have also been found using military uniform which resembles the one used by Frontier Corps while carrying out their activities. A senior Pakistani provincial security official claims that missing person figures are 'exaggerated', that 'in Balochistan, insurgents, immigrants who fled to Europe and even those who have been killed in military operations are declared as missing persons'. Reports have shown that many people have fled the province to seek asylum in other countries because of the unrest caused by separatist militants.\n\nMilitant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi have systematically targeted Shia Muslims in Balochistan, with about 600 being killed in attacks in recent years.\n\nDuring a camp at Broken Chair, Geneva, Baloch Republican Party (BRP) leader Sher Baz Bugti alleged that Baloch youth, women and children were kept in \"torture cells\". BRP chief Brahumdagh Bugti called upon human rights organisation, including the United Nations, to take steps to stop the alleged \"Baloch genocide\".\nSunni extremism and religious persecution of Zikris\n\nThe activities of terrorist organisations such as Lashkar-i-Jhangvi and Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, have produced a surge in religious extremism in Balochistan. Hindus, Shias (including Hazaras) and Zikris have been targeted, resulting in the migration of over 300,000 of them from Baluchistan.\n\nBaloch Liberation Front (BLF) and Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) have also targeted Zikris in the province.", "The US government, which has officially designated Jundallah a terrorist organisation, has denied this charge. Iran has been angered by JAA's use of Pakistani territory as a refuge, and has threatened military operations in Pakistan to counter insurgent groups \"on several occasions\".\nImpact on Iran-Pakistan Relations\nSee also: Iran\u2013Pakistan relations\nFurther information: Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar, 2024 Iranian missile strikes in Pakistan, and 2024 Iran\u2013Pakistan border skirmishes\n\nRelations between Iran and Pakistan are generally peaceful, but accusations of harboring Baloch militants have stoked distrust on both sides.\n\nIn January 2024, the Iranian and Pakistani militaries successively attacked separatist targets in border areas. Iran's missile strikes and Pakistan's operation stoke regional tensions.\nDrivers of insurgency\n\nIn Balochistan, Pakistan, \"drivers\" of insurgency have been economic, cultural, involving immigration and human rights.\n\nThe immediate reasons for joining one of the several separatist militant groups vary among militants with citing the allure of power and excitement, a desire to honor their centuries-old tribal codes, gaining recognition for their region's distinct ethnicity and even a belief in hard-line communism. Another cited reason by some is employment and funding to work as mercenaries for foreign state agencies.\nEconomic inequality\n\nEconomic inequality, and Balochistan's status as a \"neglected province where a majority of population lacks amenities\" is a dimension in the conflict. Since the mid-1970s Balochistan's share of Pakistan's GDP has dropped from 4.9 to 3.7%. Balochistan has the highest infant and maternal mortality rate, the highest poverty rate, and the lowest literacy rate in Pakistan.\n\nOn the other hand, according to a report published in the Pakistani English-language Dawn newspaper, members of Balochistan's elite society, including provincial government ministers and officials, own \"pieces of land greater in size than some small towns of the country\", and had luxury vehicles, properties, investments and businesses valued at millions of rupees.\nDevelopment issues\nGas revenue\n\nBalochistan receives less per/unit in royalties than Sindh and Punjab provinces, since Balochistan's wellhead price five times lower than in Sindh and Punjab (the gas wellhead price is based on per capita provincial income in 1953). Furthermore, the government has returned little of the royalties owed to the province, citing the need to recover operating costs. Consequently, Balochistan is heavily in debt.\n\nBalochistan Province receives Rs 32.71 per unit on gas revenues, including a royalty of Rs 13.90, excise duty of Rs 5.09, and gas development surcharge of Rs 13.72. Many private individuals with gas deposits on their land also receive payments. Many Balochs argue that such royalties are too low. In response, in 2011 Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani announced an addition of Rs. 120 billion (US$2.5 billion) to the gas development surcharge and royalty portion of the \"Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan\" package. However, royalties often do not trickle down to the common people in Balochistan due to the corruption and wealth-hoarding of Baloch tribal chiefs. This has hindered the growth of infrastructure.[citation needed]\nRegional inequality\n\nExtensive road and rail links developed by British colonialists in northern parts of Balochistan province have brought greater economic development to areas mainly inhabited by ethnic Pashtuns, which has also heightened nationalism among ethnic Balochs living in the southern parts of the within the province.\nGwadar\n\nPurchased by the government of Pakistan from Oman in 1958, the construction of the megaport of Gwadar beginning in 2002 became another source of grievances. Baloch complain that construction of the port relies on Chinese engineers and labourers, and few Balochs have been employed. A parallel town for workers at Gwadar is being built close to the old one to segregate Balochs from the growing influx of outsiders.\n\nThe Pakistani government has stationed soldiers in the area to secure it from insurgent attacks.\nMulticulturalism and immigration\n\nDue to the historical shortage of skilled labour in Balochistan, skilled workers are often imported from other regions. Their arrival means new industries can develop, boosting the local economy; however, nationalists argue that this creates resentment amongst the local inhabitants.\n\nAfter the Soviet invasion, around 4 million refugees from Afghanistan arrived and settled in the region which has resulted in substantial demographic imbalance. Perceived marginalisation as a result of increased Pashtun migration from Afghanistan during the Afghan War drives the insurgency."]}, {"query": "Which NASA Earth-observing satellite mission, managed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, was selected to be launched on a Falcon 9 by SpaceX in 2020, with a primary goal of extending key systematic ocean color, aerosol, and cloud data records for Earth system and climate studies, and a secondary goal of addressing new and emerging science questions using its advanced instruments?", "response": "PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem)", "contexts": ["Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) is a NASA Earth-observing satellite mission that will continue and advance observations of global ocean color, biogeochemistry, and ecology, as well as the carbon cycle, aerosols and clouds.

The ocean and atmosphere are directly connected, moving and transferring energy, water, nutrients, gases, aerosols, and pollutants. Aerosols, clouds, and phytoplankton can also affect one another.\n\nPACE will measure atmospheric particles and clouds that scatter and absorb sunlight. Improved characterization of aerosol particles will enable quantifying their impact on marine biology and ocean chemistry, as well as Earth's energy budget and ecological forecasting. PACE will enable scientists to better monitor fisheries, identify harmful algal blooms, and observe changes in marine resources. The color of the ocean is determined by the interaction of sunlight with substances or particles present in seawater such as chlorophyll, a green pigment found in most phytoplankton species. By monitoring global phytoplankton distribution and abundance, the mission will contribute toward understanding the complex systems that drive ocean ecology.\nScientific instruments\nPACE in the clean room\n\nThe oceans play a critical role in supporting life on Earth as well as the global economy.

Most were civilians.\n\nIsrael occupied the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, in 1967. In 1987, the First Intifada, a popular uprising by the Palestinians against the Israeli occupation, began. The conflict lasted five years and ended with the Oslo Accords, creating the Palestinian National Authority and dividing the West Bank into three administrative areas. Following the failure of the subsequent peace talks at the Camp David Summits in 2000, violence once again escalated during the Second Intifada, which ended with the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit and Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and subsequent blockade.\n\nHamas, an Islamist militant group, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and a subsequent battle in the Gaza Strip between it and Fatah, which led to it taking over governance in the strip, and further escalating tensions with Israel. Israel, along with Egypt, imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza's economy, citing security concerns as the justification. International rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment, while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory.\n\nSince the blockade, Israel and Palestinian militants have had several clashes and made attacks on each other. The Palestinian Authority has not held national elections since 2006. Hamas tunneled under the border wall to launch cross-border attacks and fired rockets into Israeli territory. This led to multiple conflicts, escalating into outright wars. Israel relied on the Iron Dome rocket defense system for defense, and responded with targeted strikes into Gaza, aiming to minimize the militant threat. Surveys in 2023 of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank before the war indicated that a majority supported the use of \"armed struggle\", the creation of \"militant groups\", and an intifada (\"uprising\") against the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe Gaza Strip's economy declined greatly due to the blockade, with a 30% drop in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) within a year. By 2015, the unemployment rate had risen to 45% (compared to the pre-blockade level of 10%). In 2023, UNRWA statistics for Gaza reported 81% of people living below the poverty level, and 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance. According to UNICEF, \"Israel only approves 64%\" of patients' requests to leave Gaza for specialized medical treatment. According to an analysis in The Independent, the Gaza blockade created hopelessness among Palestinians, which was exploited by Hamas, convincing young Palestinian men that violence was their only solution. Daoud Kuttab wrote that Palestinian attempts to solve the conflict via negotiations or non-violent boycotts have been fruitless.\n\nHamas is designated as a terrorist entity by the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, the European Union, and others. Other UNSC permanent members China and Russia have not done so. A 2018 attempt to condemn Hamas for \"acts of terror\" at the United Nations failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority, with 87 votes in favor, 58 votes against, 32 abstentions and 16 non-votes. The UN Israeli Ambassador at the time criticized the procedure, stating the vote had been \"hijacked\" due to a change in procedure requiring a two-thirds majority instead of a simple majority which would have passed the motion.\n\nIn February\u2013March 2021, Fatah and Hamas reached agreement to jointly conduct elections for a new Palestinian legislative assembly, in accordance with the Oslo Accords. Hamas committed to upholding international law, transferring control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Mahmoud Abbas subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States.

The reforms include abolishing the use of \"unreasonableness\" as grounds for review of administrative decisions, stripping courts of their power to hold the Executive properly accountable for its decisions, and giving the government authority to determine its legal position in any matter and reject the Attorney-General's advice. These changes have sparked intense controversy in Israel, with opposition leaders, activists, and international legal figures expressing concern over the potential erosion of judicial independence and the concentration of political power.", "contexts": ["By doing so, it would severely curtail the Supreme Court's authority of constitutional review of laws passed by the Knesset, which is controlled by the Government (the executive branch) that enjoys a political majority. Every country has checks and balances that set limits on the power of the political majority. In Israel, however, the Supreme Court is the sole balancing mechanism.\"\nAbolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\nArguments in favor of the reform\n\nThe reform will abolish the use of \"unreasonableness\" as grounds for review of administrative decisions. Although unreasonableness has its origins in British jurisprudence, the court has expanded on this doctrine since Israel's founding in 1948. Some have claimed that the courts' definition of the grounds of reasonableness is unique globally. An unreasonable administrative action has been defined as a situation in which the administrative authority failed to give proper weight to all relevant considerations which formed the basis of the administrative decision, and did not properly balance between all the relevant considerations, in accordance with their weight:\n\n    The only way to further the discussion about the substance of reasonableness is to recognize that reasonableness is neither a physical nor a metaphysical concept, but a normative one. Reasonableness means that one identifies the relevant considerations and then balances them according to their weight. Indeed, reasonableness is an evaluative process, not a descriptive process. It is not a concept that is defined by deductive logic. It is not merely rationality. A decision is reasonable if it was made by weighing the necessary considerations, including fundamental values in general and human rights in particular. Nothing is reasonable 'in itself'.\n\nThis expansive doctrine empowers the Supreme Court to strike down almost any administrative decision, even if it was taken by due legal authority. In an interview with Haaretz, former Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau criticized the use of the \"unreasonableness\" doctrine:\n\n    The justices in the older court did not set themselves up as the teachers of the generation. We did not think that our task was to teach the public fundamental or deep values of private or public morality. This doesn't mean that we didn't pay attention to values. This doesn't mean that we didn't make value judgements. But we understood the limitations of the Court's jurisdiction. We made sure that what we ruled on regarding values flowed out of the issue brought before us [...] The judge is not the teacher of the generation and is not a philosopher-king. His task is much more modest: to be a faithful interpreter of the law. Of the public's will as expressed by the Knesset, as representative of the public. Therefore, I believe that the judge's wisdom requires him to be cautious, sensitive, with broad discretion and without hubris.\n\nArguments against the reform\n\nAmir Fuchs, a lecturer in the Politics and Communication Department at the School of Government and Social Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, has argued in favor of the reasonableness doctrine, saying that \"its purpose is to prevent the government from passing entirely arbitrary decisions; but it is certainly not intended to replace the decision-making powers of the government, with those of the court. Like all other administrative law standards (the rules of natural justice, and standards such as the ban on extraneous interests and the requirement to take all relevant considerations into account), it is meant to ensure that the government does not exceed the boundaries of its law-given authority.\"\n\nYedidia Stern, former dean of the Law Faculty at Bar Ilan University, has defended the reasonableness doctrine, stating that without it, \"the members of the outgoing Knesset will have the power to make the final decision about who can run against them in the next election. Without judicial review they will be able to protect one another through the mechanism of parliamentary immunity.\"\n\nRuvi Ziegler, the programme director for Master of Laws in International Law, Human Rights and Advanced Legal Studies at the University of Reading, has written that \"the plan would strip courts of their power to hold the Executive properly accountable for its administrative decisions. This means decisions made by public authorities from the police to the tax authority, would no longer need to be considered \"reasonable\" to be accepted in judicial review. In practical terms this means anyone could be denied a license, a benefit, a service without being given suitable reasons and without having an effective remedy. The \"reasonableness\" standard, which is a key part of British legal heritage, is critical for good governance and must be maintained in the Israeli setting as well.\"", "Without judicial review they will be able to protect one another through the mechanism of parliamentary immunity.\"\n\nRuvi Ziegler, the programme director for Master of Laws in International Law, Human Rights and Advanced Legal Studies at the University of Reading, has written that \"the plan would strip courts of their power to hold the Executive properly accountable for its administrative decisions.

The \"reasonableness\" standard, which is a key part of British legal heritage, is critical for good governance and must be maintained in the Israeli setting as well.\"\nStatus of the Attorney-General\n\nAccording to the Government Basic Law Amendment proposed by Knesset Member Simcha Rothman, the government and ministers will be authorized to determine its legal position in any matter. Furthermore, they will be entitled to accept or reject the Attorney-General's advice. Currently, according to Supreme Court rulings, the Attorney-General's legal opinion is considered to reflect, from the point of view of the government, the current legal status, as long as the court does not rule otherwise.\n\nThe government will also be entitled to determine its position that will be presented in court. The government will be entitled to private representation should the Attorney-General refuse to represent its position. Currently, if the Attorney-General refuses to defend the government's position or presents another position, the Attorney General may decline to defend the government's action in court, and if the division of opinions is based on a legitimate interpretative conflict, the Attorney General may grant the government recourse to different legal representation.\n\nThe position of binding advice and representational monopoly in Israel is exceptional and even unique by global standards. As Dr. Eitan Levontin describes, \"there is no such thing, to the best of my understanding, in any other place. The legal situation in Israel is not a minority opinion, but rather a single opinion, and it seems to me that a chasm \u2014 not just a disagreement \u2014 lies between it and the legal situation in any comparable country.\" By contrast, in the UK, the US, Canada and Germany, the AG \u2014 or the parallel figure \u2014 is a political role similar to the minister, and in some countries is actually a government minister. As such, they have no power to bind the government to their positions; the government can act in oppositions to their positions; the government is authorized to dictate to the AG the position to present before courts; and he is forbidden to put together legal opinions absent government request.\n\nThe position of the Attorney General in Israel can only be understood against the background of the particular history of this position in Israel and against the background of Israel's regime, with its relatively weak system of checks and balances. For example, in a statement published by tens of Canadian legal experts, including former Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin and other former Justices of the Supreme Court, the differences between Israel and Canada's political systems were discussed, with the conclusion that \"Israel's system of government differs from that of other democracies, like Canada's, in its exceptional concentration of political power. Other democracies have a suite of mechanisms that distribute or moderate the exercise of political power.\"\nReactions\nMain article: Reactions to the 2023 Israeli judicial reform\n\nThe government's proposed reforms have sparked intense controversy in Israel.

Air raid sirens were activated in Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Rehovot, Rishon Lezion, and Palmachim Airbase. Hamas issued a call to arms, with commander Mohammad Deif calling on \"Muslims everywhere to launch an attack\" and to \"kill them [the enemy] wherever you may find them\".\n\nHamas employed tactics such as using aerial drones to disable Israeli observation posts, paragliders for infiltration into Israel, and motorcycles, which was unusual for Hamas. Palestinian militants opened fire on Israeli boats, while clashes broke out between Palestinians and the Israel Defense Forces along the Gaza perimeter fence. In the evening, Hamas launched another barrage of 150 rockets towards Israel, with explosions reported in Yavne, Givatayim, Bat Yam, Beit Dagan, Tel Aviv, and Rishon Lezion.\n\nSimultaneously, around 3,000 Hamas militants infiltrated Israel from Gaza using trucks, pickup trucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and paragliders. They took over checkpoints at Kerem Shalom and Erez, and created openings in the border fence in five other places. Images and videos showed armed and masked militants, riding pickup trucks and opening fire in Sderot. Other videos display Israelis taken prisoner, a burning Israeli tank, and militants driving Israeli military vehicles.\n\nHamas has also stated that its attack was in response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, rising Israeli settler violence and recent escalations at Al-Aqsa. Intelligence and security officials from multiple Western countries say that Hamas initiated the war to create a \"permanent\" state of war and to revive interest in the Palestinian cause.\nMilitary base attacks\nFurther information: Battle of Re'im and Battle of Zikim\n\nHamas militants carried out an amphibious landing in Zikim.", "The IRGC said that the 7 October attack was done by Hamas in revenge for the killing of its head, Qassem Soleimani in 2020, which Hamas denied.\nUnited States\nFurther information: United States support for Israel in the Israel\u2013Hamas war and 2023 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria\n\nPolling has indicated a divide between official government policy on the Israel\u2013Hamas war and the viewpoints of the general public. A large majority of Americans support an immediate ceasefire in the conflict. A plurality of Americans oppose American military aid to Israel and believe that the United States \"should be a neutral mediator\". A Gallup poll found that 50% of respondents supported Israel's actions in Gaza, while 45% disapproved. Young Americans were less supportive of Israel than older generations.\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, Israel, 13 October 2023\n\nHours after Hamas's attack, US President Biden promised \"rock-solid and unwavering\" support to Israel and called Hamas's attack \"unadulterated evil\", comparing the group to ISIS. To replenish Israel's stockpiles, the US said it would send Iron Dome missiles, small bombs, and JDAM conversion kits, in addition to fulfilling previous contracts to deliver F-35 fighter jets, CH-53 helicopters, and KC-46 air refueling tankers. Biden also called on Congress to pass $14.3 billion in emergency military aid to Israel. Details of weapons sent to Israel, which have been arriving daily, have been kept secret. Leaked details have shown that the US has sent laser-guided missiles, 155mm shells, new army vehicles, among others, at Israel's request.\n\nWhile the US says it is discussing with Israel about ways to minimize civilian casualties, the Pentagon said it would impose no limits on Israel's use of American weapons in the war. Annie Shiel of the Center for Civilians in Conflict expressed concerns, saying that America is responsible for ensuring that \"its assistance does not contribute to devastating civilian harm and possible violations of international humanitarian law\". Foreign Policy reported on a \"groundswell of opposition\" among US diplomats and national security officials, against what they perceived as Biden's \"blank check\" for the Israeli counterattack. \"More than 630 employees\" of the US Agency for International Development signed a letter calling for an \"immediate ceasefire\". US State Department official Josh Paul, who spent more than 11 years as the director of congressional and public affairs at the bureau overseeing arms transfers to foreign nations, resigned in protest at the US government's decision to send weapons to Israel.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of the United States Navy's Carrier Strike Group 12\u2014led by the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, and supported by the cruiser USS Normandy and the destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney, and USS Roosevelt\u2014to the Eastern Mediterranean. The United States Air Force augmented its F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter squadrons in the region, reportedly to deter other actors from entering the conflict.\n\nOn 15 October, it was reported that a US naval strike group composed of the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, the guided missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the guided missile destroyers USS Laboon, USS Mason and USS Gravely was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean. Austin also ordered that approximately 2,000 troops be prepared for possible deployment to Israel, according to several defense officials.\n\nOn 17 October, it was reported that a US naval group consisting of the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan, the amphibious transport dock USS Mesa Verde and the dock landing ship USS Carter Hall, was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea to transport the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit in case they were needed in the area.\nThe USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and USS Gerald R.

The first eruption started on the evening of 18 December 2023, at the Sundhn\u00fakur crater chain north of Grindav\u00edk, with lava spewing from fissures in the ground. The intensity of the eruption and accompanying seismic activity decreased early on 19 December 2023, with lava seen spreading laterally from both sides of the newly opened fissures. The eruption was described as the largest in the Reykjanes Peninsula since the beginning of eruptive activity in 2021, with lava fountains, up to 100 metres (330 ft) high, and was visible as far away as the capital Reykjav\u00edk, 42 kilometres (26 mi) away. The eruption ended on 21 December 2023, after the Icelandic Meteorological Office said no lava was erupting after a flight over the volcano, but clarified that it was \"too early to declare the eruption over.\" Sundhn\u00fakur is a crater row and currently active volcanic fissure that is part of the Reykjanes Peninsula rift zone.\n\nThe eruption was preceded by an intense earthquake swarm in the Eldv\u00f6rp\u2013Svartsengi volcanic system that began on 24 October 2023, caused by a magmatic intrusion underneath the area. The frequency and intensity of the earthquakes dramatically increased on 10 November 2023, with 20,000 tremors recorded by that time, the largest of which exceeded magnitude 5.3. An evacuation was ordered in Grindav\u00edk, and large-scale subsidence in and around the town caused significant damage.\n\nOn 14 January 2024, a second fissure erupted north of Grindav\u00edk with most of its lava steered away from the town by newly constructed protection barriers. A few hours later, a third fissure opened less than 100 metres (330 ft) from the town inside the protection barriers, with its lava reaching and burning down three residential houses.\n\nA third eruption began on 8 February 2024 about a kilometer north of Grindav\u00edk, in the same area as the December eruption, with a fissure about three kilometers long effusively erupting lava on top of earlier flows.\n\nOne person has been reported missing after falling into a crack created by the earthquakes.\nEarthquakes\n2023 Iceland earthquakes\nMap\nWikimedia | \u00a9 OpenStreetMap\nMap of 2023 Iceland earthquakes and eruption (map data)\nUTC time\t2023-11-10 18:00:56\nUSGS-ANSS\tComCat\nLocal date\t24 October 2023\n(23 days)\nMagnitude\t5.3 Mw(largest tremor)\u202f\nDepth\t2\u201310 km (1.2\u20136.2 mi)\nEpicenter\t63.955\u00b0N 22.358\u00b0W\nAreas affected\tReykjanes Peninsula, Iceland\nMax. intensity\tVIII (Severe)\nCasualties\t1 missing\nMap of volcanic systems on the Reykjanes Peninsula.

Seven intrusions have occurred in the Eldv\u00f6rp-Svartsengi volcanic system since December 2019, with the latest two contributing to the current eruption series. Prior intrusions did not result in an eruption. Volcanic unrest on the peninsula during this period had mostly been associated with the Fagradalsfjall system, where three out of four confirmed magmatic intrusions culminated in volcanic eruptions.\n\nAlthough earthquakes are a frequent occurrence in Iceland due to the island's location, straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, the recent swarm was noted for being more extensive than usual. A total of five identified volcanic eruptions have occurred in the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021.", "Officials said residents of Grindav\u00edk would be allowed back into the town.\n\nThe IMO said the eruption occurred at around 22:17 UTC following a series of small earthquakes at around 21:00. It pinpointed the origin of the eruption near Hagafell, about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) north-east of Grindav\u00edk, and noted that the eruption stemmed from a fissure with a length of about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi), with lava flowing at a rate of around 100 to 200 cubic metres per second adding that seismic activity appeared to be moving towards the direction of Grindav\u00edk. An Icelandic Civil Defence official told the public broadcaster R\u00daV that the eruption had happened quickly and appeared to be \"quite a large event\".\nJanuary 2024 eruption\nAerial photograph of the eruption on 14 January.\n\nOn 14 January 2024 around 7:57 UTC, a second eruption began around 400\u2013500 metres (1,300\u20131,600 ft) north of Grindav\u00edk following seismic activity that began from the Sundhn\u00faksg\u00edgar crater. Fissures were reported to have opened up on both sides of the anti-lava defences, and it was estimated that lava would reach the town within 24 hours. A successful mission was launched to save several pieces of heavy machinery used to construct the barriers. The lava cut off one of the main roads leading into Grindav\u00edk. The initial fissure reached a length of up to 900 metres (3,000 ft).\n\nAround noon, another fissure, measuring about 100 metres (330 ft), opened only metres from the outermost houses of the town and subsequently set three houses on fire before ceasing after a few hours. Evacuation orders were reimplemented in Grindav\u00edk, while the Icelandic Coast Guard deployed a helicopter to monitor the situation. Volcanic activity was seen to have \u201cdecreased considerably\u201d by 15 January.\n\nEvgenia Ilyinskaya, a volcanologist from the University of Leeds, told the BBC that the eruption suggested that the Reykjanes peninsula was likely entering a long-term period of frequent eruptions that could last for centuries, which she termed the New Reykjanes Fires after a previous occurrence in the 12th century.\n\nPrior to the eruption, on 10 January, a worker fell into a deep crevice in Grindav\u00edk while working to repair it. Despite an extensive search, the man was not found. The search was called off on the evening of 12 January.\nFebruary 2024 eruption\nEruption 8. February 2024\n\nOn 8 February 2024 at 6:03 UTC the third eruption started north of S\u00fdlingarfell following intensive seismic activity that began 30 minutes prior. The eruption produced lava fountains with a height measuring between 50 to 80 metres in height and a three-kilometer high volcanic plume. A three-kilometer long fissure opened in the same area as the December eruption, between the Sundhn\u00fakur craters and the hill of St\u00f3ra-Sk\u00f3gfell. The lava was reported to be flowing east and west at a safe distance from Grindav\u00edk, but caused damage to critical infrastructure around the Svartsengi power station. Unlike in the previous eruptions on the peninsula, the 8 February eruption produced quantities of black ash mixed with steam. This is theorised to be the result of groundwater boiling and mixing with magma to create ash.\nImpact\nClosure of the road to Grindav\u00edk\nGrindav\u00edk\n\nFollowing the 5.2 tremor on 10 November, a state of emergency was declared, and evacuation plans were put into effect for Grindav\u00edk. This culminated in the relocation of nearly 4,000 residents, nearly 1 percent of Iceland's entire population. The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management deployed the Icelandic Coast Guard Vessel \u00de\u00f3r to the area \"for safety purposes\". It also closed all roads to Grindav\u00edk except for emergency and evacuation purposes. On 13 November, authorities allowed residents to return briefly to the town to retrieve their belongings. Boat owners were also allowed to remove their vessels from the harbour. The Icelandic government is seeking to accommodate displaced residents in holiday homes and little-used properties while the emergency continues. The subsidence, faulting and earthquakes have caused widespread damage to properties and infrastructure in the town.

The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province's inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.\n\nThe Khan of Kalat lent great support to the Pakistan Movement but also desired to declare independence. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it clear that the princely states with the lapse of British paramountcy would have to join either India or Pakistan, keeping in mind their geographic and demographic compulsions.\n\nOn 19 July, Mountbatten called a Round Table Conference meeting between representatives of the State of Kalat and Government of Pakistan. Mountbatten discussed with them the status of the Kalat State. The representatives of Kalat argued that Kalat, as per the treaty of 1876, was an independent and sovereign state and not an Indian state. Mountbatten accepted this position for the purpose of negotiation, although Kalat had always been a princely state. Thus, Mountbatten confined the topic of discussion to the leased areas of Quetta, Nushki, Nasirabad and Bolan. He explained that Pakistan rejected Kalat's claims that these areas should be returned to Kalat.\n\nPakistan's position was that it would inherit all treaty obligations incurred by India to the foreign states. Kalat argued that the leases clearly stated that the other party besides Kalat was the British Government alone. Kalat argued that it was a personal agreement and there was no provision that the leases to the British would be inherited by others. Therefore, since the agreement was between Kalat and the British Government, Pakistan could not be the latter's successor party.\n\nPakistan did not agree that the agreement was personal as personal agreements by nature implied that only a particular person was involved. Mountbatten also said that according to international law, treaties such as the one being discussed were inherited by successors and not invalidated by a transfer of power. Mountbatten also suggested that in case there was no agreement the matter could be put before an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nKalat wished to have further discussions on the matter. Kalat also argued that in case of a vote in the leased areas between joining Kalat and joining Pakistan then the vote would go in favour of the former. Pakistan did not agree that the vote would have such a result.\n\nKalat also expressed its deepest desire to remain on friendly terms with Pakistan and stated that it understood that Jinnah, who was anxious for a correct decision, wanted more time to study the issues between Kalat and Pakistan. Mountbatten, however, suggested that Jinnah not be brought into the discussions.\n\nMountbatten insisted that Kalat and Pakistan sign a standstill agreement, which both countries did. The Standstill Agreement also stipulated that both parties would discuss as soon as possible about their relationship concerning Defence and External Affairs. According to the Article I, 'The Government of Pakistan agrees that Kalat is an independent State, being quite different in status from other States of India'. However, the Article IV stated:\n\n    a standstill agreement will be made between Pakistan and Kalat by which Pakistan shall stand committed to all the responsibilities agreements signed by Kalat and the British Government from 1839 to 1947 and by this, Pakistan shall be the legal, constitutional and political successor of the British.\n\nThrough this agreement, the British Paramountcy was effectively transferred to Pakistan.\n\nHowever, without making any agreement with Pakistan and in violation of the Standstill Agreement the Khan of Kalat declared independence.

The signing of the Instrument of Accession by Ahmad Yar Khan, led his brother, Prince Abdul Karim, to revolt against his brother's decision in July 1948. Princes Agha Abdul Karim Baloch and Muhammad Rahim, refused to lay down arms, leading the Dosht-e Jhalawan in unconventional attacks on the army until 1950. The Princes fought a lone battle without support from the rest of Balochistan. Jinnah and his successors allowed Yar Khan to retain his title until the province's dissolution in 1955.\nSecond conflict\n\nNawab Nauroz Khan took up arms in resistance to the One Unit policy, which decreased government representation for tribal leaders, from 1958 to 1959. He and his followers started a guerrilla war against Pakistan, and were arrested, charged with treason, and imprisoned in Hyderabad. Five of his family members, sons and nephews, were subsequently hanged on charges of treason and aiding in the murder of Pakistani troops. Nawab Nauroz Khan later died in captivity. Nawab Nauroz Khan fought a lone battle as the rest of Balochistan did not support the uprising.\nThird conflict\n\nAfter the second conflict, a Baloch separatist movement gained momentum in the 1960s, following the introduction of a new constitution in 1956 which limited provincial autonomy and enacted the 'One Unit' concept of political organisation in Pakistan. Tension continued to grow amid consistent political disorder and instability at the federal level. The federal government tasked the Pakistan Army with building several new bases in key areas of Balochistan. Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri led like-minded militants into guerrilla warfare from 1963 to 1969 by creating their own insurgent bases. Their goal was to force Pakistan to share revenue generated from the Sui gas fields with the tribal leaders. The insurgents bombed railway tracks and ambushed convoys. The Army retaliated by destroying the militant camps. This insurgency ended in 1969, with the Baloch separatists agreeing to a ceasefire. In 1970 Pakistani President Yahya Khan abolished the \"One Unit\" policy, which led to the recognition of Balochistan as the fourth province of West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan), including all the Balochistani princely states, the High Commissioners Province, and Gwadar, an 800 km2 coastal area purchased from Oman by the Pakistani government.[citation needed]\nFourth conflict, 1973\u20131977\nFurther information: Baloch Insurgency and Rahimuddin's Stabilization\n\nThe unrest continued into the 1970s, culminating in a government-ordered military operation in the region in 1973.\n\nIn 1973, citing treason, President Bhutto dismissed the provincial governments of Balochistan and NWFP and imposed martial law in those areas, which led to armed insurgency. Khair Bakhsh Marri formed the Balochistan People's Liberation Front (BPLF), which led large numbers of Marri and Mengal tribesmen into guerrilla warfare against the central government.\n\nAssisted by Iran, Pakistani forces inflicted heavy casualties on the separatists.

On 19 October, the United States Navy destroyer USS Carney shot down several missiles that were traveling north over the Red Sea towards Israel. On 31 October, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said that the group had launched ballistic missiles and drones towards Israel, and that they would continue to do so \"to help the Palestinians to victory\" in an event that has been misrepresented in some news sites as a declaration of war by Yemen. On 19 November, tensions increased when the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship chartered by a Japanese logistics company with 25 individuals on board, was hijacked by the Houthis using a Mil Mi-17 helicopter.\n\nOn 3 December, the Houthis stated that they had attacked two ships, the Unity Explorer and Number 9, allegedly linked to Israel, in order \"to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea\". Any ship destined for Israel, according to the group, was a \"legitimate target\".", "All Palestinians in that region, including those in Gaza City, were given 24 hours to evacuate to the south. The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs responded by telling residents in northern Gaza to \"remain steadfast in your homes and stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation\".\n\nThe statement by Israel faced widespread backlash; with numerous agencies, such as Doctors Without Borders, the World Health Organization, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, among others, condemning the order as \"outrageous\" and \"impossible\" while calling for an immediate reversal of the order.\n\nAs a part of the order, the IDF announced a six-hour window from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. local time on 13 October, for refugees to flee south along specified routes within the Gaza Strip. An explosion at 5:30 p.m. along one of the safe routes killed 70 people. Some sources attributed it to an IDF airstrike, while CNN said the cause was unclear. The Jerusalem Post said open-source analysts believed the explosion originated from a car on the ground, but the cause was unclear. The Financial Times carried out an investigation, concluding \"analysis of the video footage rules out most explanations aside from an Israeli strike\", although it was \"difficult to conclusively prove whether these blasts came from an IDF strike, a potential Palestinian rocket misfire or even a car bomb\".\n\nThe IDF stated Hamas set up roadblocks to keep Gaza residents from evacuating south and caused traffic jams.

Palestinian statements that it was an Israeli airstrike were denied by the IDF, which stated that the explosion resulted from a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The PIJ denied any involvement. An independent analysis by Human Rights Watch indicated that the evidence pointed to a misfired Palestinian rocket as the cause, but stated that further investigation was required.\n\nOn 18 October, President Biden said the Pentagon had independently concluded that the explosion was not caused by Israel, but by \"the other team\", based on data from the Defense Department. Over the next few days, Canadian, British, and French officials announced that their respective intelligence agencies concluded the cause to be a failed Palestinian rocket and not an Israeli airstrike.

These changes include:\n\n1. Denying the Supreme Court the power to review Basic Laws: The reform proposes to amend the Basic Laws to remove the power of judicial review from the Supreme Court. This means that the Court will no longer be able to strike down laws passed by the Knesset as unconstitutional.\n2. Limiting the power of the Supreme Court to review administrative decisions: The reform proposes to restrict the scope of the Supreme Court's power to review administrative decisions, making it more difficult for the Court to intervene in matters related to government policy and decision-making.\n3. Introducing an override clause: The reform proposes to introduce an override clause that would allow the Knesset to overturn a Supreme Court decision nullifying a law passed by the Knesset. This would give the Knesset the power to override the Supreme Court's decisions on legislation, effectively limiting the Court's ability to review and strike down laws passed by the Knesset.\n4. Changing the composition of the committee responsible for selecting judges: The reform proposes to change the composition of the committee responsible for selecting judges, giving the government more control over the selection and dismissal of judges. This could lead to a situation where the government appoints judges who are more likely to share its views and be less independent in their decision-making.\n\nOverall, the proposed reform aims to limit the power of the Israeli Supreme Court and reduce its ability to check and balance the actions of the government. This could have significant implications for the rule of law and democratic governance in Israel, as it would undermine the Court's ability to ensure that the government acts in accordance with the law and respects individual rights and freedoms.", "contexts": ["Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards.\" (Isaiah 1:21\u201323)\nIsraeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n\nAll legislation, government orders, and administrative actions of state bodies are subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court of Israel, which has as of several decades ago assumed the power to strike down legislation and reverse executive decisions it determines to be in violation of Israel's Basic Laws.\n\nThis role of the Supreme Court in Israel has been seen by those who oppose the reform as crucial for the protection of human rights in light of its otherwise weak system of checks and balances, which lacks a bicameral legislative system, a president with executive powers, a federal government, regional elections, membership in a regional supra-governmental organization, or acceptance of the International Court of Justice's authority.\n\nThe exercise of these powers by the court has often sparked controversy within Israel, usually among right-wing politicians and their supporters. Many of the court's rulings, particularly those limiting the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, as well as those affecting ultra-Orthodox autonomy and way of life have sparked resentment among ultra-Orthodox and Religious Zionist politicians, many of whom have accused the court of engaging in judicial activism in favor of left-wing causes.\n1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\nFurther information: Basic Laws of Israel \u00a7 The Constitutional Revolution of 1992\u20131995\n[icon]\t\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2023)\n\nBetween 1992 and 1999, Supreme Court Justice Aharon Barak developed a doctrine in a series of rulings, the guiding principle of which is the introduction of human rights indirectly to private law. This is done with the help of concepts such as \"good faith\", \"public policy\" or \"violation of legal duty\" that the judges apply in their rulings. The proponents of judicial reform claim that the problem is that the concepts depend on the judge who interprets them, resulting in legal uncertainty, opening private and government action to judicial review according to the dictates of the judge's conscience and not necessarily according to the laws established by the legislature.\n2018\u20132022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n\nWithin the context of the 2018\u20132022 Israeli political crisis, the 2022 legislative election was the fifth Knesset election in nearly four years, as no party had been able to form a stable coalition government since 2019. In the election, the right-wing bloc won a majority of seats in the Knesset, with far-right elements such as the Religious Zionist Party making record-breaking gains.\n\nFollowing the election, Likud leader and former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed the thirty-seventh government of Israel, assigning many powerful positions in the new government to previously marginalized far-right politicians who had long advocated policies that conflicted with many of the supreme court's precedents and have sought to curtail its powers. Among the incoming government's official policy guidelines was a commitment to judicial reform.\nLegislative history\nThe Supreme Court of Israel struck down the law on 1 January 2024. HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024).\n\nOn 4 January 2023, newly appointed Justice Minister Yariv Levin announced his intention to overhaul Israel's judiciary. On 11 January, Levin published a draft of his proposed changes, which included the following changes to the judiciary, executive and legislative processes and functions:\n\n    Judicial selection \u2014 The committee which is responsible for recommending the appointment of judges currently consists of serving judges, representatives of the Israel Bar Association, Knesset members and government Ministers, and is composed as such that agreement is required between these different groups. The proposed changes seek to change the composition of the committee, giving a majority of votes to the government and thus giving the government control over the selection and dismissal of all judges, including of the Supreme Court.\n    Judicial review \u2014 The proposed changes seek to curb judicial review over legislation, including by explicitly legislating against the Supreme Court's exercise of judicial review of Basic Laws, and requiring a full bench of Supreme Court justices to preside over any case in which the legality of regular legislation passed by the Knesset is evaluated, and 80% of them to rule for invalidation of such legislation.\n    Knesset override \u2014 The proposed changes seek to allow the Knesset to overrule a decision by the Supreme Court on the legality of legislation, where the Knesset votes with a majority (of 61, out of 120 Knesset members) against the court decision.", "The proposed legislation argues that as the Basic Laws are Israel's supreme legal norms, the Court derives its power of judicial review from the Basic Laws themselves and thus cannot review or strike down the Basic Laws themselves. The proposal seeks to deny judicial review over Basic Laws, in order to guarantee the Supreme Court's subjection to the rule of name and to the source of democratic authority.\n\nProponents of this change argue that this is similar to the majority of Western countries in which there is no judicial review over constitutional norms. The legal advisor to the Committee through which this reform is being progressed published an opinion stating he had found no precedent in any democratic country for judicial review over legislation to require a unanimous decision of every judge on the relevant court.\nOverride clause\nMain article: Override clause (Israel)\n\nAnother proposal is to allow the Knesset to reject the interpretation given by the Supreme Court to a Basic Law and to override a Supreme Court decision nullifying a law. According to the proposal, the Knesset will be able to, under specific conditions, override a judicial decision nullifying a law. Proponents argue that the proposed override clause is not to exempt the Knesset from its commitments to constitutional values, but rather to give the legislators the ability to decide differently than the court.\n\nIn one form of the proposal, it is proposed that should the Supreme Court nullify a law in full consensus of all judges, the Knesset shall not be able to pass an override law during its term. However, if the Supreme Court decision nullifying primary legislation was not taken in full consensus, it is proposed to allow the Knesset to override the Supreme Court decision nullifying the law with a majority of 61 Knesset members, as long as the law states explicitly that the law will be valid notwithstanding the Supreme Court's ruling. The override will remain valid for the term of the next Knesset, which may review it anew. As such, it is stated that the force of the override is limited to four years or until the end of the first year of the term of a new Knesset after the Knesset that passed the override law, according to the later event.\n\nIt is further proposed that the Knesset will be able to override the judgement to nullify a law given in full consensus. However, this is on condition that the Knesset that passes the override is a different Knesset than that which passed the nullified law, therefore expressing two Knessets' support for a different value framework than that of the Supreme Court. In such a case, as well as in a case when a regular override is passed by two Knessets, the override will be permanent.\n\nProponents argue that similar clauses exist in Canada, Finland and the Australian state of Victoria. However, studies have pointed out the differences between Israel's system and these countries which affect the impact of such clauses on the political system. For example, a study conducted by Amichai Cohen of 66 democracies to identify and analyze the structural-formal restraints placed on the political branch concluded that \"without granting the judicial branch the authority to oversee the other branches, Israel will become the sole democracy of significant size in which one elected authority wields practically unlimited power.\"\n\nThis proposal has been criticized for giving too much power to the Knesset, far beyond the power wielded by other executive and legislature bodies in Western countries. For example, the Israel Democracy Institute has stated that an \"override clause would give a Knesset majority absolute power to enact laws, notwithstanding the stipulations of the Basic Laws. By doing so, it would severely curtail the Supreme Court's authority of constitutional review of laws passed by the Knesset, which is controlled by the Government (the executive branch) that enjoys a political majority. Every country has checks and balances that set limits on the power of the political majority. In Israel, however, the Supreme Court is the sole balancing mechanism.\"\nAbolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\nArguments in favor of the reform\n\nThe reform will abolish the use of \"unreasonableness\" as grounds for review of administrative decisions. Although unreasonableness has its origins in British jurisprudence, the court has expanded on this doctrine since Israel's founding in 1948. Some have claimed that the courts' definition of the grounds of reasonableness is unique globally."]}, {"query": "Which organization confirmed reports of an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school in the Jabalia refugee camp, resulting in the deaths of at least 15 people and injuries to dozens more?", "response": "\nAccording to the Gaza health ministry, the attack on the UN-run school in the Jabalia refugee camp was confirmed by the United Nations.", "contexts": ["The IDF released what it stated was an intercepted call between Hamas operatives and the head of the Indonesia Hospital, where they discuss diverting some of the hospital's fuel supply to Hamas.\n\nTwo days later, the Gaza health ministry stated that Israel struck an ambulance convoy directly in front of Al-Shifa Hospital, killing at least 15 people and injuring 60 more.

A Hamas official said that after the exchange, the only remaining hostages were \"soldiers and civilian men who served in the occupation army\", and refused to exchange them until \"all our prisoners are freed and a ceasefire takes hold\".

The maps were criticized for being hard to access due to the lack of electricity and internet connectivity, and for causing confusion or panic.", "On 7 October 2023, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 764 civilians, were killed, and 248 persons taken hostage during the initial attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip. Since then, over 26,751 Palestinians (the majority of whom were women and children) in the Gaza Strip have been killed according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between combatant and civilian casualties in its reports. The IDF and US intelligence estimate Israel killed 5,000-9,000 Hamas combatants as of 21 January 2024. A further 320 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank by Israel military and settlers. Casualties have also occurred in other parts of Israel, as well as in southern Lebanon, and Syria.\n\nMonitoring group Action on Armed Violence said that each Israeli airstrike caused an average of 10.1 civilian deaths and that the figure suggested a notable change in Israel's targeting approach. The previous Israeli campaigns in Gaza produced the averages of 1.3\u20131.7, while in the sieges of Mosul, Aleppo the ratio exceeded 20 civilian casualties per airstrike. Israel uses an AI system known as Gospel for its targeting process and experts are sceptical that such a system reduces civilian harm. Weeks into the assault, details emerged about Habsora, a system of target calculation \"which is largely built on artificial intelligence and can 'generate' targets almost automatically at a rate that far exceeds what was previously possible.\" According to the Israel Defense Forces, the system produces recommendations for air-strikes \"with the goal of a complete match between the recommendation of the machine and the identification carried out by a person.\" While the exact calculations for targeting are fairly opaque, the system \"typically analyze large sets of information from a range of sources, such as drone footage, intercepted communications, surveillance data and information drawn from monitoring the movements and behaviour patterns of individuals and large groups.\" Coupled with a greater permissiveness for civilian targeting and the claim that Hamas operatives are embedded in civilian infrastructure, this technological production of \"legitimate military targets\" proceeds also from the political imaginary in which all Gazans \u2013 including children, who comprise a devastating proportion of casualties \u2013 are collectively rendered as terroristic colluders with Hamas, thus justifying what immediately became a total war against the Palestinian \"Other\".\n\nThe rate of killing exceeds that of US-led attacks in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, which were widely criticized by rights groups. The first month of the war has been the deadliest conflict for children this century.\n\nMultiple generations of families have been killed in Israeli attacks. As of 31 October, Amnesty International has documented five cases of entire families being killed in Israeli airstrikes. The Associated Press reported that the killing of entire families in single airstrikes by Israel has \"raised troubling questions about Israeli military tactics.\" As of 15 October 47 families had been completely wiped away from the population registry, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Financial Times reported how Palestinian families could have multiple generations living in a single multistory building has had the effect of those families being nearly completely wiped out by airstrikes. As of 23 November, according to Gazan health officials, 312 families had suffered the loss of more than 10 members. This had also led to children being left without any surviving family, with the acronym \"WCNSF\" for \"wounded child, no surviving family\" being increasingly used.\nHealthcare collapse\nMain article: Timeline of the Gaza Strip healthcare collapse\nSee also: Attacks on health facilities during the Israel\u2013Hamas war, Al-Shifa Hospital siege, and Kamal Adwan Hospital siege\nExternal videos\nvideo icon Emily \"Cali\" Callahan, an American nurse who worked in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders until early November, describes the humanitarian situation in Gaza to CNN's Anderson Cooper\n\nHospitals faced a lack of fuel and relied on backup generators for the first two weeks of the war.

Jill Goldenziel, a professor at the United States National Defense University and Marine Corps University, states that if Israel conducted every strike legally and with utmost precision, civilian casualties in war would still remain, and the goal of a proportionality analysis is to decide whether they are excessive. Israeli security officials state that their proportionality criteria in this conflict are unchanged and that they receive legal advice in relation to strikes. Other Israeli officials, speaking anonymously, acknowledged that Israel has struck \"private residences and public structures, like the Gaza Parliament and the Islamic University\", which would not previously have been considered valuable enough to justify the risk to civilian life.\nUN condemnation\n\nIndependent United Nations experts condemned the Israel Defense Forces' actions in Gaza, saying Israel had resorted to \"indiscriminate military attacks\" and \"collective punishment\". Israeli authorities said that the airstrikes are intended to degrade the military infrastructure that is frequently constructed in close proximity to residential areas and civilian establishments. They also denounced the \"deliberate and widespread killing and hostage-taking of innocent civilians\" by Hamas, calling them \"heinous violations of international law and international crimes\". Israel's forced evacuation of northern Gaza also drew international condemnation. On 13 October, Paula Gaviria Betancur, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, called it a \"crime against humanity\". On 14 October, Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, characterized it as a \"repeat of the 1948 Nakba\", noting Israeli public officials' open advocacy for another Nakba. On 16 November, UN experts reported that \"grave violations\" committed by Israeli forces against the Palestinians of Gaza \"point to a genocide in the making\" and called on the international community to prevent this unfolding genocide. The OHCHR expressed concern regarding reports of \"mass detentions, ill-treatment and enforced disappearances of possibly thousands of Palestinians\" in the north of Gaza.\nDestruction of cultural heritage\n\nOver 100 landmarks have been destroyed or damaged by Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip according to a report by Heritage for Peace group.

US National Security Advisor John Kirby said that \"Hamas agreed to allow the Red Cross access to these hostages while the pause was in place,\" which did not \"happen and is still not happening\".\n\nIsrael adopted a grid system to order precise evacuations within Gaza, released a map online, and dropped leaflets with a QR code for the link. The maps were criticized for being hard to access due to the lack of electricity and internet connectivity, and for causing confusion or panic. Some evacuation instructions have been vague or contradictory, and Israel has struck areas it had told people to evacuate to.\n\nExperts said they had not seen significant changes in Israeli prosecution of the war due to its warnings to civilians appearing ineffective and it being unclear if anywhere in Gaza is safe. Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said in a press release that \"US-made weapons facilitated the mass killings of extended families\". Amnesty found no evidence of military targets at the sites of the strikes, or any indication that the occupants of the homes were affiliated with Hamas, prompting the group to request that the airstrikes be investigated as possible war crimes. Several decomposed babies were found in the ICU of Al-Nasr Children's Hospital in northern Gaza, two weeks after its forced evacuation. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warned against replacing \"a tactical victory with a strategic defeat\" if Israel does not work towards protecting Palestinian civilians. The US State Department said it was too early to definitively assess whether Israel was heeding US calls to protect civilians.\n\nThe IDF reported that its troops had reached the centers of Khan Younis, Jabalia, and Shejaiya reporting the most \"intense fighting\" since the ground invasion of Gaza began. Intensified bombing pushed Palestinian civilians further south to Rafah.\n\nOn 7 December, Israel detained 150 men in the Gaza Strip, with dozens more detained on 10 December. According to Israel, the detentions followed a mass surrender of Hamas militants. The New York Times reported that the statement about Hamas fighters surrendering was made after video and photographs of \"men stripped to their underwear, sitting or kneeling on the ground, with some bound and blindfolded\" were seen on social media.The Guardian reported that among the people seen in the images were people identified as civilians, among them a journalist. The ICRC said it was concerned by the images and that it strongly emphasized \"the importance of treating all those detained with humanity and dignity, in accordance with international humanitarian law\". The BBC reported that a video of the apparent surrender of weapons is unclear whether a man is \"surrendering\" weapons or just moving them as instructed, suggested the event was performed for the camera, rather than as an act of authentic surrender, and that it not known whether the individuals shown have any involvement with Hamas or the 7 October attack. Haaretz reported that Israeli security officials believed that approximately 10\u201315% of the people shown in the video were actually affiliated with Hamas, and that despite the public statements by Israel that this was not a \"massive surrender\" by Hamas units. Amnesty International described the treatment of those detained on 7 December as a violation of international law.\n\nOn 8 and 9 December, the IDF released footage of what it said was its soldiers engaging combatants near and inside two schools in Shejaiya. According to the IDF, fighters also discovered a tunnel leading from one of the schools to a nearby mosque. It also released footage of armament that it stated was found on the campus of Al-Azhar University, along with a tunnel shaft leading to a school 1 km away. The Israeli military said that, since it designated a humanitarian zone for civilians in the Gaza Strip on 18 October 116 rockets had been fired from there toward Israel, including 38 falling inside Gaza.\n\nThe Pentagon announced on 9 December that the Biden administration had authorized the sale of around 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition to Israel without congressional authorization by using emergency powers. On 29 December, it did so again to supply Israel with $147.5 million worth of artillery shells and related items.\n\nOn 15 December, the IDF released a statement announcing that they had killed three of their own hostages by friendly fire. According to the Israeli military, they \"mistakenly identified three Israeli hostages as a threat\" during operations in Shuja'iyya and subsequently fired at them, killing them."]}, {"query": "Which geothermal site in Iceland, known for its popular spa, was closed to visitors from November 9 to December 17, 2021, due to earthquakes and the potential risk of falling rocks?", "response": "Blue Lagoon", "contexts": ["and 9 p.m. to retrieve valuables, attend to their properties, and conduct business activities.

The area, under continuous surveillance, is still considered dangerous. Residents were advised to keep records of valuables taken and to contact their insurance companies, and to be cautious as houses might be unsafe. However, a resident of Grindav\u00edk was later caught staying at his home with his wife for several nights and was threatened with arrest.\n\nThe earthquakes in Grindav\u00edk significantly affected infrastructure and homes. Around 120 properties suffered damage, with between 10 and 20 being deemed uninhabitable. Two weeks following the earthquakes, a thorough damage assessment was initiated and was ongoing. The estimated total cost of the damages is up to 10 billion ISK. Property owners facing irreparable damage to their homes were obligated to allocate a segment of their insurance compensation\u2014earmarked primarily for on-site repairs or reconstruction\u2014to cover a disposal fee. In cases where rebuilding at the original location was not permitted, property owners were then allowed to use their insurance proceeds to buy homes elsewhere.\nBlue Lagoon\n\nThe management of the Blue Lagoon spa announced the site's closure to visitors from 9 to 16 November as a precaution following the earthquakes. Rocks dislodged by the earthquakes were reported to have fallen onto roads in the area, and 30 guests left the resort following a 4.8 tremor in the early hours of 9 November. In addition to these safety concerns, the closure was also implemented to reduce increased stress on staff. The management has assured that all staff will receive their full salaries during the closure period. Furthermore, guests who were evacuated as a result of the tremor will be provided with a full refund.\n\nHelga \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir, CEO of the Blue Lagoon, confirmed that the seismic activity at Svartsengi caused no visible damage or structural impairment to their facilities. The buildings, designed for earthquake resilience, remained intact and structurally sound.

Staff members of the Blue Lagoon were seen bathing in the spa's geothermal waters on 8 December. Prior to reopening, the staff were trained in evacuation procedures to ensure preparedness for any emergencies, while the administration prepared an evacuation process, expected to take around two hours in case of emergency. Additionally, guests were to be informed about the current situation.\n\nThe Blue Lagoon remained open for just two days before it closed again after the 18 December eruption only 2 to 3 kilometres (1.2 to 1.9 mi) away. All guests and staff were evacuated from the site roughly one to two hours before the eruption. The Blue Lagoon reopened on 6 January, with all facilities back in operation by 10 January.

The first eruption started on the evening of 18 December 2023, at the Sundhn\u00fakur crater chain north of Grindav\u00edk, with lava spewing from fissures in the ground. The intensity of the eruption and accompanying seismic activity decreased early on 19 December 2023, with lava seen spreading laterally from both sides of the newly opened fissures. The eruption was described as the largest in the Reykjanes Peninsula since the beginning of eruptive activity in 2021, with lava fountains, up to 100 metres (330 ft) high, and was visible as far away as the capital Reykjav\u00edk, 42 kilometres (26 mi) away. The eruption ended on 21 December 2023, after the Icelandic Meteorological Office said no lava was erupting after a flight over the volcano, but clarified that it was \"too early to declare the eruption over.\" Sundhn\u00fakur is a crater row and currently active volcanic fissure that is part of the Reykjanes Peninsula rift zone.\n\nThe eruption was preceded by an intense earthquake swarm in the Eldv\u00f6rp\u2013Svartsengi volcanic system that began on 24 October 2023, caused by a magmatic intrusion underneath the area. The frequency and intensity of the earthquakes dramatically increased on 10 November 2023, with 20,000 tremors recorded by that time, the largest of which exceeded magnitude 5.3. An evacuation was ordered in Grindav\u00edk, and large-scale subsidence in and around the town caused significant damage.\n\nOn 14 January 2024, a second fissure erupted north of Grindav\u00edk with most of its lava steered away from the town by newly constructed protection barriers. A few hours later, a third fissure opened less than 100 metres (330 ft) from the town inside the protection barriers, with its lava reaching and burning down three residential houses.\n\nA third eruption began on 8 February 2024 about a kilometer north of Grindav\u00edk, in the same area as the December eruption, with a fissure about three kilometers long effusively erupting lava on top of earlier flows.\n\nOne person has been reported missing after falling into a crack created by the earthquakes.\nEarthquakes\n2023 Iceland earthquakes\nMap\nWikimedia | \u00a9 OpenStreetMap\nMap of 2023 Iceland earthquakes and eruption (map data)\nUTC time\t2023-11-10 18:00:56\nUSGS-ANSS\tComCat\nLocal date\t24 October 2023\n(23 days)\nMagnitude\t5.3 Mw(largest tremor)\u202f\nDepth\t2\u201310 km (1.2\u20136.2 mi)\nEpicenter\t63.955\u00b0N 22.358\u00b0W\nAreas affected\tReykjanes Peninsula, Iceland\nMax. intensity\tVIII (Severe)\nCasualties\t1 missing\nMap of volcanic systems on the Reykjanes Peninsula.

A plurality of Americans oppose American military aid to Israel and believe that the United States \"should be a neutral mediator\". A Gallup poll found that 50% of respondents supported Israel's actions in Gaza, while 45% disapproved. Young Americans were less supportive of Israel than older generations.\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, Israel, 13 October 2023\n\nHours after Hamas's attack, US President Biden promised \"rock-solid and unwavering\" support to Israel and called Hamas's attack \"unadulterated evil\", comparing the group to ISIS. To replenish Israel's stockpiles, the US said it would send Iron Dome missiles, small bombs, and JDAM conversion kits, in addition to fulfilling previous contracts to deliver F-35 fighter jets, CH-53 helicopters, and KC-46 air refueling tankers. Biden also called on Congress to pass $14.3 billion in emergency military aid to Israel. Details of weapons sent to Israel, which have been arriving daily, have been kept secret. Leaked details have shown that the US has sent laser-guided missiles, 155mm shells, new army vehicles, among others, at Israel's request.\n\nWhile the US says it is discussing with Israel about ways to minimize civilian casualties, the Pentagon said it would impose no limits on Israel's use of American weapons in the war. Annie Shiel of the Center for Civilians in Conflict expressed concerns, saying that America is responsible for ensuring that \"its assistance does not contribute to devastating civilian harm and possible violations of international humanitarian law\". Foreign Policy reported on a \"groundswell of opposition\" among US diplomats and national security officials, against what they perceived as Biden's \"blank check\" for the Israeli counterattack. \"More than 630 employees\" of the US Agency for International Development signed a letter calling for an \"immediate ceasefire\". US State Department official Josh Paul, who spent more than 11 years as the director of congressional and public affairs at the bureau overseeing arms transfers to foreign nations, resigned in protest at the US government's decision to send weapons to Israel.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of the United States Navy's Carrier Strike Group 12\u2014led by the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, and supported by the cruiser USS Normandy and the destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney, and USS Roosevelt\u2014to the Eastern Mediterranean. The United States Air Force augmented its F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter squadrons in the region, reportedly to deter other actors from entering the conflict.\n\nOn 15 October, it was reported that a US naval strike group composed of the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, the guided missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the guided missile destroyers USS Laboon, USS Mason and USS Gravely was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean. Austin also ordered that approximately 2,000 troops be prepared for possible deployment to Israel, according to several defense officials.\n\nOn 17 October, it was reported that a US naval group consisting of the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan, the amphibious transport dock USS Mesa Verde and the dock landing ship USS Carter Hall, was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea to transport the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit in case they were needed in the area.\nThe USS Dwight D.

Jan Egeland, the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said on 5 December that \"The pulverising of Gaza now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age.

Legal and genocide experts have condemned the attack, during which 1,139 people were killed, including 695 Israeli civilians. They argue that these actions by Hamas constitute a significant violation of international law and were carried out with the intent to destroy the Israeli national group. Some commentators highlight Hamas's founding charter, which calls for the destruction of Israel; this has led to suggestions that its intent is genocidal and that the attacks on 7 October were an attempt to fulfill this agenda.\n\nIn a 12 October preliminary legal assessment condemning Hamas's attacks in Israel, international humanitarian law scholar and Dean of Cornell Law School Jens David Ohlin said the evidence suggested Hamas's \"killings and kidnappings\" potentially violated Articles 6\u20138 of the Rome Statute as well as the Genocide Convention and were \"crimes against humanity\"; over a hundred international scholars expressed support for this position.\nSexual and gender-based violence\nMain article: Sexual and gender-based violence in the 7 October attack on Israel\n\nDuring the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities, Israeli women and girls were reportedly raped, assaulted, and mutilated by Hamas militants, an allegation that Hamas denies. In the months following the attacks, The Wall Street Journal reported on 21 December, there was \"mounting evidence of sexual violence, based on survivor accounts, first responders and witnesses.\" A two-month New York Times investigation, released in late December 2023, found at least seven locations where sexual assaults and mutilations of Israeli women and girls were carried out. It concluded that these were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence during the 7 October massacres. The probe was based on video footage, photographs, GPS data from mobile phones and interviews with more than 150 people. The newspaper's probe concluded that Hamas \"weaponized sexual violence\" during the attacks. Israeli police said dozens of women and some men were raped. The New York Times reported that \"videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers.\"\n\nThese acts were denounced as gender-based violence, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, aligning with the International Criminal Court's recognition of sexual violence as such."]}, {"query": "Which countries voted in favor, against, or abstained in the United Nations General Assembly resolution ES-10/21 calling for an \"immediate and sustained\" humanitarian truce and cessation of hostilities, and which countries were absent or non-members during the vote?", "response": "\n\nCountries that voted in favor: 153\n\nCountries that voted against: 23\n\nCountries that abstained: 10\n\nCountries that were absent or non-members during the vote: 3 (Argentina, India, and the United States)", "contexts": ["The leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Yahya Sinwar, said the group was prepared to release all Israeli hostages in return for the release of all Palestinian prisoners.

The Russian draft was rejected while negotiations continued on a Brazilian draft resolution.\n\nOn 18 October, the United States vetoed a UNSC resolution that \"condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, called for humanitarian pauses in all attacks to allow the delivery of lifesaving aid to civilians, and called for Israel to withdraw its directive for civilians to evacuate the northern part of the Gaza Strip\". The UNSC resolution, sponsored by Brazil and supported by 12 of the 15 Council members, calling for \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to Gazan civilians. The UK and Russia abstained. Louis Charbonneau at Human Rights Watch said the US had again \"cynically used their veto to prevent the UNSC from acting on Israel and Palestine at a time of unprecedented carnage\". The US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, explained that the US wanted more time to let American on-the-ground diplomacy \"play out\", and criticized the text for failing to mention Israel's right to self-defense, in line with the UN Charter \u2013 a point echoed by UK Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward. Subsequently, on 25 October, China and Russia vetoed a US drafted resolution and a Russian drafted resolution was vetoed by the UK and US.\n\nOn 15 November, the UNSC passed a resolution focusing on the humanitarian situation, calling for the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas and for urgent and extended humanitarian corridors throughout Gaza to save and protect civilian lives. Malta drafted the resolution; twelve members voted in favor, none against and three abstained. The United Kingdom and United States abstained, while they supported the emphasis on humanitarian relief, because it contained no explicit criticism of Hamas. Russia abstained because it did not call for an immediate ceasefire. The resolution followed four unsuccessful efforts the previous month, and a United Nations General Assembly Resolution calling for a cessation of hostilities on 27 October.\n\nWorld leaders, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and United Nations officials criticized the US for its veto on 8 December of a UNSC resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The UK abstained while the remaining 13 members of the council voted in favor. In response to the US veto, Egypt invoked Resolution 377A, which allows the UN General Assembly to address an issue threatening global security neglected by the UNSC.\nAmbassador recalls\n\nOn the afternoon of Israel's 31 October airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp, Bolivia severed all diplomatic ties with Israel, followed by a series of ambassador recalls by Chile and Colombia hours later, Jordan on 1 November, Bahrain on 2 November, Honduras on 3 November, Turkey on 4 November, Chad on 5 November, South Africa on 6 November, and Belize on 14 November.

This fire, which is being fought and has affected approximately 150 hectares (370 acres), is characterized by its proximity to populated areas, extreme fire behavior, including flying sparks and erratic winds. Until that time, a brigade from the Conaf is working at the site. On 3 January at 8:48 p.m. the alert was canceled after the fire was declared under control.[40]\nAraucan\u00eda Region\n\nOn 3 February, authorities declared a Red Alert for the commune of Galvarino in response to the \"Colonia Suiza\" and \"Nilpe 4\" forest fires. The \"Colonia Suiza\" fire affected 15 hectares while the \"Nilpe 4\" fire affected 5 hectares (12 acres).[41]\nLos Lagos Region\n\nOn 26 January, a forest fire began in the Los Lagos Region, which led authorities to declare a Yellow Alert after the \"Camino San Antonio\" fire was detected in Puerto Montt, initially affecting 6 hectares (15 acres). The situation quickly worsened, leading to the declaration of a Red Alert on the same day, at 8:36 p.m., in response to the growth of the fire to 63 hectares (160 acres) and its continued proximity to populated areas. This declaration mobilized an expanded set of resources, including Conaf brigades, firefighters from various locations, helicopters, and specialized machinery, to fight the fire effectively and protect the communities at risk.[42]\n\nIn the following days, the Red Alert was maintained, reflecting the persistent severity of the fire, which consumed 546 hectares (1,350 acres) and then increased to 804 hectares (1,990 acres). During this period, preventive evacuations were carried out: on the morning of 28 January 74 people were evacuated from 19 homes in the affected sectors, who returned to their homes in the afternoon of the same day. In addition, temporary shelters were set up and technical tables were held to coordinate the response to the fire.[42]\n\nThe operations included the active participation of firefighters, Conaf brigades, technicians, helicopters managed by both Conaf and Senapred, and the use of highway machinery and private resources. The joint effort between different entities allowed the fire to be fought with a combination of ground and air strategies, including the use of Hercules C-130 aircraft for extinguishing operations. In addition, attention was paid to the safety of brigade members and the well-being of those affected by the fire, with the implementation of evacuation measures and the provision of temporary accommodation for those displaced from their homes.[42]\nCasualties and damage\n\nA total of 131 people were killed in the fires, of whom 35 have been identified so far. The Chilean Forensic Medical Service said many bodies were found to be in bad condition and difficult to identify, prompting them to take DNA samples from people with missing relatives.[43] At least 45 of the dead were found at the scene, while six others died of burn injuries in medical facilities.

The RSF perpetrated mass killings, mass rapes, pillage, torture, and destruction of villages and were accused of committing ethnic cleansing against the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa. Leaders of the RSF have been indicted for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC), but Hemedti was not personally implicated in the 2003\u20132004 atrocities. In 2017, a new law gave the RSF the status of an \"independent security force\". Hemedti received several gold mines in Darfur as patronage from al-Bashir, and his personal wealth grew substantially. Bashir sent RSF forces to quash a 2013 uprising in South Darfur and deployed RSF units to fight in Yemen and Libya. During this time, the RSF developed a working relationship with the Russian private military outfit Wagner Group. These developments ensured that RSF forces grew into the tens of thousands and came to possess thousands of armed pickup trucks which regularly patrolled the streets of Khartoum. The Bashir regime allowed the RSF and other armed groups to proliferate to prevent threats to its security from within the armed forces, a practice known as \"coup-proofing\".\nPolitical transition\nMain article: Sudanese transition to democracy\nChairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.\nCommander of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.\n\nIn December 2018, protests against al-Bashir's regime began, starting the first phase of the Sudanese Revolution. Eight months of sustained civil disobedience were met with violent repression. In April 2019, the military (including the RSF) ousted al-Bashir in a coup d'\u00e9tat, ending his three decades of rule; the army established the Transitional Military Council, a junta. Bashir was imprisoned in Khartoum; he was not turned over to the ICC, which had issued warrants for his arrest on charges of war crimes. Protests calling for civilian rule continued; in June 2019, the RSF perpetrated the Khartoum massacre, in which more than a hundred demonstrators were killed and dozens were raped. Hemedti denied orchestrating the attack.\n\nIn August 2019, in response to international pressure and mediation by the African Union and Ethiopia, the military agreed to share power in an interim joint civilian-military unity government (the Transitional Sovereignty Council), headed by a civilian Prime Minister, Abdalla Hamdok, with elections to be held in 2023. In October 2021, the military seized power in a coup led by Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Hemedti. The Transitional Sovereignty Council was reconstituted as a new military junta led by al-Burhan, monopolizing power and halting Sudan's transition to democracy.\nOrigins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement (or Army; SLM, SLA, or SLM/A) is a rebel group active in Darfur, primarily composed of members of non-Arab ethnic groups and established in response to their marginalization by the Bashir regime. Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the Darfur Peace Agreement, with some factions joining the government in Khartoum. By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour. The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur had refused to sign and kept fighting.\n\nThe SPLM-N was founded by units of the predominantly South Sudanese Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army stationed in areas that remained in Sudan following the South Sudanese vote for independence in 2011. These forces then led a rebellion in the southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile a few months later.", "In July, a Masalit tribal leader claimed that more than 10,000 people had been killed in West Darfur alone, and that 80% of Geneina's residents had fled.\n\nMassacres were recorded in towns such as Tawila and Misterei, while a mass grave was discovered in Geneina containing the bodies of 87 people killed in clashes. Several intellectuals, politicians, professionals and nobility were assassinated. Most of these atrocities were blamed on the RSF and allied Arab militias. The UK government, witnesses and other observers described the violence in the region as tantamount to ethnic cleansing or even genocide, with non-Arab groups such as the Masalit being the primary victims. Mujeebelrahman Yagoub, Assistant Commissioner for Refugees in West Darfur called the violence worse than the War in Darfur in 2003 and the Rwandan genocide in 1994.\nSexual violence\nMain article: War crimes during the War in Sudan (2023\u2013present) \u00a7 Sexual violence\n\nIn July, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF. NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400. Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating.\nCasualties among humanitarian workers\n\nIn the Battle of Kabkabiya, three employees of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed after being caught in the crossfire at a military base. Two other staff members were injured. On 18 April, the EU's top humanitarian aid officer in Sudan, Wim Fransen of Belgium, was shot and injured in Khartoum. On 21 April, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that one of its local employees was killed in a crossfire while traveling with his family near El-Obeid. On 20 July, an 18-member team of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res was attacked while transporting supplies to the Turkish Hospital in south Khartoum. By then, the World Health Organization had verified 51 attacks on medical facilities and personnel since the conflict began, resulting in 10 deaths and 24 injuries. On 25 July, Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said 18 aid workers had been killed and over two dozen others were detained or unaccounted for. The conflict has led the United Nations to declare Sudan the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarian workers after South Sudan.\n\nThe situation was further compounded by attacks on humanitarian facilities, with more than 50 warehouses looted, 82 offices ransacked, and over 200 vehicles stolen. One particularly devastating looting incident in El Obeid in early June resulted in the loss of food \"that could have fed 4.4 million people\".\nAttacks on journalists\n\nThe SAF and RSF are accused of threatening, attacking, and killing journalists during the conflict. The Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documented over 40 violations in May alone. Several journalists were injured or killed, and 13 newspapers ceased operations. Humanitarian workers were also targeted, with 18 killed and many others detained.\n\nMedia organizations accused both the SAF and the RSF of threatening, attacking and even killing several journalists during the conflict, with the Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documenting more than 40 such violations during the second half of May alone. Aside from the occupation of state media channels, the RSF raided the offices of the newspapers El Hirak El Siyasi, El Madaniya and the Sudanese Communist Party's El Midan and shot and injured photojournalists Faiz Abubakr, and Ali Shata, while the SAF was accused of circulating lists of journalists it accused of supporting the RSF.\n\nBBC journalist Mohamed Othman was reportedly attacked and beaten in Khartoum while a correspondent and cameramen for the El Sharg news outlet were detained for hours near Merowe airport on the first day of the fighting on 15 April. On 16 June, Al Jazeera journalists Osama Sayed Ahmed and Ahmed El Buseili were shot by snipers in Khartoum, while the RSF detained two of the channel's other reporters, Ahmed Fadl and Rashid Gibril, in Khartoum on 16 May, and subsequently looted Fadl's residence.

The Persian army had little difficulty in defeating him. Once again Baluch political unity proved highly brittle. D\u016bst-Mo\u1e25ammad eventually surrendered and was pardoned on condition he live in Tehran. After a year, he escaped while on a hunting trip. In due course, he was recaptured, and having killed his guard in the escape was hanged for murder. Baloch activists complained that the new governance was centralised and dominated by the Persians, \"forcing the Baloch community and other minorities to fight to protect their rights.\"\n\nBaloch people in Iran have several grievances. The Shi'ite Islamic revolution perceived the predominantly Sunni Baloch as a \"threat\". Sistan-e-Balochistan, the province where Baloch have traditionally lived in Iran, has the country's worst rates for life expectancy, adult literacy, primary school enrolment, access to improved water sources and sanitation, infant mortality rate, of any province in Iran. Despite its important natural resources (gas, gold, copper, oil and uranium), the province has the lowest per capita income in Iran. Almost 80% of the Baloch live under the poverty line.\nAttacks by insurgents\n\nIn the early 2000s the radical Islamist group Jundallah became active in Balochistan. The al Qaeda-linked extremist organisation has branches in both Iran and Pakistan. From 2003 to 2012, an estimated 296 people were killed in Jundullah-related violence in Iran. Attacks in Iran included bombings in Zahedan in 2007, which killed 18 people, and another bombing in 2009 that killed 20 people. In 2009, 43 people were killed in a bombing in Pishin. In July 2010, 27 people were killed in bombings in Zahedan. In 2010, a suicide bombing in Chabahar killed 38 people.\n\nAmong the deaths in the Pishin bombings were two Iranian Revolutionary Guards generals: Noor Ali Shooshtari, the deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guards' ground forces, and Rajab Ali Mhammadzadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' Sistan and Baluchistan provincial commander.\n\nIn 2010 the leader of Jundallah, Abdolmalek Rigi, was killed, causing fragmentation of the group but not an end to insurgent attacks. In October 2013, the group Jaish al-Adl (JAA, Army of Justice), killed 14 Iranian border guards in an ambush in the town of Rustak, near the town of Saravan. Shortly thereafter, the Iranian authorities executed 16 Balochs, on charges ranging from terrorism to drug trafficking. Another group, Harakat Ansar Iran (Partisan Movement of Iran, HAI) killed two Basij officers and wounded numerous civilians in an October 2012 suicide bombing against the mosque of Imam Hussein, in the port city of Chabahar (Sistan and Baluchestan Province).\n\nAccording to analyst Daniele Grassi, \"Salafism plays an increasingly central role\" for the \"post-Jundallah\" militants of JAA and HAI. \"The rhetoric of groups such as HAI and JAA uses strongly anti-Shia tones. The two groups often refer to the Iranian Islamic Republic as a Safavid regime, in reference to the Safavid dynasty which introduced Shiism in Iran.\" Iran is also concerned about anti-Shia co-operation between the two groups and ISIS.\n\nIran has accused America of supporting Jundallah \"for years\". The US government, which has officially designated Jundallah a terrorist organisation, has denied this charge. Iran has been angered by JAA's use of Pakistani territory as a refuge, and has threatened military operations in Pakistan to counter insurgent groups \"on several occasions\".\nImpact on Iran-Pakistan Relations\nSee also: Iran\u2013Pakistan relations\nFurther information: Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar, 2024 Iranian missile strikes in Pakistan, and 2024 Iran\u2013Pakistan border skirmishes\n\nRelations between Iran and Pakistan are generally peaceful, but accusations of harboring Baloch militants have stoked distrust on both sides.\n\nIn January 2024, the Iranian and Pakistani militaries successively attacked separatist targets in border areas. Iran's missile strikes and Pakistan's operation stoke regional tensions.\nDrivers of insurgency\n\nIn Balochistan, Pakistan, \"drivers\" of insurgency have been economic, cultural, involving immigration and human rights.", "Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a 40-page report which criticised Baloch nationalists of killing, threatening and harassing teachers. Human Right Watch (HRW) has also held separatist responsible for attacks on schools across the province. Another factor which limits the scope of nationalist insurgency is the lack of support from locals as majority of locals don't support separatist groups. Locals support political parties who use legislature to address their grievances.\nHuman rights issues\nMain article: Human rights violations in Balochistan\n\nHuman Right Organisations have held Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) responsible for ethnic cleansing in the province as Brahamdagh Bugti (alleged leader of BLA), during a TV interview on 15 April 2009, urged separatists to kill non-Baloch residing in Balochistan. His actions allegedly lead to the death of 500 non-Baloch citizens in the province. According to The Economist around 800 non-Baloch settlers and Baloch have been killed by Baloch militant groups since 2006. Similarly, Human Right Watch have also held Baloch militants groups like Baloch liberation army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation United Front (BLUF) to be responsible for attacks on schools, teachers and students in the province. As a result, many teachers have sought transfer to secure areas such as Quetta or have moved out of province entirely. Separatist militants groups have also claimed responsibility for attacking and killing Journalists in the province. Apart from Human Right Organisations, Baloch separatists themselves have accused each other of being involved in Human right violations.\n\nIn the period 2003 to 2012, it is estimated that 8000 people were abducted by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan. In 2008 alone, more than 1100 Baloch people disappeared. There have also been reports of torture. An increasing number of bodies \"with burn marks, broken limbs, nails pulled out, and sometimes with holes drilled in their heads\" are being found on roadsides as the result of a \"kill and dump\" campaign allegedly conducted by Pakistani security forces, particularly Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Frontier Corps (FC). A 2013 report from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan identified ISI and Frontier Corps as the perpetrators for many disappearances, while noting a more cooperative stance from these agencies in recent years as perceived by local police forces. The Pakistan Rangers are also alleged to have committed a vast number of human rights violations in the region. No one has been held responsible for the crimes. However, Pakistani security officials have rejected all the allegations made against them. Major General Obaid Ullah Khan claim that Baloch militants are using Frontier Corps (FC) uniform to kidnap people and malign the good name of Frontier Corps. Baloch militants have also been found using military uniform which resembles the one used by Frontier Corps while carrying out their activities. A senior Pakistani provincial security official claims that missing person figures are 'exaggerated', that 'in Balochistan, insurgents, immigrants who fled to Europe and even those who have been killed in military operations are declared as missing persons'. Reports have shown that many people have fled the province to seek asylum in other countries because of the unrest caused by separatist militants.\n\nMilitant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi have systematically targeted Shia Muslims in Balochistan, with about 600 being killed in attacks in recent years.\n\nDuring a camp at Broken Chair, Geneva, Baloch Republican Party (BRP) leader Sher Baz Bugti alleged that Baloch youth, women and children were kept in \"torture cells\". BRP chief Brahumdagh Bugti called upon human rights organisation, including the United Nations, to take steps to stop the alleged \"Baloch genocide\".\nSunni extremism and religious persecution of Zikris\n\nThe activities of terrorist organisations such as Lashkar-i-Jhangvi and Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, have produced a surge in religious extremism in Balochistan. Hindus, Shias (including Hazaras) and Zikris have been targeted, resulting in the migration of over 300,000 of them from Baluchistan.\n\nBaloch Liberation Front (BLF) and Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) have also targeted Zikris in the province."]}, {"query": "Which Sudanese cities, specifically mentioning Dalang, Muglad, Babanusa, and Omdurman, experienced significant fighting between the RSF and SAF in January 2024, and which Sudanese state, West Kordofan, was the focus of the RSF's consolidation efforts in Gezira State during the same month?", "response": "\n\n* Significant fighting occurred in January 2024 between the RSF and SAF in the following Sudanese cities: Dalang, Muglad, Babanusa, and Omdurman.\n* West Kordofan was the focus of the RSF's consolidation efforts in Gezira State during the same month.", "contexts": ["Burhan also accused African leaders of complicity of atrocities against Sudanese civilians. His reaction was regarded by observers as isolating Sudan politically and straining the latest peace efforts.\nFighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nAs 2024 began the RSF made attacks into South Kordofan, defeating SAF forces in the town of Habila in the Nuba Mountains and pushing towards Dalang. On 7 January the RSF attacked SAF positions in Dalang, meeting fierce resistance from the army and civilian militias. During the fighting the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) entered the city, taking control of several neighbourhoods. SPLM-N forces proceeded to attack the RSF, and the paramilitary retreated from the city. RSF fighters withdrawing from Dalang entered the city of Muglad in West Kordofan, easily taking control as the city had no organised SAF presence. West Kordofan had been relatively free of fighting for several months due to a local truce brokered by leaders of the Messiria tribe, but as tensions began to escalate rumours spread that the RSF was planning an attack on the encircled city of Babanusa and the SAF 22nd Infantry Division garrisoning it.\n\nIn January 2024, the RSF focused on consolidating its gains in Gezira State. Fighting was reported on 17 January east of Al-Managal, the last major town not under RSF control. The SAF delivered weapons to the city by helicopter, including selectively distributing them among civilians in the town, attempting to bolster its defenses. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) selectively recruited and armed civilians based on perceived loyalty.\n\nOn 24 January 2024, the RSF launched an attack on Babanusa after encircling the city for months. By 25 January, the RSF gained control of the city center and entered the headquarters of the 22nd infantry division.\nSAF gains in Omdurman\n\nThe SAF gained ground in Omdurman in 2024, attacking from two directions to try to link up their forces in the northern part of the city with a besieged force in the city centre. The Omdurman front is the only area in Sudan where the SAF has carried out a sustained offensive operation, and defeating the RSF at Omdurman would represent its first major breakthrough of the war.\nCasualties\nFurther information: War crimes during the War in Sudan (2023\u2013present)\n\nAs of January 2024, around 13,000\u201315,000 people had been killed and 33,000 others injured, according to the UN. The Sultanate of Dar Masalit claimed on 20 June that more than 5,000 people were killed and about 8,000 were wounded in fighting in West Darfur alone, while a Masalit tribal leader told the Sudanese news outlet Ayin Network on 22 July that more than 10,000 people had been killed in the state. On 12 June, the Sudan Doctors Syndicate said at least 959 civilians had been killed and 4,750 others were injured. On 15 August, the UN said that at least 435 children had been killed in the conflict. Doctors on the ground warned that stated figures do not include all casualties as people could not reach hospitals due to difficulties in movement. A spokesperson for the Sudanese Red Crescent was quoted as saying that the number of casualties \"was not small\".

Fighting has been concentrated around the capital city of Khartoum and the Darfur region. As of 21 January 2024, at least 13,000\u201315,000 people had been killed and 33,000 others were injured. As of 29 December 2023, over 5.8 million were internally displaced and more than 1.5 million others had fled the country as refugees, and many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the 2023 Masalit massacres.\n\nThe war began with attacks by the RSF on government sites as airstrikes, artillery, and gunfire were reported across Sudan. The cities of Khartoum and Omdurman were divided between the two warring factions, with al-Burhan relocating his government to Port Sudan as RSF forces captured most of Khartoum's government buildings. Attempts by international powers to negotiate a ceasefire culminated in the Treaty of Jeddah, which did not stop the fighting and was abandoned as ineffective.\n\nOver the next few months a stalemate eventuated, during which the two sides were then joined by rebel groups who had previously fought against Sudan's government. By mid-November the Minni Minnawi and Mustafa Tambour factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement had officially joined the war in support of the SAF, alongside the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). In contrast the Tamazuj movement joined forces with the RSF, while the Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement\u2013North attacked SAF positions in the south of the country.\n\nStarting in October, momentum began to swing towards the RSF once more, as the paramilitary defeated army forces in Darfur and made gains in Khartoum State, Kordofan, and Gezira State. Further negotiations between the warring sides have so far produced no significant results, while many countries have provided military or political support for either al-Burhan or Hemedti.\nBackground\nMain article: History of Sudan\n\nThe history of conflicts in Sudan has consisted of foreign invasions and resistance, ethnic tensions, religious disputes, and disputes over resources. Two civil wars between the central government and the southern regions killed 1.5 million people, and a conflict in the western region of Darfur displaced two million people and killed more than 200,000 others. Since independence in 1956, Sudan has experienced more than 15 military coups and it has been ruled by the military for the majority of that time, interspersed with periods of democratic parliamentary rule.\nWar in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nBy the turn of the 21st century, Sudan's western Darfur region had endured prolonged instability and social strife due to a combination of racial and ethnic tensions and disputes over land and water. In 2003, this situation erupted into a full-scale rebellion against government rule, against which president and military strongman Omar al-Bashir vowed to use forceful action. The resulting War in Darfur was marked by widespread state-sponsored acts of violence, leading to charges of war crimes and genocide against al-Bashir. The initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300,000 dead and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced; even though the intensity of the violence later declined, the situation in the region remained far from peaceful.\n\nTo crush uprisings by non-Arab tribes in the Nuba Mountains, al-Bashir relied upon the Janjaweed, a collection of Arab militias which was drawn from camel-trading tribes which were active in Darfur and portions of Chad. In 2013, al-Bashir announced that the Janjaweed would be reorganized as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and he also announced that the RSF would be placed under the command of the Janjaweed's commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, more commonly known as Hemedti. The RSF perpetrated mass killings, mass rapes, pillage, torture, and destruction of villages and were accused of committing ethnic cleansing against the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa. Leaders of the RSF have been indicted for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC), but Hemedti was not personally implicated in the 2003\u20132004 atrocities.

Although unreasonableness has its origins in British jurisprudence, the court has expanded on this doctrine since Israel's founding in 1948. Some have claimed that the courts' definition of the grounds of reasonableness is unique globally. An unreasonable administrative action has been defined as a situation in which the administrative authority failed to give proper weight to all relevant considerations which formed the basis of the administrative decision, and did not properly balance between all the relevant considerations, in accordance with their weight:\n\n    The only way to further the discussion about the substance of reasonableness is to recognize that reasonableness is neither a physical nor a metaphysical concept, but a normative one. Reasonableness means that one identifies the relevant considerations and then balances them according to their weight. Indeed, reasonableness is an evaluative process, not a descriptive process. It is not a concept that is defined by deductive logic. It is not merely rationality. A decision is reasonable if it was made by weighing the necessary considerations, including fundamental values in general and human rights in particular. Nothing is reasonable 'in itself'.\n\nThis expansive doctrine empowers the Supreme Court to strike down almost any administrative decision, even if it was taken by due legal authority. In an interview with Haaretz, former Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau criticized the use of the \"unreasonableness\" doctrine:\n\n    The justices in the older court did not set themselves up as the teachers of the generation. We did not think that our task was to teach the public fundamental or deep values of private or public morality. This doesn't mean that we didn't pay attention to values. This doesn't mean that we didn't make value judgements. But we understood the limitations of the Court's jurisdiction. We made sure that what we ruled on regarding values flowed out of the issue brought before us [...] The judge is not the teacher of the generation and is not a philosopher-king. His task is much more modest: to be a faithful interpreter of the law. Of the public's will as expressed by the Knesset, as representative of the public. Therefore, I believe that the judge's wisdom requires him to be cautious, sensitive, with broad discretion and without hubris.\n\nArguments against the reform\n\nAmir Fuchs, a lecturer in the Politics and Communication Department at the School of Government and Social Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, has argued in favor of the reasonableness doctrine, saying that \"its purpose is to prevent the government from passing entirely arbitrary decisions; but it is certainly not intended to replace the decision-making powers of the government, with those of the court. Like all other administrative law standards (the rules of natural justice, and standards such as the ban on extraneous interests and the requirement to take all relevant considerations into account), it is meant to ensure that the government does not exceed the boundaries of its law-given authority.\"\n\nYedidia Stern, former dean of the Law Faculty at Bar Ilan University, has defended the reasonableness doctrine, stating that without it, \"the members of the outgoing Knesset will have the power to make the final decision about who can run against them in the next election. Without judicial review they will be able to protect one another through the mechanism of parliamentary immunity.\"\n\nRuvi Ziegler, the programme director for Master of Laws in International Law, Human Rights and Advanced Legal Studies at the University of Reading, has written that \"the plan would strip courts of their power to hold the Executive properly accountable for its administrative decisions. This means decisions made by public authorities from the police to the tax authority, would no longer need to be considered \"reasonable\" to be accepted in judicial review. In practical terms this means anyone could be denied a license, a benefit, a service without being given suitable reasons and without having an effective remedy. The \"reasonableness\" standard, which is a key part of British legal heritage, is critical for good governance and must be maintained in the Israeli setting as well.\"", "The proposed changes seek to change the composition of the committee, giving a majority of votes to the government and thus giving the government control over the selection and dismissal of all judges, including of the Supreme Court.\n    Judicial review \u2014 The proposed changes seek to curb judicial review over legislation, including by explicitly legislating against the Supreme Court's exercise of judicial review of Basic Laws, and requiring a full bench of Supreme Court justices to preside over any case in which the legality of regular legislation passed by the Knesset is evaluated, and 80% of them to rule for invalidation of such legislation.\n    Knesset override \u2014 The proposed changes seek to allow the Knesset to overrule a decision by the Supreme Court on the legality of legislation, where the Knesset votes with a majority (of 61, out of 120 Knesset members) against the court decision.\n    Legal advisers to government ministries \u2014 The proposed changes seek to reclassify ministry legal advisers from independent authorities, subject to the professional oversight of the Justice Ministry, to politically selected counsel whose opinions are explicitly non-binding upon the government and its ministers, thus allowing ministers to individually select and dismiss their legal advisors and decide whether or not to adhere to legal advice.\n    Reasonableness \u2014 The proposed changes seek to limit the scope of judicial review of governmental and administrative decisions, by legislating against the concept of 'reasonableness'. This would preclude the courts from hearing petitions or appeals against governmental and administrative decisions on the basis that such decisions are 'unreasonable'.\n\nOn 24 July 2023, the Knesset passed the law curbing judicial review of reasonableness.\nHCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v.

At the end of December 2023, Israeli television station Keshet 12 reported the ruling in advance based on a leaked draft of the decision. The bill was struck down by the Supreme Court, in its role as the High Court of Justice, on 1 January 2024 by a vote of 8\u20137. The justices also ruled 12\u20133 that the court has the power to overturn Basic Laws.\n\nEach justice wrote their own opinion. Justice Hayut noted Israel's \"fragile, lacking system of checks and balances\" in finding that the reform was unreasonable; Amit echoed the \"heavy democratic deficit in Israel\", saying that \"such a cancellation of the reasonableness doctrine has much greater weight here than in other countries\". Justice Stein agreed in upholding the court's ability to strike down laws, writing that \"the Knesset never received the authority to pass any law it pleased\", but voted with the minority in favor of the proposed reform, finding that it \"violates no constitutional norm\". Sohlberg, meanwhile, wrote that \"frail legal constructs\" did not mean the court could overrule the Knesset.\nProposed changes\nJudicial selection\nCurrent system\n\nThe Judicial Selection Committee is composed of nine members. Three of them are Supreme Court judges, two are representatives of the Bar Association, two are Knesset members and two are ministers. Selection of judges to all courts require a simple majority of the committee, but selection of Supreme Court judges require the approval of seven out of the nine members on the committee, granting essentially veto powers to either the three judges or the representatives of the ruling Parliamentary coalition.\n\nAccording to the Israel Democracy Institute, the effect of the current system is one of consensus, in that \"the selection of Supreme Court justices has mandated the consent of the politicians on the [Committee], because a majority of seven of its nine members must support a successful candidate. By the same token, the politicians cannot select judges without the agreement of the justices on the committee. This principle has generally produced a consensus on a slate of new justices.\""]}, {"query": "Which historical figure, depicted in the 2023 film \"Napoleon\" directed by Ridley Scott, successfully stormed the city of Toulon in 1793 and repelled the British ships with artillery?", "response": "Paul Barras", "contexts": ["Napoleon is a 2023 epic historical drama film directed and produced by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa.

The Directory criticises him for abandoning his troops, but he condemns them for their poor leadership of France and, alongside several collaborators such as Talleyrand, Fouch\u00e9, Siey\u00e8s and Ducos, overthrows them in a coup and becomes First Consul.\n\nNapoleon is crowned Emperor of the French by the pope in 1804, during which he audaciously puts the crown on his own head. Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggests to Austria an alliance, though the Austrians dismiss the idea. A year later, Napoleon outmanoeuvres and defeats the Austrians and Russians at the Battle of Austerlitz, forcing them to retreat over frozen lakes before bombarding the ice and drowning them. Afterwards, he invites Austrian Emperor Francis II for wine\u2014which Russian Tsar Alexander I declines to attend\u2014and tells Francis that since he did not totally destroy their armies, he expects the latter to be grateful.\n\nNapoleon's mother has him impregnate a mistress, proving that Jos\u00e9phine is infertile. He divorces her in 1810, publicly slapping her in the face when she initially refuses to read her portion of the decree, but the two remain on good terms and continue exchanging friendly letters. Napoleon marries Marie Louise of Austria, who bears a son one year later.\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon invades Russia after Alexander reneges on a peace treaty with France. He prevails, despite bloody guerrilla resistance by Don Cossack forces, at the Battle of Borodino, but finds Moscow empty and later set aflame.

It stated that Israel's judiciary, mainly its Supreme Court, has regularly upheld policies, practices and laws that helped enforce \"Israel's system of apartheid against Palestinians\". The article named examples of the role the Supreme Court played against Palestinians: upholding administrative detentions, green-lighting the destruction of villages, upholding a law imposing restrictions on family reunification. Amnesty argued that the Supreme Court intervened in protecting Palestinian human rights on few occasions, but if the institution loses power to the government, even this \"slim and inconsistent\" protection would disappear.\n\nAn article by former United States ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk and former Jordanian United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid bin Ra'ad in Foreign Policy argued that the insistence of Israeli right-wing Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on curbing the powers of the Supreme Court, stems from a desire to \"more easily enact his vision of an Israel that extends unimpeded from river to sea,\" as the court had previously impeded the legalization of Israeli settlements built on privately-owned Palestinian land.", "The 2023 Israeli judicial reform is a set of five changes to the judicial system and the balance of powers in Israel that was proposed in January 2023. The intent of the measures is to curb the judiciary's influence over lawmaking and public policy by limiting the Supreme Court's power to exercise judicial review, granting the government control over judicial appointments and limiting the authority of its legal advisors. The effort was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Yariv Levin and the Chair of the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, Simcha Rothman.\n\nThe Supreme Court has, for several decades, assumed the right to declare Knesset legislation unconstitutional. The reform would permit the Knesset to override such a ruling by reintroducing the legislation and approving it with a majority of Knesset members. The reform would additionally diminish the ability of courts to conduct judicial review of the Basic Laws and change the makeup of the Judicial Selection Committee, so that control over the appointment of judges is effectively given to the government.\n\nLevin and the ruling government coalition have stated that the above is the first step in their judicial reform, and that additional steps are planned, including changing the appointment process of legal advisors to government ministries, such that they are appointed and dismissed by the ministers; making their legal advice a recommendation rather than binding on the ministers; and making them subordinate directly to the ministers rather than to the Justice Ministry's professional oversight. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that the reform is necessary because the judiciary has too much control over public policy, and a better balance is needed between democratically elected legislators and the judiciary. However, Netanyahu has been barred from actively taking part in the process of the judicial reform by the Attorney General, due to a conflict of interest stemming from his ongoing corruption trial.\n\nThe coalition is also advancing a number of other bills concerning Israel's judicial system and the balance of powers, including reforms to widen the authority of the Rabbinical Court, allowing them to act as arbitrators in civil matters using religious law, if both parties consent; bills limiting the ability to call for a no-confidence vote and other methods for dissolving a sitting Knesset; bills prohibiting criminal proceedings against sitting Prime Ministers; and bills permitting key public service positions to be positions of trust appointed by politicians rather than professional appointments.\n\nThe proposed reform has sparked significant backlash, as well as some support, both inside and outside of Israel. Opposition leaders and activists accused the government of undermining established norms of checks and balances and attempting to seize absolute power, with some arguing the reform amounts to an attempt at regime change. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, has called for the reforms to be halted to allow for a wider consultative process, and the president of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General have attested to the reform's illegalities. Protests against the reform escalated in Israel shortly after its introduction, as did significant concern among some in the international community.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, after public protests and general strikes, Netanyahu announced a pause in the reform process to allow for dialogue with opposition parties. However, negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise collapsed in June, and the government resumed its plans to unilaterally pass parts of the legislation. On 24 July 2023, the Knesset passed a bill that curbs the power of the Supreme Court to declare government decisions unreasonable; on 1 January 2024, the Supreme Court struck the bill down.\nBackground\nSee also: Thirty-seventh government of Israel \u00a7 Controversies\nDemonstrators against the judicial reform in Haifa, 11 January 2023.

The statement said the unity government would not promote any policy or laws except those related to the ongoing fighting with Hamas.

According to a survey of 668 respondents carried out by Palestinian research firm AWRAD in the beginning of November 2023, 47 percent of Gazans strongly supported the 7 October attack. The overwhelming majority of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank said they would never forget or forgive Israel's behavior in Gaza during the war. Another survey released on 13 December found that 57% of respondents in the Gaza Strip and 82% in the West Bank believed Hamas was correct in launching the 7 October attack, while only 10% said they believed Hamas committed war crimes during the conflict.

The Dash 8 was fitted with a Mode S-capable transponder but was reportedly not equipped with ADS-B; this meant the aircraft's position and speed were not reported by the aircraft itself and instead relied on multilateration by on-ground receivers.\nCollision\nAirport layout with the location of the runway collision and the wreckage of both aircraft.\nCoast Guard plane\n\nThe Japan Coast Guard aircraft, carrying six crew members, was preparing to bring supplies to an airbase in Niigata in response to the 2024 Noto earthquake, which had occurred the day before. It was one of four aircraft deployed by the government to provide help to the affected areas.\n\nThe aircraft was reported to be stationary on the runway for around 40 seconds before the collision. The captain reported that the back of the aircraft suddenly caught fire shortly after he had increased the engine power before exploding following the collision. He survived with serious injuries, while the five remaining crew members were confirmed dead by the Tokyo Fire Department.

They were unaware that a fire had broken out on board until they were informed by a cabin attendant that the left engine was on fire, and one of the pilots later said that he had seen an object that had caused him concern before the collision. However, the three pilots denied that they had visually confirmed the presence of the Coast Guard aircraft.\n\nWith the right engine still running, all 367 passengers and 12 crew members on board JAL516 evacuated through three of the plane's eight evacuation slides, located at doors 1L, 1R and 4L. JAL said the plane's in-flight announcement system had failed, leading the crew to give instructions through megaphones or by shouting. Forty-three foreign nationals and eight children were on board. Two pets, a dog and a cat, were checked in on board and died. Fourteen people on board suffered minor injuries, four of whom were taken to hospital. It was noted that no one exited with hand luggage, a factor that facilitated a smoother evacuation. Another factor cited in the survival of those on board was that the aircraft, one of the first commercial models to be made of composite carbon fibre materials, appeared to have withstood the initial impact of the collision and fire relatively well.

Sunni Islam is the predominant religion throughout the Balochistan region.\n\nStuart Notholt, in his Atlas of Ethnic Conflict, describes the unrest in Balochistan as a \"nationalist/self-determination conflict\".\nHistory\nBackground\n\nThe origins of the secessionist movement are believed to have started around the uncertainty regarding the Khanate of Kalat, established in 1666 by Mir Ahmad. The Khanate of Kalat occupied central portions of territory in present day Balochistan, and was one of the four princely states of the modern day province under British rule, namely Makran, Las Bela, Kharan and Kalat. Under Nasir I of Kalat in 1758, who accepted the Afghan paramountcy, the boundaries of Kalat stretched up to Dera Ghazi Khan in the east and Bandar Abbas in the west. However, in November 1839, the British invaded Kalat, and the Khan was killed in action during the invasion. Afterwards, the British influence in the region gradually grew. In 1869, the British Political Agent Robert Groves Sandeman ended up mediating a dispute between the Khan of Kalat and the Sardars of Balochistan, and established the British primacy in the region. The tribal areas of Marri, Bugti, Khetran and Chaghi were brought under the direct administration of a British Agent, eventually to become the Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan. Lasbela and Kharan were declared Special Areas with a different political system. The remaining areas of Sarawan, Jhalawan, Kacchi and Makran were retained as the Khanate of Kalat, supervised by a Political Agent of Kalat.\n\nIn the 20th century, the educated Baloch middle class harboured hopes of their independence from British colonial rule. They formed a nationalist movement Anjuman-e-Ittehad-e-Balochistan in 1931. One of their first campaigns was to fight for the accession of Azam Jan as the Khan of Kalat and a constitutional government to be established under him. They were successful in establishing Azam Jan as the Khan but the new Khan sided with the Sardars and turned his back on the Anjuman. His successor Mir Ahmad Yar Khan was more sympathetic to Anjuman but he was averse to upsetting his relations with the British. The Anujman, transformed into the Kalat State National Party (KSNP), continued to fight for independence from the British. It was declared illegal by the Khanate in 1939 and its active leaders and activists were exiled. This paved the way for the formation of new political parties, Balochistan Muslim League allied to the Muslim League in June 1939 and Anjuman-i-Watan allied to the Indian National Congress in the same year. Led by Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai, the Anjuman-i-Watan was opposed to the partition of India and wanted a united India after the country gained independence from Britain.\n\nDuring British rule Balochistan was under the rule of a Chief Commissioner and did not have the same status as other provinces of British India. The Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the period 1927-1947 strived to introduce reforms in Balochistan to bring it on par with other provinces of British India.\n\nDuring the time of the Indian independence movement, public opinion in Balochistan, at least in Quetta and other small towns in northern Balochistan, was overwhelmingly in favour of Pakistan. The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province's inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.\n\nThe Khan of Kalat lent great support to the Pakistan Movement but also desired to declare independence. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it clear that the princely states with the lapse of British paramountcy would have to join either India or Pakistan, keeping in mind their geographic and demographic compulsions.\n\nOn 19 July, Mountbatten called a Round Table Conference meeting between representatives of the State of Kalat and Government of Pakistan.

Mountbatten discussed with them the status of the Kalat State. The representatives of Kalat argued that Kalat, as per the treaty of 1876, was an independent and sovereign state and not an Indian state. Mountbatten accepted this position for the purpose of negotiation, although Kalat had always been a princely state. Thus, Mountbatten confined the topic of discussion to the leased areas of Quetta, Nushki, Nasirabad and Bolan. He explained that Pakistan rejected Kalat's claims that these areas should be returned to Kalat.\n\nPakistan's position was that it would inherit all treaty obligations incurred by India to the foreign states. Kalat argued that the leases clearly stated that the other party besides Kalat was the British Government alone. Kalat argued that it was a personal agreement and there was no provision that the leases to the British would be inherited by others. Therefore, since the agreement was between Kalat and the British Government, Pakistan could not be the latter's successor party.\n\nPakistan did not agree that the agreement was personal as personal agreements by nature implied that only a particular person was involved. Mountbatten also said that according to international law, treaties such as the one being discussed were inherited by successors and not invalidated by a transfer of power. Mountbatten also suggested that in case there was no agreement the matter could be put before an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nKalat wished to have further discussions on the matter. Kalat also argued that in case of a vote in the leased areas between joining Kalat and joining Pakistan then the vote would go in favour of the former. Pakistan did not agree that the vote would have such a result.\n\nKalat also expressed its deepest desire to remain on friendly terms with Pakistan and stated that it understood that Jinnah, who was anxious for a correct decision, wanted more time to study the issues between Kalat and Pakistan. Mountbatten, however, suggested that Jinnah not be brought into the discussions.\n\nMountbatten insisted that Kalat and Pakistan sign a standstill agreement, which both countries did. The Standstill Agreement also stipulated that both parties would discuss as soon as possible about their relationship concerning Defence and External Affairs. According to the Article I, 'The Government of Pakistan agrees that Kalat is an independent State, being quite different in status from other States of India'. However, the Article IV stated:\n\n    a standstill agreement will be made between Pakistan and Kalat by which Pakistan shall stand committed to all the responsibilities agreements signed by Kalat and the British Government from 1839 to 1947 and by this, Pakistan shall be the legal, constitutional and political successor of the British.\n\nThrough this agreement, the British Paramountcy was effectively transferred to Pakistan.\n\nHowever, without making any agreement with Pakistan and in violation of the Standstill Agreement the Khan of Kalat declared independence. Later on, the ruler of Kalat unconditionally signed an Instrument of Accession with Pakistan on 27 March 1948, contrary to the wishes of his state's legislature, being the last of all princely states to do so.\nFirst conflict\n\nBalochistan contained a Chief Commissioner's province and four princely states under the British Raj. The province's Shahi Jirga and the non-official members of the Quetta Municipality opted for Pakistan unanimously on 29 June 1947. Three of the princely states, Makran, Las Bela and Kharan, acceded to Pakistan in 1947 after independence. But the ruler of the fourth princely state, the Khan of Kalat, Ahmad Yar Khan, who used to call Jinnah his 'father', declared Kalat's independence as this was one of the options given to all of the 535 princely states by British Prime Minister Clement Attlee."]}, {"query": "Which Sudanese rebel groups, primarily composed of members of non-Arab ethnic groups, were active in Darfur and established in response to their marginalization by the Bashir regime?

By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour. The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur had refused to sign and kept fighting.\n\nThe SPLM-N was founded by units of the predominantly South Sudanese Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army stationed in areas that remained in Sudan following the South Sudanese vote for independence in 2011. These forces then led a rebellion in the southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile a few months later. In 2017, the SPLM-N split between a faction led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and one led by Malik Agar, with al-Hilu demanding secularism as a condition for peace while Agar did not agree with this. During the Sudanese Revolution, al-Hilu's faction declared an indefinite unilateral ceasefire. In 2020, a peace agreement was signed between the Sudanese government and Agar's faction, with Agar later joining the Transitional Sovereignty Council in Khartoum. Al-Hilu held out until he agreed to sign a separate peace agreement with the Sudanese government a few months after. Further steps to consolidate the agreement stalled following the 2021 coup, and the al-Hilu faction instead signed an agreement with the SLM-al-Nur and the Sudanese Communist Party, agreeing to co-operate in order to draft a 'revolutionary charter' and remove the military from power.\nPrelude\n\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak Sudanese economy steeply declined, fuelling wide protests demanding that the junta relinquish power back to civilian authorities. Tensions soon arose between the two junta leaders over al-Burhan's restoration to office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government. Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics. This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab. As a sign of the growing rift between him and al-Burhan, Hemedti expressed regret over the October 2021 coup.\n\nTensions between the RSF and the SAF began to escalate in February 2023, as the RSF began to recruit members from across Sudan. Throughout February and early March there was a military build up in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, however a deal was brokered on 11 March, with the RSF withdrawing its forces from the capital. As part of this deal negotiations were conducted between the SAF, RSF and civilian leaders, but these were delayed and halted by political disagreements. Chief among the disputes was the integration of the RSF into the military: The RSF insisted on a 10-year timetable for its integration into the regular army, while the army demanded integration within two years. Other contested issues included the status given to RSF officers in the future hierarchy, and whether RSF forces should be under the command of the army chief rather than Sudan's commander-in-chief, who is al-Burhan.\n\nOn 11 April 2023, RSF forces were deployed near the city of Merowe as well as in Khartoum. Government forces ordered them to leave, and they refused. This led to clashes when RSF forces took control of the Soba military base south of Khartoum. On 13 April, RSF forces began their mobilization, raising fears of a potential rebellion against the junta. The SAF declared the mobilization illegal.\nCourse of the war\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the War in Sudan (2023\u2013present).\nSee also: List of engagements during the war in Sudan (2023)\nApril\u2013May\nBattle of Khartoum\nMain article: Battle of Khartoum (2023-present)\n\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport.

It must be stated that in Israel, such a system was used during the state's early years and that the judges that established the Supreme Court were appointed by the government with the Knesset's approval.\n    Only four OECD member states, besides Israel, appoint their constitutional court judges without giving the elected officials the ability to appoint the judges: Turkey, Greece, the UK and Luxembourg. However, the UK and Luxembourg are distinct from Israel and most other states in that their judges cannot void parliament's laws, and that the supremacy of the public's values are attained by legislative supremacy. From this, of the 36 OECD countries, Israel's sole companions in giving a veto to non-elected officials over judicial appointed to the highest tribunal authorized to strike down parliament's laws, are Greece and Turkey.\n    Of the 50 states that compose the United States, in 22 states, the supreme court judges are elected directly by voting ballot; in another 15 states, the appointments are ratified in a direct vote; four states elect their judges through the public officials and eight states appoint by committees in which the majority of the members are appointed by elected officials.\n\nArguments against the reform\nA sign at a demonstration in Haifa, saying \"Right-wingers against the legal revolution\", 8 April 2023\n\nThe Kohelet Policy Forum study used to underpin most of the above arguments has been strongly criticized as being selective in its reliance on foreign legal systems. For example:\n\n    While 31 of the 36 countries in the study have public representatives selecting the judges, in 24 of them, judges are selected in consultation with the judicial system and upon its recommendation.\n    Further, while in most of these countries such a recommendation carries no legal force, in practice it is binding, as the public representatives listen to the judges' recommendations and act upon them. As noted in a study, \"the political culture in these countries is such that public representatives select the judges with the consent and blessing of the judicial system \u2014 a political culture completely different than that in Israel.\"\n    The same study notes: \"The other developed countries, in which there is no appreciable involvement of the justice system in judicial selection, are almost all countries with constitutions. Some have a federal structure of several states, each with its own additional supreme court protecting the residents of that federal state. Most have bicameral legislatures not necessarily controlled by the party controlling the executive branch, and so the government's power is decentralized. Usually judicial selection requires the consent of the government as well as both houses of parliament, and almost always the choice in the legislative chambers requires a large majority (usually two thirds of the votes, and even an absolute majority). In other words, the coalition, which does not rule alone and cannot appoint judges on its own, needs the consent of the opposition as well. None of this exists in Israel, and that completely changes the picture.\"\n    The proposed changes would also grant the government complete control in appointing judges to all courts other than the Supreme Court. The justification for changing the manner of appointing judges to courts other than the Supreme Court is unclear.\n\nIn addition, the Knesset's Research Unit, in a survey, also presented a very different picture, quoting an OECD report arguing that on the purposes promoted by most democracies is to prevent any single power control over judicial appointment of constitutional court justices.\n\nThe Israeli Law Professors Forum for Democracy, comprising over 100 legal experts and academics in Israel, has published a number of position papers analyzing these reforms, concluding that their implementation would undermine the judiciary's \"independence, subordinate the judiciary to the elected government, and render the separation of powers in Israel an empty shell\".\n\nAccording to Elise Brezis, director of the Azrieli Center for Economic Policy at Bar-Ilan University, the Kohelet Policy Forum did not attempt to assess the impact their plan will have on the Israeli economy. She compared the plan to a \"pretty architectural sketch with no engineering assessment.\"\nGovernment legal advisors\n\nThe coalition has published a draft bill to reclassify ministry legal advisers from independent authorities to politically selected counsel whose opinions are explicitly non-binding upon the government and its ministers. The draft bill determines that \"legal advice given to the government\" or to \"the prime minister and all government ministers, will not obligate it or be able to alter its legal position\", and that the cabinet and its ministers are \"authorized to reject legal advice and operate against it.\"", "The 2023 Israeli judicial reform is a set of five changes to the judicial system and the balance of powers in Israel that was proposed in January 2023. The intent of the measures is to curb the judiciary's influence over lawmaking and public policy by limiting the Supreme Court's power to exercise judicial review, granting the government control over judicial appointments and limiting the authority of its legal advisors. The effort was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Yariv Levin and the Chair of the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, Simcha Rothman.\n\nThe Supreme Court has, for several decades, assumed the right to declare Knesset legislation unconstitutional. The reform would permit the Knesset to override such a ruling by reintroducing the legislation and approving it with a majority of Knesset members. The reform would additionally diminish the ability of courts to conduct judicial review of the Basic Laws and change the makeup of the Judicial Selection Committee, so that control over the appointment of judges is effectively given to the government.\n\nLevin and the ruling government coalition have stated that the above is the first step in their judicial reform, and that additional steps are planned, including changing the appointment process of legal advisors to government ministries, such that they are appointed and dismissed by the ministers; making their legal advice a recommendation rather than binding on the ministers; and making them subordinate directly to the ministers rather than to the Justice Ministry's professional oversight. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that the reform is necessary because the judiciary has too much control over public policy, and a better balance is needed between democratically elected legislators and the judiciary. However, Netanyahu has been barred from actively taking part in the process of the judicial reform by the Attorney General, due to a conflict of interest stemming from his ongoing corruption trial.\n\nThe coalition is also advancing a number of other bills concerning Israel's judicial system and the balance of powers, including reforms to widen the authority of the Rabbinical Court, allowing them to act as arbitrators in civil matters using religious law, if both parties consent; bills limiting the ability to call for a no-confidence vote and other methods for dissolving a sitting Knesset; bills prohibiting criminal proceedings against sitting Prime Ministers; and bills permitting key public service positions to be positions of trust appointed by politicians rather than professional appointments.\n\nThe proposed reform has sparked significant backlash, as well as some support, both inside and outside of Israel. Opposition leaders and activists accused the government of undermining established norms of checks and balances and attempting to seize absolute power, with some arguing the reform amounts to an attempt at regime change. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, has called for the reforms to be halted to allow for a wider consultative process, and the president of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General have attested to the reform's illegalities. Protests against the reform escalated in Israel shortly after its introduction, as did significant concern among some in the international community.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, after public protests and general strikes, Netanyahu announced a pause in the reform process to allow for dialogue with opposition parties. However, negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise collapsed in June, and the government resumed its plans to unilaterally pass parts of the legislation. On 24 July 2023, the Knesset passed a bill that curbs the power of the Supreme Court to declare government decisions unreasonable; on 1 January 2024, the Supreme Court struck the bill down.\nBackground\nSee also: Thirty-seventh government of Israel \u00a7 Controversies\nDemonstrators against the judicial reform in Haifa, 11 January 2023.

The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management deployed the Icelandic Coast Guard Vessel \u00de\u00f3r to the area \"for safety purposes\". It also closed all roads to Grindav\u00edk except for emergency and evacuation purposes. On 13 November, authorities allowed residents to return briefly to the town to retrieve their belongings. Boat owners were also allowed to remove their vessels from the harbour. The Icelandic government is seeking to accommodate displaced residents in holiday homes and little-used properties while the emergency continues. The subsidence, faulting and earthquakes have caused widespread damage to properties and infrastructure in the town. The seismic activity has received significant coverage by the international media. The evacuation of Grindav\u00edk has been described as the first community-level evacuation in Iceland since the eruption of Heimaey in 1973.\n\nPrior to the evacuation, reports emerged of individuals relocating due to the incessant tremors disrupting sleep and fears of potential consequences. During the evacuation, the Icelandic Red Cross provided accommodation for about 1,700 displaced residents at three emergency centers in Keflav\u00edk, K\u00f3pavogur, and Selfoss. Of these individuals, approximately 140 actually spent the night in these centers. The majority of the other displaced residents independently found alternative accommodations elsewhere. Furthermore, every individual in the Grindav\u00edk area received an SMS message from 112, Iceland's emergency service, with the headline \"EVACUATION\".\n\nThe Icelandic government plans to assist around 700 residents, who are part of about 200 families, from the original 3,700 population of Grindav\u00edk. The plan includes purchasing up to 210 new apartments through two non-profit housing associations, primarily in the Reykjanes area and the Capital Region. This is to be supplemented by temporary financial support for increased housing costs, with the entire support system estimated to cost about 220\u2013240 million ISK per month, subject to a three-month reassessment. This initiative represents a comprehensive effort to provide both immediate and sustainable housing solutions for Grindav\u00edk's displaced residents. On 1 December, the government, in partnership with the Government Property Agency, began seeking additional temporary rental properties from private and corporate owners to assist displaced Grindav\u00edk residents as part of a larger pre-established housing support program that includes wage and rental subsidies. A week later, a platform for Grindav\u00edk residents was launched online, targeting temporary housing in the Reykjanes peninsula, the Capital Region, and neighboring municipalities. It enables direct leasing between residents and property owners, supported by government rental subsidies.\n\nIn a collaborative response to the disaster and ongoing uncertainty in Grindav\u00edk, Iceland's major banks\u2014Arion Banki, \u00cdslandsbanki, and Landsbankinn, in partnership with the Financial Services Industry Association in Iceland\u2014agreed to waive interest and indexation on housing loans for Grindav\u00edk residents for three months. This relief applies to loans up to 50 million ISK. The measure aims to provide equitable support, including options like deferred loan repayments. Each bank will further outline the specifics of these relief measures, ensuring they are tailored to the evolving needs of their customers in Grindav\u00edk.\n\nThe State Commissioner of Police, in consultation with the Police Commissioner in the Reykjanes peninsula, downgraded the earthquake risk level in Grindav\u00edk from emergency to critical level, effective from 23 November. This decision, based on a new assessment by the Icelandic Meteorological Office, indicated a reduced likelihood of a sudden eruption in Grindav\u00edk. Residents and businesses in Grindav\u00edk were then permitted to enter the area between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. to retrieve valuables, attend to their properties, and conduct business activities. However, the town remained closed to the general public and unauthorized traffic. Safety measures, including limited vehicle access with restriction on certain types of transportation, constraints on essential services and a prepared evacuation plan, were established. The area, under continuous surveillance, is still considered dangerous. Residents were advised to keep records of valuables taken and to contact their insurance companies, and to be cautious as houses might be unsafe. However, a resident of Grindav\u00edk was later caught staying at his home with his wife for several nights and was threatened with arrest.\n\nThe earthquakes in Grindav\u00edk significantly affected infrastructure and homes.

In cases where rebuilding at the original location was not permitted, property owners were then allowed to use their insurance proceeds to buy homes elsewhere.\nBlue Lagoon\n\nThe management of the Blue Lagoon spa announced the site's closure to visitors from 9 to 16 November as a precaution following the earthquakes. Rocks dislodged by the earthquakes were reported to have fallen onto roads in the area, and 30 guests left the resort following a 4.8 tremor in the early hours of 9 November. In addition to these safety concerns, the closure was also implemented to reduce increased stress on staff. The management has assured that all staff will receive their full salaries during the closure period. Furthermore, guests who were evacuated as a result of the tremor will be provided with a full refund.\n\nHelga \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir, CEO of the Blue Lagoon, confirmed that the seismic activity at Svartsengi caused no visible damage or structural impairment to their facilities. The buildings, designed for earthquake resilience, remained intact and structurally sound. The Blue Lagoon temporarily ceased operations as a precautionary measure due to the earthquakes.\n\nThe administrators of the Blue Lagoon subsequently extended the closure announcement five times due to continuing geological activity, with the anticipated reopening date set for 17 December. Staff members of the Blue Lagoon were seen bathing in the spa's geothermal waters on 8 December. Prior to reopening, the staff were trained in evacuation procedures to ensure preparedness for any emergencies, while the administration prepared an evacuation process, expected to take around two hours in case of emergency. Additionally, guests were to be informed about the current situation.\n\nThe Blue Lagoon remained open for just two days before it closed again after the 18 December eruption only 2 to 3 kilometres (1.2 to 1.9 mi) away. All guests and staff were evacuated from the site roughly one to two hours before the eruption. The Blue Lagoon reopened on 6 January, with all facilities back in operation by 10 January. However, it was shut down once again on 14 January but reopened on 20 January. It was safely evacuated at the start of the 8 February eruption but was cut off by a fast-moving lava flow engulfing its main access road from the north.\nSvartsengi Power Station\n\nSince the state of emergency was declared, the Svartsengi Power Station has been unoccupied and is being remotely controlled from the Reykjanes Power Station. The management of the power station expected to maintain this remote operation mode until the end of 2023. The Reykjanes Power Station is equipped to generate electricity in case the Svartsengi line is cut off. The capability to deliver hot water, a critical function of the Svartsengi Power Station, cannot be replicated by the Reykjanes facility.\n\nThe power station experienced minimal impact from the earthquakes, with the only damage being \"the interior furnishings and exterior walls, as well as considerable cracking in pathways and remote areas of the site.\" Despite these issues, the power station continued to maintain its usual production levels of hot and cold water, as well as electricity. However, the eruption of 8 February cut off the northern access road to the power station and destroyed the Njar\u00f0v\u00edkur\u00e6\u00f0 hot water pipe supplying hot water from Svartsengi to Reykjanesb\u00e6r, Su\u00f0urnesjab\u00e6r, and other communities on the peninsula. Hot water shortages were reported at Keflavik International Airport. Residents of the peninsula were warned to use hot water and electricity sparingly."]}, {"query": "Which separatist group, mentioned in the interview, has been losing ranks since 2013 and is currently believed to have several hundred fighters based out of Afghanistan Balochistan borderland?", "response": "\nThe separatist group that has been losing ranks since 2013 and is currently believed to have several hundred fighters based out of Afghanistan Balochistan borderland is the Baloch Republican Army (BRA).", "contexts": ["The Insurgency in Balochistan is an insurgency or revolt by Baloch separatist insurgents and various Islamist militant groups against the governments of Pakistan and Iran in the Balochistan region, which covers the Pakistani province of Balochistan, Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchestan, and Balochistan of southern Afghanistan. Rich in natural resources, this is the largest, least populated and least developed province in Pakistan and Iran, and armed groups demand greater control of the province's natural resources and political autonomy. Baloch separatists have attacked civilians from other ethnicities throughout the province. In the 2010s, attacks against the Shia community by sectarian groups\u2014though not always directly related to the political struggle\u2014have risen, contributing to tensions in Balochistan. In Pakistan, the ethnic separatist insurgency is low-scale but ongoing mainly in southern Balochistan, as well as sectarian and religiously motivated militancy concentrated mainly in northern and central Balochistan.\n\nIn Pakistan's Balochistan province, insurgencies by Baloch nationalists have been fought in 1948, 1958\u201359, 1962\u201363 and 1973\u20131977, with an ongoing low-level insurgency beginning in 2003. This insurgency has begun to weaken. In an article titled \"The End of Pakistan's Baloch Insurgency?\", Baloch analyst Malik Siraj Akbar reported that Baloch militants had begun killing their own commanders. Furthermore, separatists in recent times have also accused their own groups of being involved in wide spread crime, robbery and rapes against Baloch women, with some claiming that what started as an idealistic political fight for their people's rights has turned into gangs extorting, kidnapping and even raping locals. However, Akbar called anger towards provincial Chief Minister Abdul Malik Baloch \"growing and often uncontrollable\". Baloch militants have taken some reconciliation offers from the government and offered to hand in their weapons. In April 2016, four militant commanders and 144 militants had surrendered under reconciliation. 600 rebels were killed and 1,025 surrendered after accepting reconciliation as of August 2016. In April 2017, another 500 Baloch rebels surrendered to the state, including members of BRA, UBA, and LeB.\n\nBaloch separatists argue they are economically marginalised and poor compared to the rest of Pakistan. The Balochistan Liberation Army, designated as a terrorist organisation by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States, is the most widely known Baloch separatist group. Since 2000 it has conducted numerous deadly attacks on Pakistani military troops, police, journalists, civilians and education institutions. Other separatist groups include Lashkar-e-Balochistan and the Balochistan Liberation United Front (BLUF).\n\nHuman rights activists have accused nationalist militants, Government of Pakistan and Iran of human rights abuses in its suppression of the insurgency.\n\nThe News International reported in 2012 that a Gallup survey conducted for DFID revealed that the most of the Balochistan province does not support independence from Pakistan, with only 37% of ethnic Baloch and 12% of Pashtuns in Balochistan favoring independence. However, 67% of Balochistan's population favored greater provincial autonomy, including 79% of ethnic Baloch and 53% of Pashtuns in the province.\nArea of dispute\n\nHistorical Balochistan covers the southern part of the Iranian Sistan and Baluchestan Province in the west, the Pakistani province of Balochistan in the east, and, in the northwest, part of Afghanistan's Helmand Province. The Gulf of Oman forms its southern border. Mountains and desert make up much of the region's terrain. A majority of Baloch inhabit the region of Balochistan that predominantly falls within Pakistan's borders.\n\nGeographically, Balochistan is the largest province of Pakistan (comprising 44% of the country's total area), but it is the least developed and least inhabited, comprising only 5% of the total population. Sunni Islam is the predominant religion throughout the Balochistan region.\n\nStuart Notholt, in his Atlas of Ethnic Conflict, describes the unrest in Balochistan as a \"nationalist/self-determination conflict\".\nHistory\nBackground\n\nThe origins of the secessionist movement are believed to have started around the uncertainty regarding the Khanate of Kalat, established in 1666 by Mir Ahmad. The Khanate of Kalat occupied central portions of territory in present day Balochistan, and was one of the four princely states of the modern day province under British rule, namely Makran, Las Bela, Kharan and Kalat.", "The council's claimed domain includes Sistan and Baluchestan Province, as well as Pakistani Balochistan, but does not include Afghan Baloch regions. The council claimed the allegiance of \"all separatist leaders including Nawabzada Bramdagh Bugti.\" Suleiman Dawood stated that the UK had a \"moral responsibility to raise the issue of Balochistan's illegal occupation at international level.\"\n\nThe Economist wrote:\n\n    \"[The Baloch separatists] are supported\u2014with money, influence or sympathy\u2014by some members of the powerful Bugti tribe and by parts of the Baloch middle class. This makes today's insurgency stronger than previous ones, but the separatists will nevertheless struggle to prevail over Pakistan's huge army.\"\n    \u2014\u200aThe Economist, April 2012\n\nIn the aftermath of Akbar Bugti's killing, support for the insurgency surged with a large amount of support coming from Balochistan's burgeoning middle class. US-based exiled Baloch journalist and newspaper editor Malik Siraj Akbar writes that the ongoing Baloch resistance has created \"serious challenges\" for the Pakistan government, \"unlike the past resistance movements\", because it has lasted longer than previous insurgencies, has greater breadth\u2014including the entire province \"from rural mountainous regions to the city centers\", involves Baloch women and children at \"regular protest rallies\", and has drawn more international attention\u2014including a 2012 hearing by the US Congress. Islamabad has accused its neighbour India of supporting the insurgency in Balochistan. However infighting between insurgent groups as of late 2014 has weakened the movement. On 23 November Chinese Consulate was attacked by BLA fighters.\n\nAs of 2018, the Pakistani state was using Islamist militants to defeat Balochi separatists. Academics and journalists in the United States have been approached by Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence spies, who threatened them not to speak about the insurgency in Balochistan, as well as human rights abuses by the Pakistani Army or else their family would be harmed.\n\nOn 16 February 2019, armed men killed two Frontier Corps in Loralai.

In 1978, however, he was removed from office by a communist coup in Afghanistan, after which Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power and established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Nur Muhammad Taraki reopened the Baloch training camps in Afghanistan and once again started offering arms and aid to Baloch rebels.\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks cables published in 2010, the then-president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, had been providing shelter to Brahumdagh Bugti for several years. Brahumdagh Bugti, along with some 20 separatists, had fled to Afghanistan in 2006, and his presence in Afghanistan had created tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In 2007 Pakistan's president, Pervaiz Musharraf, stated that Bugti was freely traveling between Kabul and Kandahar, raising money and planning attacks against Pakistani security forces. Musharraf repeatedly asked Hamid Karzai to hand over Bugti, which Karzai refused to do. In public, Afghan officials denied providing shelter to Bugti, but later, following a 2009 meeting between UN officials and Karzai, admitted that Bugti was indeed living in Kabul. While speaking to The Guardian, Bugti admitted that he was leading the fight against Pakistan's army. In 2010 he travelled to Switzerland and took up residence there. In 2017, his request for political asylum was rejected by Swiss authorities on the grounds that he had been linked to \"incidents of terrorism, violence and militant activities\".\n\nThe Chief of Frontier Corps troops in Balochistan, Major General Obaidullah Khan Khattak, said in June 2012 that \"over 30 militant camps\" had been established in Afghanistan. The camps receive support from Afghanistan and are used \"to launch terrorist and anti-state activities in Balochistan\". Malik Siraj Akbar, a Washington-based analyst, states that Afghanistan has always been a relatively safe hideout for the Baloch nationalist militants.\n\nOn 25 December 2018, Aslam Baloch, alias Achu, and six other Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) commanders were killed in a suicide attack in Kandahar, Afghanistan. A BLA spokesman confirmed their deaths. Afghan officials stated that General Abdul Raziq Achakzai had housed Aslam Baloch and other separatist in Kandahar for years. Moreover, the Afghan news channel TOLOnews reported that Aslam Baloch had been residing in Afghanistan since 2005. According to Kandahar police chief Tadin Khan Achakzai, Aslam Baloch and Abdul Raziq Achakzai were 'close friends' and that 'Afghans will continue supporting separatist groups in their fight against the government of Pakistan'.[citation needed]\n\nOn 23 May 2019, a similar attack took place in Aino Mina, Kandahar.

Afghan provincial council member Yousaf Younasi . said it was the second attack on Baloch Liberation Army members in recent years in Kandahar's posh Aino Mina residential area, and that Aslam Baloch, alias Achu, had been killed in the same area. Baloch separatist leader Sher Muhammad Bugti confirmed that the attack had taken place, but said that target of the attack was a senior separatist leader, Shah Wali Bugti. He said that 'Baloch separatist are not safe in Kandahar and they have come under attack in three places over the past few months'.

In a book he authored, Paliwal says these officers claim that \"we gave Baloch everything, from money to guns, during the 1970s, everything\". He further states that, like Pakistan and India, Iraq and Iran were bitter rivals. As a result, Pakistan and Iran had developed closer relations with each other, while India and Iraq did likewise. Arming Baloch insurgents in Iran and Pakistan was in the interest of both Iraq and India.", "During a camp at Broken Chair, Geneva, Baloch Republican Party (BRP) leader Sher Baz Bugti alleged that Baloch youth, women and children were kept in \"torture cells\". BRP chief Brahumdagh Bugti called upon human rights organisation, including the United Nations, to take steps to stop the alleged \"Baloch genocide\".\nSunni extremism and religious persecution of Zikris\n\nThe activities of terrorist organisations such as Lashkar-i-Jhangvi and Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, have produced a surge in religious extremism in Balochistan. Hindus, Shias (including Hazaras) and Zikris have been targeted, resulting in the migration of over 300,000 of them from Baluchistan.\n\nBaloch Liberation Front (BLF) and Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) have also targeted Zikris in the province.\nSupreme Court investigation\n\nThere are more than 5,000 cases of 'forced disappearances' in Balochistan. Many are innocent and stuck in Pakistan's slow court system whilst others are in prison awaiting charges on a range of things such as gun smuggling and robbery. The chief justice of an apex court of Pakistan asked about the situation and said it was going out of control in Balochistan. The Supreme Court is currently investigating the \"missing persons\" and issued an arrest warrant for the former Military Dictator Pervez Musharaff. Furthermore, the Chief Justice of the court said the military must act under the government's direction and follow well-defined parameters set by the Constitution.\nMissing people found\n\nIn June 2011, the prime minister was informed that 41 missing people had returned to their homes, false cases against 38 had been withdrawn and several others had been traced. The PM urged police to trace the missing people and help them to return to their homes. In 2011, government established a commission which registered 5,369 missing person's complaints. The commission claims to have traced more than 3,600 people. In October 2018, Balochistan National Party (Mengal) (BNP-M) claimed that around 300 missing Baloch persons had returned their homes. Similarly in January 2019, Voice of Baloch Missing People (VBMP) decided to end their suspend their protest after around dozens of returned to their homes. VBMP gave a list of 110 missing people which the VBMP expects the government recover them within two months.\n\nOn 29 June 2019, around 200 missing Baloch people were recovered according to Balochistan Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove.

This is challenged by Baloch nationalist groups, who argue the benefits of these policies have not accrued to native Baloch residents of the province.[citation needed] Baloch nationalist groups continue to highlight the extraction of natural resources, especially natural gas, from the province, without discernible economic benefit to the Baloch people.[citation needed] Nonetheless, the government of Pakistan continues to insist that industrial zones are planned along the new Gawadar-Karachi highway.

Several of Sudan's neighbors, including Chad, Egypt and South Sudan closed their border with Sudan, while Eritrea said it would not establish refugee camps for those crossing its border from Sudan.\n\nInternational organizations also echoed demands for an end to the fighting and the restoration of civilian government.", "Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the Darfur Peace Agreement, with some factions joining the government in Khartoum. By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour. The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur had refused to sign and kept fighting.\n\nThe SPLM-N was founded by units of the predominantly South Sudanese Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army stationed in areas that remained in Sudan following the South Sudanese vote for independence in 2011. These forces then led a rebellion in the southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile a few months later. In 2017, the SPLM-N split between a faction led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and one led by Malik Agar, with al-Hilu demanding secularism as a condition for peace while Agar did not agree with this. During the Sudanese Revolution, al-Hilu's faction declared an indefinite unilateral ceasefire. In 2020, a peace agreement was signed between the Sudanese government and Agar's faction, with Agar later joining the Transitional Sovereignty Council in Khartoum. Al-Hilu held out until he agreed to sign a separate peace agreement with the Sudanese government a few months after. Further steps to consolidate the agreement stalled following the 2021 coup, and the al-Hilu faction instead signed an agreement with the SLM-al-Nur and the Sudanese Communist Party, agreeing to co-operate in order to draft a 'revolutionary charter' and remove the military from power.\nPrelude\n\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak Sudanese economy steeply declined, fuelling wide protests demanding that the junta relinquish power back to civilian authorities. Tensions soon arose between the two junta leaders over al-Burhan's restoration to office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government. Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics. This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab. As a sign of the growing rift between him and al-Burhan, Hemedti expressed regret over the October 2021 coup.\n\nTensions between the RSF and the SAF began to escalate in February 2023, as the RSF began to recruit members from across Sudan. Throughout February and early March there was a military build up in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, however a deal was brokered on 11 March, with the RSF withdrawing its forces from the capital. As part of this deal negotiations were conducted between the SAF, RSF and civilian leaders, but these were delayed and halted by political disagreements. Chief among the disputes was the integration of the RSF into the military: The RSF insisted on a 10-year timetable for its integration into the regular army, while the army demanded integration within two years. Other contested issues included the status given to RSF officers in the future hierarchy, and whether RSF forces should be under the command of the army chief rather than Sudan's commander-in-chief, who is al-Burhan.\n\nOn 11 April 2023, RSF forces were deployed near the city of Merowe as well as in Khartoum. Government forces ordered them to leave, and they refused. This led to clashes when RSF forces took control of the Soba military base south of Khartoum. On 13 April, RSF forces began their mobilization, raising fears of a potential rebellion against the junta. The SAF declared the mobilization illegal.\nCourse of the war\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the War in Sudan (2023\u2013present).\nSee also: List of engagements during the war in Sudan (2023)\nApril\u2013May\nBattle of Khartoum\nMain article: Battle of Khartoum (2023-present)\n\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport.

From 7 to 31 October, B'Tselem said that Israeli forces had killed more than 100 Palestinians while Israeli settlers had killed at least seven, leading to fears that the situation would escalate out of control. About 1,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settlers since 7 October and almost half of clashes have included \"Israeli forces accompanying or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out the attacks\" according to a U.N. report.

Legal and genocide experts have condemned the attack, during which 1,139 people were killed, including 695 Israeli civilians. They argue that these actions by Hamas constitute a significant violation of international law and were carried out with the intent to destroy the Israeli national group. Some commentators highlight Hamas's founding charter, which calls for the destruction of Israel; this has led to suggestions that its intent is genocidal and that the attacks on 7 October were an attempt to fulfill this agenda.\n\nIn a 12 October preliminary legal assessment condemning Hamas's attacks in Israel, international humanitarian law scholar and Dean of Cornell Law School Jens David Ohlin said the evidence suggested Hamas's \"killings and kidnappings\" potentially violated Articles 6\u20138 of the Rome Statute as well as the Genocide Convention and were \"crimes against humanity\"; over a hundred international scholars expressed support for this position.\nSexual and gender-based violence\nMain article: Sexual and gender-based violence in the 7 October attack on Israel\n\nDuring the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities, Israeli women and girls were reportedly raped, assaulted, and mutilated by Hamas militants, an allegation that Hamas denies. In the months following the attacks, The Wall Street Journal reported on 21 December, there was \"mounting evidence of sexual violence, based on survivor accounts, first responders and witnesses.\" A two-month New York Times investigation, released in late December 2023, found at least seven locations where sexual assaults and mutilations of Israeli women and girls were carried out. It concluded that these were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence during the 7 October massacres. The probe was based on video footage, photographs, GPS data from mobile phones and interviews with more than 150 people. The newspaper's probe concluded that Hamas \"weaponized sexual violence\" during the attacks. Israeli police said dozens of women and some men were raped. The New York Times reported that \"videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers.\"\n\nThese acts were denounced as gender-based violence, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, aligning with the International Criminal Court's recognition of sexual violence as such."]}, {"query": "Which countries publicly acknowledged the role of Iran in arming Hamas militants prior to the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, and how did Iranian officials respond to these allegations?", "response": "\nBased on the provided text, the following countries publicly acknowledged the role of Iran in arming Hamas militants prior to the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel:\n\n* United States\n* Israel\n\nAccording to the text, US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that there was no evidence that Iran was connected with the attack by Hamas.

At around 6:30 a.m. IDT (UTC+3) on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes. Israeli sources reported that at least 3,000 projectiles had been launched from Gaza. At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks. Explosions were reported in areas surrounding the strip and in cities in the Sharon Plain including Gedera, Herzliyya, Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon. Air raid sirens were activated in Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Rehovot, Rishon Lezion, and Palmachim Airbase. Hamas issued a call to arms, with commander Mohammad Deif calling on \"Muslims everywhere to launch an attack\" and to \"kill them [the enemy] wherever you may find them\".\n\nHamas employed tactics such as using aerial drones to disable Israeli observation posts, paragliders for infiltration into Israel, and motorcycles, which was unusual for Hamas. Palestinian militants opened fire on Israeli boats, while clashes broke out between Palestinians and the Israel Defense Forces along the Gaza perimeter fence. In the evening, Hamas launched another barrage of 150 rockets towards Israel, with explosions reported in Yavne, Givatayim, Bat Yam, Beit Dagan, Tel Aviv, and Rishon Lezion.\n\nSimultaneously, around 3,000 Hamas militants infiltrated Israel from Gaza using trucks, pickup trucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and paragliders. They took over checkpoints at Kerem Shalom and Erez, and created openings in the border fence in five other places. Images and videos showed armed and masked militants, riding pickup trucks and opening fire in Sderot. Other videos display Israelis taken prisoner, a burning Israeli tank, and militants driving Israeli military vehicles.\n\nHamas has also stated that its attack was in response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, rising Israeli settler violence and recent escalations at Al-Aqsa. Intelligence and security officials from multiple Western countries say that Hamas initiated the war to create a \"permanent\" state of war and to revive interest in the Palestinian cause.\nMilitary base attacks\nFurther information: Battle of Re'im and Battle of Zikim\n\nHamas militants carried out an amphibious landing in Zikim.", "In a speech on 3 November, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Americans had threatened to bomb Iran, and emphasized that Hezbollah had entered the war the day after Hamas's attack and that it would not stop its ongoing skirmishes with Israel.

Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad told the BBC that Hamas had direct backing for the attack from Iran; European, Iranian and Syrian officers corroborated Iran's involvement, while senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mirdawi said the group planned the attacks on its own. The Israeli army and the United States say that there is no evidence that Iran is connected with the attack by Hamas. American intelligence appeared to show that Hamas's attack on Israel caught Iranian authorities by surprise.\n\nAccording to a report by Al-Monitor, since the start of the war between Israel and the Gaza militias, Iran has tried to show a face of disinterest in the spillover of the conflict, and on the other hand, it has pursued an active diplomatic campaign to isolate Israel. Supporting the cause of Palestine has been one of the ideological principles of Iran's Shia Islamic theocracy after the 1979 revolution, with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the first supreme leader of Iran, announcing the last Friday of every Ramadan as \"Quds Day\" and inviting all the Muslims of the world to express solidarity with the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Muslim people.\n\nThe Iranian government opened an account for people to deliver charitable aid. It also opened a website and reported that more than six million volunteered to fight. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened that Islamic resistance was going to become unstoppable should the war continue. His spokesperson later said that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal would have delayed it but Israel would have collapsed within five years. Khamenei pointed to foreign visits to Israel and said that the fall of Israel was imminent.\n\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that the IDF would be depleted through the ground invasion of Gaza.\n\nAddressing the United Nations, Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned Americans they would be unsafe if the conflict did not remain under control. US military forces conducted strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria used by the IRGC. President Joe Biden warned Khamenei not to attack the US military.\n\nOn 1 November, the Iranian government criminalized expressions of support for Israel and making contact with its people. That same day, Khamenei called on Muslim states to impose a food and fuel blockade on Israel.\n\nOn 15 November, Reuters and the Telegraph reported that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, conveyed to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh during their November meeting in Tehran that Iran would not directly intervene in the conflict with Israel, citing lack of prior warning about the 7 October attack. Despite this, Iran pledged to continue providing political and moral support to Hamas, urging restraint against calls for direct involvement by Iran and its ally Hezbollah. The IRGC's Quds Force promised it would continue supporting Hamas, while the IRGC's commander General Hossein Salami said that the war would bring about a political and economic decline of the US.\n\nThe Municipality of Tehran announced that it would help rebuild Gaza after the conflict.\n\nFollowing the US veto of a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian called the threat of war by any party as uncontrollable.\n\nThe IRGC said that the 7 October attack was done by Hamas in revenge for the killing of its head, Qassem Soleimani in 2020, which Hamas denied.\nUnited States\nFurther information: United States support for Israel in the Israel\u2013Hamas war and 2023 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria\n\nPolling has indicated a divide between official government policy on the Israel\u2013Hamas war and the viewpoints of the general public.

This would preclude the courts from hearing petitions or appeals against governmental and administrative decisions on the basis that such decisions are 'unreasonable'.", "contexts": ["The 2023 Israeli judicial reform is a set of five changes to the judicial system and the balance of powers in Israel that was proposed in January 2023. The intent of the measures is to curb the judiciary's influence over lawmaking and public policy by limiting the Supreme Court's power to exercise judicial review, granting the government control over judicial appointments and limiting the authority of its legal advisors. The effort was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Yariv Levin and the Chair of the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, Simcha Rothman.\n\nThe Supreme Court has, for several decades, assumed the right to declare Knesset legislation unconstitutional. The reform would permit the Knesset to override such a ruling by reintroducing the legislation and approving it with a majority of Knesset members. The reform would additionally diminish the ability of courts to conduct judicial review of the Basic Laws and change the makeup of the Judicial Selection Committee, so that control over the appointment of judges is effectively given to the government.\n\nLevin and the ruling government coalition have stated that the above is the first step in their judicial reform, and that additional steps are planned, including changing the appointment process of legal advisors to government ministries, such that they are appointed and dismissed by the ministers; making their legal advice a recommendation rather than binding on the ministers; and making them subordinate directly to the ministers rather than to the Justice Ministry's professional oversight. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that the reform is necessary because the judiciary has too much control over public policy, and a better balance is needed between democratically elected legislators and the judiciary. However, Netanyahu has been barred from actively taking part in the process of the judicial reform by the Attorney General, due to a conflict of interest stemming from his ongoing corruption trial.\n\nThe coalition is also advancing a number of other bills concerning Israel's judicial system and the balance of powers, including reforms to widen the authority of the Rabbinical Court, allowing them to act as arbitrators in civil matters using religious law, if both parties consent; bills limiting the ability to call for a no-confidence vote and other methods for dissolving a sitting Knesset; bills prohibiting criminal proceedings against sitting Prime Ministers; and bills permitting key public service positions to be positions of trust appointed by politicians rather than professional appointments.\n\nThe proposed reform has sparked significant backlash, as well as some support, both inside and outside of Israel. Opposition leaders and activists accused the government of undermining established norms of checks and balances and attempting to seize absolute power, with some arguing the reform amounts to an attempt at regime change. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, has called for the reforms to be halted to allow for a wider consultative process, and the president of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General have attested to the reform's illegalities. Protests against the reform escalated in Israel shortly after its introduction, as did significant concern among some in the international community.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, after public protests and general strikes, Netanyahu announced a pause in the reform process to allow for dialogue with opposition parties. However, negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise collapsed in June, and the government resumed its plans to unilaterally pass parts of the legislation. On 24 July 2023, the Knesset passed a bill that curbs the power of the Supreme Court to declare government decisions unreasonable; on 1 January 2024, the Supreme Court struck the bill down.\nBackground\nSee also: Thirty-seventh government of Israel \u00a7 Controversies\nDemonstrators against the judicial reform in Haifa, 11 January 2023.

Justice Stein agreed in upholding the court's ability to strike down laws, writing that \"the Knesset never received the authority to pass any law it pleased\", but voted with the minority in favor of the proposed reform, finding that it \"violates no constitutional norm\". Sohlberg, meanwhile, wrote that \"frail legal constructs\" did not mean the court could overrule the Knesset.\nProposed changes\nJudicial selection\nCurrent system\n\nThe Judicial Selection Committee is composed of nine members. Three of them are Supreme Court judges, two are representatives of the Bar Association, two are Knesset members and two are ministers.

By the same token, the politicians cannot select judges without the agreement of the justices on the committee.

Moreover, the Afghan news channel TOLOnews reported that Aslam Baloch had been residing in Afghanistan since 2005. According to Kandahar police chief Tadin Khan Achakzai, Aslam Baloch and Abdul Raziq Achakzai were 'close friends' and that 'Afghans will continue supporting separatist groups in their fight against the government of Pakistan'.[citation needed]\n\nOn 23 May 2019, a similar attack took place in Aino Mina, Kandahar. Laghari Bugti and three other Baloch insurgents were killed, while a further twelve were injured. Afghan provincial council member Yousaf Younasi . said it was the second attack on Baloch Liberation Army members in recent years in Kandahar's posh Aino Mina residential area, and that Aslam Baloch, alias Achu, had been killed in the same area. Baloch separatist leader Sher Muhammad Bugti confirmed that the attack had taken place, but said that target of the attack was a senior separatist leader, Shah Wali Bugti. He said that 'Baloch separatist are not safe in Kandahar and they have come under attack in three places over the past few months'. Kandahar Police Chief Tadin Khan stated that the attack in Aino Mena took place outside the house of a former National Directorate of Security (NDS) official.\nIndia\n\nAvinash Paliwal claims that in the 1970s, Junior level Indian intelligence officers were actively involved in operations in Balochistan. In a book he authored, Paliwal says these officers claim that \"we gave Baloch everything, from money to guns, during the 1970s, everything\". He further states that, like Pakistan and India, Iraq and Iran were bitter rivals. As a result, Pakistan and Iran had developed closer relations with each other, while India and Iraq did likewise. Arming Baloch insurgents in Iran and Pakistan was in the interest of both Iraq and India.", "A majority of Baloch inhabit the region of Balochistan that predominantly falls within Pakistan's borders.\n\nGeographically, Balochistan is the largest province of Pakistan (comprising 44% of the country's total area), but it is the least developed and least inhabited, comprising only 5% of the total population. Sunni Islam is the predominant religion throughout the Balochistan region.\n\nStuart Notholt, in his Atlas of Ethnic Conflict, describes the unrest in Balochistan as a \"nationalist/self-determination conflict\".\nHistory\nBackground\n\nThe origins of the secessionist movement are believed to have started around the uncertainty regarding the Khanate of Kalat, established in 1666 by Mir Ahmad. The Khanate of Kalat occupied central portions of territory in present day Balochistan, and was one of the four princely states of the modern day province under British rule, namely Makran, Las Bela, Kharan and Kalat. Under Nasir I of Kalat in 1758, who accepted the Afghan paramountcy, the boundaries of Kalat stretched up to Dera Ghazi Khan in the east and Bandar Abbas in the west. However, in November 1839, the British invaded Kalat, and the Khan was killed in action during the invasion. Afterwards, the British influence in the region gradually grew. In 1869, the British Political Agent Robert Groves Sandeman ended up mediating a dispute between the Khan of Kalat and the Sardars of Balochistan, and established the British primacy in the region. The tribal areas of Marri, Bugti, Khetran and Chaghi were brought under the direct administration of a British Agent, eventually to become the Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan. Lasbela and Kharan were declared Special Areas with a different political system. The remaining areas of Sarawan, Jhalawan, Kacchi and Makran were retained as the Khanate of Kalat, supervised by a Political Agent of Kalat.\n\nIn the 20th century, the educated Baloch middle class harboured hopes of their independence from British colonial rule. They formed a nationalist movement Anjuman-e-Ittehad-e-Balochistan in 1931. One of their first campaigns was to fight for the accession of Azam Jan as the Khan of Kalat and a constitutional government to be established under him. They were successful in establishing Azam Jan as the Khan but the new Khan sided with the Sardars and turned his back on the Anjuman. His successor Mir Ahmad Yar Khan was more sympathetic to Anjuman but he was averse to upsetting his relations with the British. The Anujman, transformed into the Kalat State National Party (KSNP), continued to fight for independence from the British. It was declared illegal by the Khanate in 1939 and its active leaders and activists were exiled. This paved the way for the formation of new political parties, Balochistan Muslim League allied to the Muslim League in June 1939 and Anjuman-i-Watan allied to the Indian National Congress in the same year. Led by Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai, the Anjuman-i-Watan was opposed to the partition of India and wanted a united India after the country gained independence from Britain.\n\nDuring British rule Balochistan was under the rule of a Chief Commissioner and did not have the same status as other provinces of British India. The Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the period 1927-1947 strived to introduce reforms in Balochistan to bring it on par with other provinces of British India.\n\nDuring the time of the Indian independence movement, public opinion in Balochistan, at least in Quetta and other small towns in northern Balochistan, was overwhelmingly in favour of Pakistan. The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province's inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.\n\nThe Khan of Kalat lent great support to the Pakistan Movement but also desired to declare independence. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it clear that the princely states with the lapse of British paramountcy would have to join either India or Pakistan, keeping in mind their geographic and demographic compulsions.\n\nOn 19 July, Mountbatten called a Round Table Conference meeting between representatives of the State of Kalat and Government of Pakistan. Mountbatten discussed with them the status of the Kalat State."]}, {"query": "What measures were taken to construct protective barriers around the Svartsengi Power Station and the Blue Lagoon following the escalating earthquake activity in November 2023?", "response": "\n\n* A strategic plan for the construction of protective barriers had been established well in advance of the recent seismic disturbances in the area.\n* On 10 November, due to escalating earthquake activity, a fleet of lorries began delivering materials to the predetermined site near the Blue Lagoon and Svartsengi Power Station.\n* Workers began assembling filler materials into barriers at the planned sites.\n* Additional measures were also put in place, such as safeguarding power lines, although the construction of barriers for the Svartsengi Power Line was postponed until 2024 due to decreased volcanic activity.\n* Should the lava flow head towards the hot water line, protecting it without inflicting damage would be extremely challenging.\n* In response to these developments, the Icelandic government implemented a 0.008% additional property tax, levied on the fire insurance value of properties, to fund the construction of lava barriers on the Reykjanes peninsula and safeguard local infrastructure from potential volcanic eruptions.", "contexts": ["The capability to deliver hot water, a critical function of the Svartsengi Power Station, cannot be replicated by the Reykjanes facility.\n\nThe power station experienced minimal impact from the earthquakes, with the only damage being \"the interior furnishings and exterior walls, as well as considerable cracking in pathways and remote areas of the site.\" Despite these issues, the power station continued to maintain its usual production levels of hot and cold water, as well as electricity.

Hot water shortages were reported at Keflavik International Airport. Residents of the peninsula were warned to use hot water and electricity sparingly.\n\nIt is feared that should lava engulf the facility, approximately 30,000 residents on the peninsula, constituting about 8% of Iceland's population, would permanently lose essential heating and electricity. Construction of earth barriers began in November 2023, with the purpose of protecting the power station by redirecting future lava flows.\nBarrier construction\nA preliminary plan for the protective barriers intended to shield the Blue Lagoon and Svartsengi Power Station\n\nA strategic plan for the construction of protective barriers had been established well in advance of the recent seismic disturbances in the area. The commencement of this plan was placed on hold, as there was no pressing threat of a volcanic eruption, coupled with the significant environmental repercussions involved. However, on 10 November, due to escalating earthquake activity, a fleet of lorries began delivering materials to the predetermined site near the Blue Lagoon and Svartsengi Power Station. But this initial operation was soon put on hold owing to concerns about a potential eruption later that same day. The construction work was officially resumed on 13 November, following the Althing's approval of a bill proposed by Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. Subsequently, Justice Minister Gu\u00f0r\u00fan Hafsteinsd\u00f3ttir began enforcing the new regulations related to the project the next day. Following this, workers began assembling filler materials into barriers at the planned sites. The construction of the barriers was almost complete when the 18 December eruption occurred. Once it was safe for workers to resume, they were quickly sent back to the site to finish the remaining filling work on the barriers.\n\nAdditional measures were also put in place, such as safeguarding power lines, although the construction of barriers for the Svartsengi Power Line was postponed until 2024 due to decreased volcanic activity. However, should the lava flow head towards the hot water line, protecting it without inflicting damage would be extremely challenging.\n\nConstruction of protective barriers around Grindav\u00edk, for which plans were already in place prior to the eruptions, officially began on 2 January. The project, initiated from the eastern end, involves erecting a barrier extending over two kilometres (1.2 mi). Anticipated to last approximately three weeks, the initial phase of construction aims to reach an average height of around 4 metres (13 ft), although this may vary in different locations. The design of the barrier, guided by lava flow simulations, specifically targets the areas at highest risk.\n\nAlso under consideration is the construction of protective barriers for the town of Vogar, located in the northern part of the peninsula, after lava flow models indicated a chance of lava from the current eruption flowing north towards Route 41 (Reykjanesbraut) in the future. While Vogar and Route 41 are considered to have a low risk of being affected, Route 43 (Grindav\u00edkurvegur), being closer to the lava front, faces a medium risk in this scenario, prompting additional concern for its safety.\n\nIn response to these developments, the Icelandic government implemented a 0.008% additional property tax, levied on the fire insurance value of properties, to fund the construction of lava barriers on the Reykjanes peninsula and safeguard local infrastructure from potential volcanic eruptions. The temporary tax, which is intended to last for three years, came into effect on 1 January 2024, and is projected to raise nearly ISK 1 billion annually. The tax is scheduled to expire on 31 December 2026.\nReactions\n\nIn a televised address following the 14 January eruption, President Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson said that \"a daunting period of upheaval has begun on the Reykjanes peninsula,\" but urged the need to continue taking \"actions that are within our power,\" while \"hope for as good an outcome as possible\".", "and 9 p.m. to retrieve valuables, attend to their properties, and conduct business activities. However, the town remained closed to the general public and unauthorized traffic. Safety measures, including limited vehicle access with restriction on certain types of transportation, constraints on essential services and a prepared evacuation plan, were established. The area, under continuous surveillance, is still considered dangerous. Residents were advised to keep records of valuables taken and to contact their insurance companies, and to be cautious as houses might be unsafe. However, a resident of Grindav\u00edk was later caught staying at his home with his wife for several nights and was threatened with arrest.\n\nThe earthquakes in Grindav\u00edk significantly affected infrastructure and homes. Around 120 properties suffered damage, with between 10 and 20 being deemed uninhabitable. Two weeks following the earthquakes, a thorough damage assessment was initiated and was ongoing. The estimated total cost of the damages is up to 10 billion ISK. Property owners facing irreparable damage to their homes were obligated to allocate a segment of their insurance compensation\u2014earmarked primarily for on-site repairs or reconstruction\u2014to cover a disposal fee. In cases where rebuilding at the original location was not permitted, property owners were then allowed to use their insurance proceeds to buy homes elsewhere.\nBlue Lagoon\n\nThe management of the Blue Lagoon spa announced the site's closure to visitors from 9 to 16 November as a precaution following the earthquakes. Rocks dislodged by the earthquakes were reported to have fallen onto roads in the area, and 30 guests left the resort following a 4.8 tremor in the early hours of 9 November. In addition to these safety concerns, the closure was also implemented to reduce increased stress on staff. The management has assured that all staff will receive their full salaries during the closure period. Furthermore, guests who were evacuated as a result of the tremor will be provided with a full refund.\n\nHelga \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir, CEO of the Blue Lagoon, confirmed that the seismic activity at Svartsengi caused no visible damage or structural impairment to their facilities. The buildings, designed for earthquake resilience, remained intact and structurally sound. The Blue Lagoon temporarily ceased operations as a precautionary measure due to the earthquakes.\n\nThe administrators of the Blue Lagoon subsequently extended the closure announcement five times due to continuing geological activity, with the anticipated reopening date set for 17 December. Staff members of the Blue Lagoon were seen bathing in the spa's geothermal waters on 8 December. Prior to reopening, the staff were trained in evacuation procedures to ensure preparedness for any emergencies, while the administration prepared an evacuation process, expected to take around two hours in case of emergency. Additionally, guests were to be informed about the current situation.\n\nThe Blue Lagoon remained open for just two days before it closed again after the 18 December eruption only 2 to 3 kilometres (1.2 to 1.9 mi) away. All guests and staff were evacuated from the site roughly one to two hours before the eruption. The Blue Lagoon reopened on 6 January, with all facilities back in operation by 10 January. However, it was shut down once again on 14 January but reopened on 20 January. It was safely evacuated at the start of the 8 February eruption but was cut off by a fast-moving lava flow engulfing its main access road from the north.\nSvartsengi Power Station\n\nSince the state of emergency was declared, the Svartsengi Power Station has been unoccupied and is being remotely controlled from the Reykjanes Power Station. The management of the power station expected to maintain this remote operation mode until the end of 2023. The Reykjanes Power Station is equipped to generate electricity in case the Svartsengi line is cut off. The capability to deliver hot water, a critical function of the Svartsengi Power Station, cannot be replicated by the Reykjanes facility.\n\nThe power station experienced minimal impact from the earthquakes, with the only damage being \"the interior furnishings and exterior walls, as well as considerable cracking in pathways and remote areas of the site.\" Despite these issues, the power station continued to maintain its usual production levels of hot and cold water, as well as electricity.

Another factor which limits the scope of nationalist insurgency is the lack of support from locals as majority of locals don't support separatist groups. Locals support political parties who use legislature to address their grievances.\nHuman rights issues\nMain article: Human rights violations in Balochistan\n\nHuman Right Organisations have held Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) responsible for ethnic cleansing in the province as Brahamdagh Bugti (alleged leader of BLA), during a TV interview on 15 April 2009, urged separatists to kill non-Baloch residing in Balochistan. His actions allegedly lead to the death of 500 non-Baloch citizens in the province. According to The Economist around 800 non-Baloch settlers and Baloch have been killed by Baloch militant groups since 2006. Similarly, Human Right Watch have also held Baloch militants groups like Baloch liberation army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation United Front (BLUF) to be responsible for attacks on schools, teachers and students in the province. As a result, many teachers have sought transfer to secure areas such as Quetta or have moved out of province entirely. Separatist militants groups have also claimed responsibility for attacking and killing Journalists in the province. Apart from Human Right Organisations, Baloch separatists themselves have accused each other of being involved in Human right violations.\n\nIn the period 2003 to 2012, it is estimated that 8000 people were abducted by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan. In 2008 alone, more than 1100 Baloch people disappeared. There have also been reports of torture. An increasing number of bodies \"with burn marks, broken limbs, nails pulled out, and sometimes with holes drilled in their heads\" are being found on roadsides as the result of a \"kill and dump\" campaign allegedly conducted by Pakistani security forces, particularly Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Frontier Corps (FC). A 2013 report from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan identified ISI and Frontier Corps as the perpetrators for many disappearances, while noting a more cooperative stance from these agencies in recent years as perceived by local police forces. The Pakistan Rangers are also alleged to have committed a vast number of human rights violations in the region. No one has been held responsible for the crimes. However, Pakistani security officials have rejected all the allegations made against them. Major General Obaid Ullah Khan claim that Baloch militants are using Frontier Corps (FC) uniform to kidnap people and malign the good name of Frontier Corps. Baloch militants have also been found using military uniform which resembles the one used by Frontier Corps while carrying out their activities. A senior Pakistani provincial security official claims that missing person figures are 'exaggerated', that 'in Balochistan, insurgents, immigrants who fled to Europe and even those who have been killed in military operations are declared as missing persons'. Reports have shown that many people have fled the province to seek asylum in other countries because of the unrest caused by separatist militants.\n\nMilitant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi have systematically targeted Shia Muslims in Balochistan, with about 600 being killed in attacks in recent years.\n\nDuring a camp at Broken Chair, Geneva, Baloch Republican Party (BRP) leader Sher Baz Bugti alleged that Baloch youth, women and children were kept in \"torture cells\".

Many are innocent and stuck in Pakistan's slow court system whilst others are in prison awaiting charges on a range of things such as gun smuggling and robbery. The chief justice of an apex court of Pakistan asked about the situation and said it was going out of control in Balochistan. The Supreme Court is currently investigating the \"missing persons\" and issued an arrest warrant for the former Military Dictator Pervez Musharaff. Furthermore, the Chief Justice of the court said the military must act under the government's direction and follow well-defined parameters set by the Constitution.\nMissing people found\n\nIn June 2011, the prime minister was informed that 41 missing people had returned to their homes, false cases against 38 had been withdrawn and several others had been traced. The PM urged police to trace the missing people and help them to return to their homes. In 2011, government established a commission which registered 5,369 missing person's complaints. The commission claims to have traced more than 3,600 people. In October 2018, Balochistan National Party (Mengal) (BNP-M) claimed that around 300 missing Baloch persons had returned their homes. Similarly in January 2019, Voice of Baloch Missing People (VBMP) decided to end their suspend their protest after around dozens of returned to their homes. VBMP gave a list of 110 missing people which the VBMP expects the government recover them within two months.\n\nOn 29 June 2019, around 200 missing Baloch people were recovered according to Balochistan Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove. According to Mir Ziaullah Langove VBMP had provided provincial authorities a list of 250 missing people and that the commission on enforced disappearances was also hearing about 40 cases of missing persons.\nSupreme Court orders\n\nThe Supreme Court apex court headed by Justice Iqbal decided ordered the government to the grant of subsistence allowance to the affected families. Justice Iqbal advised families not to lose hope. He said the issue of missing persons had become a chronic problem and, therefore, the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, constituted on the orders of the apex court, should be made permanent.\nEffect of and remedies for the insurgency\nDevelopment issues\n\nThe government of Pakistan has repeatedly stated its intention to bring industrialisation to Balochistan, and continues to claim that progress has been made by way of the \"Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan\" package of political and economic reforms issued in 2009. This is challenged by Baloch nationalist groups, who argue the benefits of these policies have not accrued to native Baloch residents of the province.[citation needed] Baloch nationalist groups continue to highlight the extraction of natural resources, especially natural gas, from the province, without discernible economic benefit to the Baloch people.[citation needed] Nonetheless, the government of Pakistan continues to insist that industrial zones are planned along the new Gawadar-Karachi highway. According to the government, this development is envisaged to bring accelerated progress in the future for the Baloch.[citation needed]\n\nIn February 2006 three Chinese engineers assisting in the construction of a local cement factory were shot and killed in an attack on their automobile, while another 11 injured in a car bomb attack by BLA.[citation needed] China recalled its engineers working on the project in Balochistan.[citation needed] The progress in the hydro-power sector has been slow since then.\n\nThe people of the region have largely maintained a nomadic lifestyle marked by poverty and illiteracy.

At the end of December 2023, Israeli television station Keshet 12 reported the ruling in advance based on a leaked draft of the decision. The bill was struck down by the Supreme Court, in its role as the High Court of Justice, on 1 January 2024 by a vote of 8\u20137. The justices also ruled 12\u20133 that the court has the power to overturn Basic Laws.\n\nEach justice wrote their own opinion.

Justice Stein agreed in upholding the court's ability to strike down laws, writing that \"the Knesset never received the authority to pass any law it pleased\", but voted with the minority in favor of the proposed reform, finding that it \"violates no constitutional norm\". Sohlberg, meanwhile, wrote that \"frail legal constructs\" did not mean the court could overrule the Knesset.\nProposed changes\nJudicial selection\nCurrent system\n\nThe Judicial Selection Committee is composed of nine members.

Selection of judges to all courts require a simple majority of the committee, but selection of Supreme Court judges require the approval of seven out of the nine members on the committee, granting essentially veto powers to either the three judges or the representatives of the ruling Parliamentary coalition.\n\nAccording to the Israel Democracy Institute, the effect of the current system is one of consensus, in that \"the selection of Supreme Court justices has mandated the consent of the politicians on the [Committee], because a majority of seven of its nine members must support a successful candidate. By the same token, the politicians cannot select judges without the agreement of the justices on the committee. This principle has generally produced a consensus on a slate of new justices.\"", "The 2023 Israeli judicial reform is a set of five changes to the judicial system and the balance of powers in Israel that was proposed in January 2023. The intent of the measures is to curb the judiciary's influence over lawmaking and public policy by limiting the Supreme Court's power to exercise judicial review, granting the government control over judicial appointments and limiting the authority of its legal advisors. The effort was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Yariv Levin and the Chair of the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, Simcha Rothman.\n\nThe Supreme Court has, for several decades, assumed the right to declare Knesset legislation unconstitutional. The reform would permit the Knesset to override such a ruling by reintroducing the legislation and approving it with a majority of Knesset members. The reform would additionally diminish the ability of courts to conduct judicial review of the Basic Laws and change the makeup of the Judicial Selection Committee, so that control over the appointment of judges is effectively given to the government.\n\nLevin and the ruling government coalition have stated that the above is the first step in their judicial reform, and that additional steps are planned, including changing the appointment process of legal advisors to government ministries, such that they are appointed and dismissed by the ministers; making their legal advice a recommendation rather than binding on the ministers; and making them subordinate directly to the ministers rather than to the Justice Ministry's professional oversight. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that the reform is necessary because the judiciary has too much control over public policy, and a better balance is needed between democratically elected legislators and the judiciary. However, Netanyahu has been barred from actively taking part in the process of the judicial reform by the Attorney General, due to a conflict of interest stemming from his ongoing corruption trial.\n\nThe coalition is also advancing a number of other bills concerning Israel's judicial system and the balance of powers, including reforms to widen the authority of the Rabbinical Court, allowing them to act as arbitrators in civil matters using religious law, if both parties consent; bills limiting the ability to call for a no-confidence vote and other methods for dissolving a sitting Knesset; bills prohibiting criminal proceedings against sitting Prime Ministers; and bills permitting key public service positions to be positions of trust appointed by politicians rather than professional appointments.\n\nThe proposed reform has sparked significant backlash, as well as some support, both inside and outside of Israel. Opposition leaders and activists accused the government of undermining established norms of checks and balances and attempting to seize absolute power, with some arguing the reform amounts to an attempt at regime change. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, has called for the reforms to be halted to allow for a wider consultative process, and the president of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General have attested to the reform's illegalities. Protests against the reform escalated in Israel shortly after its introduction, as did significant concern among some in the international community.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, after public protests and general strikes, Netanyahu announced a pause in the reform process to allow for dialogue with opposition parties. However, negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise collapsed in June, and the government resumed its plans to unilaterally pass parts of the legislation. On 24 July 2023, the Knesset passed a bill that curbs the power of the Supreme Court to declare government decisions unreasonable; on 1 January 2024, the Supreme Court struck the bill down.\nBackground\nSee also: Thirty-seventh government of Israel \u00a7 Controversies\nDemonstrators against the judicial reform in Haifa, 11 January 2023.

The insurgency fell into decline after a return to the four-province structure and the abolishment of the Sardari system.\nFifth conflict, 2004\u2013present\nSee also: Turbat killings\n\nIn early 2005, the rape of a female doctor (Shazia Khalid) at the Sui gas facility re-ignited another long running conflict.[citation needed] Her case and the unusual comment by then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf about the controversy, stating on national television that the accused rapist, an officer identified only as Captain Hammad, was \"not guilty\", led to a violent uprising by the Bugti tribe, disrupting the supply of gas to much of the country for several weeks. In 2005, the Baluch political leaders Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti and Mir Balach Marri presented a 15-point agenda to the Pakistan government. Their stated demands included greater control of the province's resources and a moratorium on the construction of military bases. On 15 December 2005 the inspector general of the Frontier Corps, Major General Shujaat Zamir Dar, and his deputy Brigadier Salim Nawaz (the current IGFC) were wounded after shots were fired at their helicopter in Balochistan Province. The provincial interior secretary later said that, after visiting Kohlu, \"both of them were wounded in the leg but both are in stable condition.\"\n\nHowever, a leaked 2006 cable from the Embassy of the United States, Islamabad noted that,\n\n    \"There seems to be little support in the province, beyond the Bugti tribe, for the current insurgency.\"\n\nIn August 2006, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, 79 years old, was killed in fighting against the Pakistan Army, in which at least 60 Pakistani soldiers and 7 officers were also killed. Pakistan's government had charged him with responsibility for a series of deadly bomb blasts and a rocket attack on President Pervez Musharraf.\n\nIn April 2009, Baloch National Movement president Ghulam Mohammed Baloch and two other nationalist leaders (Lala Munir and Sher Muhammad) were seized from a small legal office and were allegedly \"handcuffed, blindfolded and hustled into a waiting pickup truck which is in still [sic] use of intelligence forces in front of their lawyer and neighboring shopkeepers.\" The gunmen were allegedly speaking in Persian (a national language of neighbouring Afghanistan and Iran). Five days later, on 8 April, their bullet-riddled bodies were found in a commercial area. The BLA claimed Pakistani forces were behind the killings, though international experts have deemed it odd that the Pakistani forces would be careless enough to allow the bodies to be found so easily and \"light Balochistan on fire\" (Herald) if they were truly responsible. The discovery of the bodies sparked rioting and weeks of strikes, demonstrations, and civil resistance in cities and towns around Balochistan.\n\nOn 12 August 2009, Khan of Kalat Mir Suleiman Dawood declared himself ruler of Balochistan and formally announced a Council for Independent Balochistan. The council's claimed domain includes Sistan and Baluchestan Province, as well as Pakistani Balochistan, but does not include Afghan Baloch regions. The council claimed the allegiance of \"all separatist leaders including Nawabzada Bramdagh Bugti.\" Suleiman Dawood stated that the UK had a \"moral responsibility to raise the issue of Balochistan's illegal occupation at international level.\"\n\nThe Economist wrote:\n\n    \"[The Baloch separatists] are supported\u2014with money, influence or sympathy\u2014by some members of the powerful Bugti tribe and by parts of the Baloch middle class.

The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province's inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.\n\nThe Khan of Kalat lent great support to the Pakistan Movement but also desired to declare independence. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it clear that the princely states with the lapse of British paramountcy would have to join either India or Pakistan, keeping in mind their geographic and demographic compulsions.\n\nOn 19 July, Mountbatten called a Round Table Conference meeting between representatives of the State of Kalat and Government of Pakistan. Mountbatten discussed with them the status of the Kalat State. The representatives of Kalat argued that Kalat, as per the treaty of 1876, was an independent and sovereign state and not an Indian state. Mountbatten accepted this position for the purpose of negotiation, although Kalat had always been a princely state. Thus, Mountbatten confined the topic of discussion to the leased areas of Quetta, Nushki, Nasirabad and Bolan. He explained that Pakistan rejected Kalat's claims that these areas should be returned to Kalat.\n\nPakistan's position was that it would inherit all treaty obligations incurred by India to the foreign states. Kalat argued that the leases clearly stated that the other party besides Kalat was the British Government alone. Kalat argued that it was a personal agreement and there was no provision that the leases to the British would be inherited by others. Therefore, since the agreement was between Kalat and the British Government, Pakistan could not be the latter's successor party.\n\nPakistan did not agree that the agreement was personal as personal agreements by nature implied that only a particular person was involved. Mountbatten also said that according to international law, treaties such as the one being discussed were inherited by successors and not invalidated by a transfer of power. Mountbatten also suggested that in case there was no agreement the matter could be put before an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nKalat wished to have further discussions on the matter. Kalat also argued that in case of a vote in the leased areas between joining Kalat and joining Pakistan then the vote would go in favour of the former. Pakistan did not agree that the vote would have such a result.\n\nKalat also expressed its deepest desire to remain on friendly terms with Pakistan and stated that it understood that Jinnah, who was anxious for a correct decision, wanted more time to study the issues between Kalat and Pakistan. Mountbatten, however, suggested that Jinnah not be brought into the discussions.\n\nMountbatten insisted that Kalat and Pakistan sign a standstill agreement, which both countries did. The Standstill Agreement also stipulated that both parties would discuss as soon as possible about their relationship concerning Defence and External Affairs. According to the Article I, 'The Government of Pakistan agrees that Kalat is an independent State, being quite different in status from other States of India'. However, the Article IV stated:\n\n    a standstill agreement will be made between Pakistan and Kalat by which Pakistan shall stand committed to all the responsibilities agreements signed by Kalat and the British Government from 1839 to 1947 and by this, Pakistan shall be the legal, constitutional and political successor of the British.\n\nThrough this agreement, the British Paramountcy was effectively transferred to Pakistan.\n\nHowever, without making any agreement with Pakistan and in violation of the Standstill Agreement the Khan of Kalat declared independence. Later on, the ruler of Kalat unconditionally signed an Instrument of Accession with Pakistan on 27 March 1948, contrary to the wishes of his state's legislature, being the last of all princely states to do so.\nFirst conflict\n\nBalochistan contained a Chief Commissioner's province and four princely states under the British Raj. The province's Shahi Jirga and the non-official members of the Quetta Municipality opted for Pakistan unanimously on 29 June 1947. Three of the princely states, Makran, Las Bela and Kharan, acceded to Pakistan in 1947 after independence. But the ruler of the fourth princely state, the Khan of Kalat, Ahmad Yar Khan, who used to call Jinnah his 'father', declared Kalat's independence as this was one of the options given to all of the 535 princely states by British Prime Minister Clement Attlee."]}, {"query": "Which historical figure, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the film \"Napoleon\" (2023), was criticized by French critics for being \"lazy, pointless, boring, migraine-inducing, too short and historically inaccurate\"?", "response": "Napoleon Bonaparte", "contexts": ["Napoleon is a 2023 epic historical drama film directed and produced by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa.

They argue that these actions by Hamas constitute a significant violation of international law and were carried out with the intent to destroy the Israeli national group. Some commentators highlight Hamas's founding charter, which calls for the destruction of Israel; this has led to suggestions that its intent is genocidal and that the attacks on 7 October were an attempt to fulfill this agenda.\n\nIn a 12 October preliminary legal assessment condemning Hamas's attacks in Israel, international humanitarian law scholar and Dean of Cornell Law School Jens David Ohlin said the evidence suggested Hamas's \"killings and kidnappings\" potentially violated Articles 6\u20138 of the Rome Statute as well as the Genocide Convention and were \"crimes against humanity\"; over a hundred international scholars expressed support for this position.\nSexual and gender-based violence\nMain article: Sexual and gender-based violence in the 7 October attack on Israel\n\nDuring the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities, Israeli women and girls were reportedly raped, assaulted, and mutilated by Hamas militants, an allegation that Hamas denies.

It concluded that these were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence during the 7 October massacres. The probe was based on video footage, photographs, GPS data from mobile phones and interviews with more than 150 people. The newspaper's probe concluded that Hamas \"weaponized sexual violence\" during the attacks. Israeli police said dozens of women and some men were raped. The New York Times reported that \"videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers.\"\n\nThese acts were denounced as gender-based violence, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, aligning with the International Criminal Court's recognition of sexual violence as such."]}, {"query": "Which world leaders expressed their condolences to the Chilean people following the death of former Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era?

Bolivia's minister of the presidency demanded an end to the attacks on the Gaza Strip, while Chilean President Gabriel Boric cited Israel's \"collective punishment of the Palestinian civilian population\" and Columbian President Gustavo Petro cited the \"massacre of the Palestinian people\". Jordan's Foreign Minister cited an \"unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe\" and condemned the \"Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza\". Bahrain's National Assembly additionally cut off all economic relations, citing a \"solid and historical stance that supports the Palestinian cause and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\" This decision does not appear to have been implemented. Honduras' Minister of Foreign Affairs cited Israel's violations of international humanitarian law.

In contrast, 50.5% of Israeli Arabs believed that the Israeli military was using \"too much\" firepower in Gaza. According to a survey by the Israel Democracy Institute, only 10% of Israeli Jews would support a pause in the war in Gaza to allow an exchange of Israeli hostages.\n\nFollowing the Hamas attack on Israel, the protest group Kaplan Force cancelled its protest against the Israeli judicial reform scheduled on 7 October, instead extending support to the IDF amidst the crisis. Other protest groups like Forum 555 and Brothers in Arms also urged reservists to serve if called up. The Israeli government distributed weapons to civilians.", "On 9 November, Israel agreed to daily four-hour \"humanitarian pauses\" to allow civilians to obtain food and medicine, as well as evacuate to the south. Evacuees described the evacuation path as full of death and horror. Jan Egeland, the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said on 5 December that \"The pulverising of Gaza now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age. Each day we see more dead children and new depths of suffering for the innocent people enduring this hell\".\n\nOn 12 December, the UN General Assembly once again voted overwhelmingly for a resolution on immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza and aid access. The resolution attracted 153 votes in favor and 23 abstentions; 10 countries voted against, namely Israel, the United States, Austria, the Czech Republic, Guatemala, Liberia, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea and Paraguay.\n\nDue to an agreement reportedly brokered by Qatar and France between Israel and Hamas, medicine was scheduled to leave Doha via two military aircraft and be delivered to the Gaza Strip on 17 January 2024 to aid hostages. The medicine was successfully delivered.\nAllegations of war crimes\nMain article: War crimes in the Israel\u2013Hamas war\nSee also: Israel\u2013Hamas war hostage crisis\n\nBoth Hamas and the IDF have been accused of attempted or imminent genocide, and several other war crimes, based on their actions in the war.\n\nThe International Criminal Court issued a statement on 10 October confirming that its mandate to investigate alleged war crimes committed since June 2014 in the State of Palestine extends to the current conflict. ICC prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan visited the Rafah crossing and said \"the ICC is independently looking at the situation in Palestine,\" including \"events in Israel and allegations that Palestinian nationals have also committed crime.\" The UN Human Rights Council said it had \"clear evidence\" of war crimes by both sides. The Permanent United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Israel Palestine conflict said there is \"clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable.\"\n2023 Hamas attack on Israel\nGenocide accusations\nMain articles: Allegations of genocide in the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel\n\nSeveral experts in international law and genocide studies characterized Hamas's assault as genocide. Legal and genocide experts have condemned the attack, during which 1,139 people were killed, including 695 Israeli civilians. They argue that these actions by Hamas constitute a significant violation of international law and were carried out with the intent to destroy the Israeli national group. Some commentators highlight Hamas's founding charter, which calls for the destruction of Israel; this has led to suggestions that its intent is genocidal and that the attacks on 7 October were an attempt to fulfill this agenda.\n\nIn a 12 October preliminary legal assessment condemning Hamas's attacks in Israel, international humanitarian law scholar and Dean of Cornell Law School Jens David Ohlin said the evidence suggested Hamas's \"killings and kidnappings\" potentially violated Articles 6\u20138 of the Rome Statute as well as the Genocide Convention and were \"crimes against humanity\"; over a hundred international scholars expressed support for this position.\nSexual and gender-based violence\nMain article: Sexual and gender-based violence in the 7 October attack on Israel\n\nDuring the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities, Israeli women and girls were reportedly raped, assaulted, and mutilated by Hamas militants, an allegation that Hamas denies. In the months following the attacks, The Wall Street Journal reported on 21 December, there was \"mounting evidence of sexual violence, based on survivor accounts, first responders and witnesses.\" A two-month New York Times investigation, released in late December 2023, found at least seven locations where sexual assaults and mutilations of Israeli women and girls were carried out. It concluded that these were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence during the 7 October massacres. The probe was based on video footage, photographs, GPS data from mobile phones and interviews with more than 150 people. The newspaper's probe concluded that Hamas \"weaponized sexual violence\" during the attacks. Israeli police said dozens of women and some men were raped. The New York Times reported that \"videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers.\"\n\nThese acts were denounced as gender-based violence, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, aligning with the International Criminal Court's recognition of sexual violence as such."]}, {"query": "Which Chilean cities, specifically named, were affected by the deadliest wildfires in Chile's history in February 2023, resulting in the evacuation of hospitals and nursing homes, and causing significant damage to buildings and homes, with a reported death toll of over 130 people?", "response": "\nThe following Chilean cities were affected by the deadliest wildfires in Chile's history in February 2023:\n\n1.

The Chilean Forensic Medical Service said many bodies were found to be in bad condition and difficult to identify, prompting them to take DNA samples from people with missing relatives.[43] At least 45 of the dead were found at the scene, while six others died of burn injuries in medical facilities. At least 14,000 houses were affected by the fires in Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Quilpu\u00e9. Over 370 people were reported missing in the Vi\u00f1a del Mar area alone, while 1,600 others were displaced by the fires.[44] The fires were regarded as the deadliest in Chile's history, and the deadliest disaster in the country since the 2010 Chile earthquake.[45]\n\nIn Valpara\u00edso, four hospitals and three nursing homes were evacuated, and two bus terminals were destroyed.

President Gabriel Boric ordered the deployment of more military units to help tackle the fires and urged citizens to cooperate with emergency teams. Additionally, a curfew was implemented in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Limache, Quilpu\u00e9, and Villa Alemana beginning at 09:00 pm on 3 February to facilitate the movement of emergency vehicles.[45][48] Authorities ordered a ban on handling fire and other heat-producing machines in Valpara\u00edso and Marga Marga provinces.[49]\n\nA state of emergency was declared on 3 February, while Boric declared two days of national mourning. On 3 February, Boric went in a flyover over the affected areas before visiting a school that had been converted into a shelter for those displaced by the fires. He also ordered the conversion of the official presidential summer residence, the Palace of Cerro Castillo, in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, into a temporary leisure center for affected children[44] and the donation of furniture that had been used in the 2023 Pan American Games, as well as the forgiveness of the water bills of 9,200 households.[43]\n\nThe health ministry issued a health alert over the Valparaiso Region and ordered the suspension of elective surgeries. It also authorized the establishment of field hospitals and announced the hiring of medical students nearing the end of their studies to augment medical responders.[49]\nReactions\n\nThe Vi\u00f1a del Mar Festival canceled its opening gala in mourning for the victims. Some participants such as Alejandro Sanz, Pablo Albor\u00e1n and Man\u00e1 sent messages of solidarity and announced donations.[43]\n\nThe government of Mexico sent a team of 30 firefighters from the National Forestry Commission and 127 Army and Air Force personnel,[50] together with 26 tons of food supplies.[51] US President Joe Biden said that Washington \"is in contact with our Chilean partners\" and \"is ready to provide necessary assistance to the Chilean people\".[52] Pope Francis called for prayers for the \"dead and wounded in the devastating fires in Chile\".[45] The United Nations offered condolences and announced assistance.[43]", "In February 2024, a series of wildfires broke out in Chile, affecting multiple regions including Valpara\u00edso, O'Higgins, Maule, Biob\u00edo, and Los Lagos. The most severe incidents occurred in the Valpara\u00edso Region as of 5 February 2024. The Chilean government labeled the fires as the country's worst disaster since the 2010 Chile earthquake, and declared a two-day national mourning period.\nOverview\n\nDeputy Interior Minister Manuel Monsalve reported on 4 February that there were 162 forest fires across central and southern Chile. The region experienced unusually high temperatures, reaching up to 40 \u00baC (104 \u00baF) in the past week, worsened by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and a \"mega-drought\" that has affected the country over the last decade.[10] Over 43,000 hectares of land were affected. As of 4 February, authorities had managed to bring 43 fires under control, while 34 were still being dealt with.[11]\n\nPresident Gabriel Boric suggested that some fires might have been intentionally started, a view supported by Valpara\u00edso Region Governor Rodrigo Mundaca.[12]\nPreceding fires\n\nIn January 2024, two forest fires prompted the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response (SENAPRED) to issue a red alert. One occurred on 20 January in Lonquimay, Araucan\u00eda Region, and another on 26 January in Puerto Montt, Los Lagos Region.[13]\n\nOn 22 January, a fire, named \"Antiquereo 2\", broke out on the boundary of Portezuelo and Trehuaco in the \u00d1uble Region.[14] It was contained by 24 January after consuming 35 hectares (86 acres).[15] SENAPRED responded by declaring a yellow alert in Portezuelo, marking the first alert of the year in the region.[16]\n\nBy the end of January 2024, a fire originating in Florida, Biob\u00edo Region, spread to Quill\u00f3n in the \u00d1uble Region.[17] The \"Casablanca\" fire,[18] covering 69.5 hectares (172 acres) in the Pe\u00f1ablanca sector,[19] was extinguished through collaborative efforts between the Quill\u00f3n and Florida fire departments.[20]\n\nIn the last week of January 2024, a heatwave hit central Chile, with temperatures 10 to 15 \u00b0C (50 to 59 \u00b0F) above the weekly average. Anticipating an increased wildfire risk, the Meteorological Directorate of Chile issued a heat alert on 28 January, projecting temperatures of 36 to 38 \u00b0C (97 to 100 \u00b0F) in valleys and foothills of the central zone and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on the coast of Valpara\u00edso, O'Higgins, and Maule regions.[21]\nBy region\nValpara\u00edso Region\n\nThousands of people in the Valpara\u00edso Region, which have had the deadliest wildfires, were urged to evacuate by the authorities.[22]\n\nAt 3:25 on 2 February, a red alert was declared in Valpara\u00edso Province due to a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) fire that affected the Las Docas road, south of Valpara\u00edso. An hour later, it was announced that the fire affected 5 hectares (12 acres) of land.[23] At 3:10 p.m., another set of fires was reported in the Lago Pe\u00f1uelas National Reserve, affecting 30 hectares (74 acres). The fire was described as one of \"rapid advance and high intensity\", and caused the interruption of vehicular traffic on Routes 68 and F-718.[23] Another fire was reported in Lo Moscoso at 3:54 p.m., affecting 8 hectares (20 acres) in the communes of Quilpu\u00e9 and Villa Alemana. At the same time, authorities placed the Marga Marga province on red alert.[23]\n\nSENAPRED reported that the Lo Moscoso fire extended to 80 hectares (200 acres) at 5:15 p.m., and ordered the evacuation of the Quebrada Escobares and Fundo El Rinc\u00f3n sectors of Villa Alemana. By then, the fire in the Lago Pe\u00f1uelas Reserve had affected \u200b\u200b480 hectares (1,200 acres).[23] By 9:00 p.m., Los Andes, Petorca, Quillota, San Antonio and San Felipe de Aconcagua provinces were also placed on red alert.[24] By 10:00 p.m."]}, {"query": "Which drivers, specifically mentioned in the interview, contribute to the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan, and how do economic and development issues factor into these drivers?", "response": "\n\nThe drivers of the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan, specifically mentioned in the interview, are:\n\n1. Historical shortage of skilled labor in Balochistan: The importation of skilled workers from other regions has caused tensions in the region, leading to resentment among the local inhabitants.\n2. Military response: The military's harsh response to the insurgency has led to a spiral of violence, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of civilians and armed personnel.\n3. Economic issues: The shortage of skilled workers and goods, as well as the lack of development in the region, has contributed to the insurgency. The people of the region have largely maintained a nomadic lifestyle marked by poverty and illiteracy, and the indigenous people are continuously threatened by war and other means of oppression.\n\nIn terms of economic and development issues, the interview highlights the following factors:\n\n1. Lack of development in the region: The government of Pakistan has not invested adequately in the development of Balochistan, leading to a lack of infrastructure and basic amenities.\n2. Shortage of skilled workers: The importation of skilled workers from other regions has created a shortage of skilled labor in Balochistan, leading to resentment among the local inhabitants.\n3. High prices of food items: The killing of rice traders from Punjab has resulted in higher prices of food items in Balochistan.\n4. Personal development budget: Each Member of the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan has a personal development budget of 180 million for his or her constituency, which has not addressed the deep political issues in the region.\n5. Corruption: Allegations of corruption amongst civil servants and senior ministers may mean that the common man only gets partial benefit from the federal programmes.\n\nIn conclusion, the drivers of the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan are primarily economic and related to the lack of development and investment in the region, as well as the military response to the insurgency. The interview highlights the importance of addressing these underlying issues to resolve the conflict in the region.", "contexts": ["Baloch complain that construction of the port relies on Chinese engineers and labourers, and few Balochs have been employed. A parallel town for workers at Gwadar is being built close to the old one to segregate Balochs from the growing influx of outsiders.\n\nThe Pakistani government has stationed soldiers in the area to secure it from insurgent attacks.\nMulticulturalism and immigration\n\nDue to the historical shortage of skilled labour in Balochistan, skilled workers are often imported from other regions. Their arrival means new industries can develop, boosting the local economy; however, nationalists argue that this creates resentment amongst the local inhabitants.\n\nAfter the Soviet invasion, around 4 million refugees from Afghanistan arrived and settled in the region which has resulted in substantial demographic imbalance. Perceived marginalisation as a result of increased Pashtun migration from Afghanistan during the Afghan War drives the insurgency.\nEducation issues\n\nA major factor in the Balouchistan conflict is education, which nationalists feel has been neglected. The government of Pakistan recognises that importing skilled labour from other regions has caused tensions in the region, and has thus sought to encourage scholarships for Balochi students so they can participate in development programmes. The quota for Baloch students in Punjab university was doubled in 2010 under the Cheema Long Scheme, on the order of CM Shabaz Sharif. The provincial governments of Sindh, Punjab and KP said they would take steps to encourage Balochistan students to enroll and benefit from 100% scholarships.\nMilitary response\n\nMany Balochis have not tended to look favourably on Pakistan and the army's intervention in politics as they see the military as dominated by Punjabis and the interests of the Punjabis (who make up 45% of Pakistan's population) and lacking Baloch representation.\n\nIn the insurgencies themselves, the military's \"harsh response\" has led to \"a spiral of violence\". (See Human Rights Issues below.) A report by the Pakistan Security Research Unit notes, \"Islamabad's militarized approach has led to ... violence, widespread human rights abuses, mass internal displacement and the deaths of hundreds of civilians and armed personnel.\"\n\nAccording to the International Crisis Group the attempt to crush the insurgency as in earlier insurgencies is feeding Baloch disaffection. Moderate Balochs have been alienated from the government by the imprisonment of civilians without charges, and routine kidnapping of dissidents.[Note 1]\nForeign support\nAfghanistan\nMain articles: Afghanistan-Pakistan relations and Durand Line\n\nAfghanistan has provided sanctuary and training to Baloch separatists in 1948, in the mid-1950s, and more vigorously under the regime of Afghan President Mohammed Daoud Khan. In the 1970s, Daoud Khan's government established training camps in Afghanistan, at Kabul and Kandahar, for Baloch rebels. These were the first modern training camps in the country. The camps in Kabul were under the supervision and control of Republican guards.\n\nThe former Pakistani ambassador to the US, Hussain Haqqani, wrote that in the 1970s training camps were set up in Afghanistan by Daoud to support Baloch separatists in Pakistan. According to a student paper, \"Pakistan's fear that a communist Afghanistan would embolden the Baloch and Pashtun Marxist separatists in the western Pakistani province of Balochistan was confirmed when Daoud began supporting Marxist Baloch and Pashtun groups in eastern Afghanistan\".\n\n    As president, Daoud started antagonising Pakistan [...] He set up a training camp outside Kandahar for Baluch rebels to foment trouble across the border in Pakistan...\n    \u2014\u200aChristian Parenti, Tropic of Chaos: Climate Change and the New Geography of Violence (2011), p.103\n\nDaoud Khan ended hostilities against Pakistan following a 1975 Panjshir uprising led by Ahmad Shah Massoud against Khan's government. Visiting Pakistan in 1976, and again in 1978, Daoud Khan expressed his desire for peace between the two countries. In 1978, however, he was removed from office by a communist coup in Afghanistan, after which Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power and established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Nur Muhammad Taraki reopened the Baloch training camps in Afghanistan and once again started offering arms and aid to Baloch rebels.\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks cables published in 2010, the then-president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, had been providing shelter to Brahumdagh Bugti for several years.

The intensity of the eruption and accompanying seismic activity decreased early on 19 December 2023, with lava seen spreading laterally from both sides of the newly opened fissures. The eruption was described as the largest in the Reykjanes Peninsula since the beginning of eruptive activity in 2021, with lava fountains, up to 100 metres (330 ft) high, and was visible as far away as the capital Reykjav\u00edk, 42 kilometres (26 mi) away.

Seven intrusions have occurred in the Eldv\u00f6rp-Svartsengi volcanic system since December 2019, with the latest two contributing to the current eruption series. Prior intrusions did not result in an eruption. Volcanic unrest on the peninsula during this period had mostly been associated with the Fagradalsfjall system, where three out of four confirmed magmatic intrusions culminated in volcanic eruptions.\n\nAlthough earthquakes are a frequent occurrence in Iceland due to the island's location, straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, the recent swarm was noted for being more extensive than usual. A total of five identified volcanic eruptions have occurred in the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021.", "Officials said residents of Grindav\u00edk would be allowed back into the town.\n\nThe IMO said the eruption occurred at around 22:17 UTC following a series of small earthquakes at around 21:00. It pinpointed the origin of the eruption near Hagafell, about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) north-east of Grindav\u00edk, and noted that the eruption stemmed from a fissure with a length of about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi), with lava flowing at a rate of around 100 to 200 cubic metres per second adding that seismic activity appeared to be moving towards the direction of Grindav\u00edk.

Fissures were reported to have opened up on both sides of the anti-lava defences, and it was estimated that lava would reach the town within 24 hours. A successful mission was launched to save several pieces of heavy machinery used to construct the barriers. The lava cut off one of the main roads leading into Grindav\u00edk. The initial fissure reached a length of up to 900 metres (3,000 ft).\n\nAround noon, another fissure, measuring about 100 metres (330 ft), opened only metres from the outermost houses of the town and subsequently set three houses on fire before ceasing after a few hours.

The eruption produced lava fountains with a height measuring between 50 to 80 metres in height and a three-kilometer high volcanic plume. A three-kilometer long fissure opened in the same area as the December eruption, between the Sundhn\u00fakur craters and the hill of St\u00f3ra-Sk\u00f3gfell. The lava was reported to be flowing east and west at a safe distance from Grindav\u00edk, but caused damage to critical infrastructure around the Svartsengi power station. Unlike in the previous eruptions on the peninsula, the 8 February eruption produced quantities of black ash mixed with steam. This is theorised to be the result of groundwater boiling and mixing with magma to create ash.\nImpact\nClosure of the road to Grindav\u00edk\nGrindav\u00edk\n\nFollowing the 5.2 tremor on 10 November, a state of emergency was declared, and evacuation plans were put into effect for Grindav\u00edk. This culminated in the relocation of nearly 4,000 residents, nearly 1 percent of Iceland's entire population. The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management deployed the Icelandic Coast Guard Vessel \u00de\u00f3r to the area \"for safety purposes\". It also closed all roads to Grindav\u00edk except for emergency and evacuation purposes. On 13 November, authorities allowed residents to return briefly to the town to retrieve their belongings. Boat owners were also allowed to remove their vessels from the harbour.

Holbrooke also strongly rejected the allegation that India was using its consulates in Afghanistan to facilitate Baloch rebel activity, saying he had \"no reason to believe Islamabad's charges\", and that \"Pakistan would do well to examine its own internal problems\". In 2009, a Washington-based think tank, the Center for International Policy, published a report stating that no evidence of Indian involvement in Balochistan had been provided by Pakistan, and that the allegations made by Pakistan lacked credibility, as Baloch rebels had been fighting with \"ineffectual small arms\".\n\nIndia has categorically denied the allegations, pointing to Pakistan's failure to provide evidence.\n\nBrahamdagh Bugti stated in a 2008 interview that he would accept aid from India, Afghanistan, and Iran in defending Balochistan. When asked about the alleged links between his group and India, he is reported to have laughed and said, \"Would our people live amid such miserable conditions if we enjoyed support from India?\" Baloch National Front secretary Karima Baloch claims that the allegations against India are an \"excuse to label [the] ingrown Balochistan freedom movement as a proxy war to cover up the war crimes [the] Pakistani state has committed in Balochistan\".\n\nOn 29 March 2016, the Pakistani government announced that it had apprehended a serving Indian naval officer, Kulbhushan Yadav, who, in a video interview, admitted that he had been tasked by the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) with destabilizing Pakistan. The Indian government confirmed that Yadav was a former naval officer but denied that \"this individual was involved in subversive activities in Pakistan at our [the Indian government's] behest\", and asserted that he operated \"a legitimate business in Iran\", from where he may have been \"abducted\" by Pakistan or, alternatively, by the extremist militant organization Jaishul Adil.\n\nIn 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized Pakistan and alleged human rights issues in Balochistan during an Independence Day speech. Pakistan condemned Modi's remarks, calling it an attempted diversion from violence in Kashmir and a reiteration of Pakistani allegations vis-a-vis Indian involvement in Balochistan. Modi's comments were welcomed by exiled Baloch separatist leaders but sparked anti-India protests by political organizations and locals in Balochistan.\n\nOn 8 October 2015, the Indian newspaper The Hindu confirmed the presence of Balaach Pardili, a representative of the Balochistan Liberation Organisation (BLO), in India. Balaach Pardili hails from Afghanistan and has been living in Delhi since 2009. Hyrbyair Marri, leader of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), had assigned Pardili the task of representing him in public events in India. Mr. Pardili appeared in public on 4 October 2015, under the banner of Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena (BSKS). His presence in India angered Pakistan. A Pakistani diplomat stated that in response to Pardili's presence in India, Pakistan could take up the issue in India's troubled North-Eastern region.\n\nNaela Quadri Baloch and her son Mazdak Dilshad Baloch also live in India.

The ammunition and weaponry was believed to be destined for Baloch rebels. Pakistan responded by expelling and declaring persona non grata the Iraqi Ambassador Hikmat Sulaiman and other consular staff. In a letter to U.S. President Nixon on 14 February, Bhutto blamed India and Afghanistan, along with Iraq and the Soviet Union, for involvement in a \"conspiracy ... [with] subversive and irredentist elements which seek to disrupt Pakistan's integrity.\"\nIsrael\n\nAccording to author Mark Perry, CIA memos revealed that in 2007 and 2008 Israeli agents posed as American spies and recruited Pakistani citizens to work for Jundallah (BLA affiliate) and carried out false flag operations against Iran.\n\nThe Baloch Society of North America (BSO-NA) was a Baloch lobbying group founded in 2004 in Washington, D.C. by Dr. Wahid Baloch, a graduate of Bolan Medical College who had gone into self-imposed exile in the United States in 1992. Between 2004 and 2014, his group had been trying to gain American (as well as Israeli) support for the independence of Balochistan. He held meetings with several American Congressmen and allegedly had meetings with several CIA officials. Dr. Baloch had long claimed that the Pakistani government was committing acts of genocide against the Baloch people, and that Islamabad's aim was to plunder the province's vast mineral resources. In January 2014 he released a letter appealing to the United States and Israel for direct assistance in preventing an alleged \"killing spree of Baloch people\" by the \"Pakistani army\".\n\nIn May 2014, Dr. Baloch disbanded the BSO-NA, claiming that the War of Independence of Balochistan was actually a \"war of independence of Khans, Nawabs and Sardars\". He has since formed the Baloch Council of North America (BCN), which has dedicated itself to working with all democratic and nationalist forces in Pakistan to secure Baloch rights through democratic, nonviolent means, within the federation of Pakistan.\nSoviet Union\n\nPakistani scholar Syed F. Hasnat alleged that during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War (1979\u20131989), the Soviet Union helped establish the Balochistan Liberation Army which chiefly operates from southern Afghanistan.\nUnited States\n\nThe US State Department's official policy rejects secessionist forces in the Pakistani part of Balochistan, in support of the country's \"unity and territorial integrity\". The US has, however, expressed concerns over human rights issues and urged parties in Pakistan to \"work out their differences peaceably and through a valid political process.\" In February 2010 a Jundullah leader captured by Iran, Abdulmalek Rigi, alleged on Iranian TV \"that the US had promised to provide\" Jundullah \"with military equipment and a base in Afghanistan, near the Iranian border\" for its fight against Iran. Rigi did not mention assistance in fighting Pakistan (which Iran accuses of backing the Jundullah, according to the BBC).

It is one of six communities on the peninsula that are situated on or near an eruptive fissure.\nOctober 2023 earthquakes\n\nAn earthquake swarm began on the evening of 24 October due to the magmatic intrusion, with the intensity of the earthquakes decreasing by 30 October. Approximately 8,000 earthquakes were detected; most of these tremors occurred at a depth of 2\u20134 km (1.2\u20132.5 mi). The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) reported that the swarm was focused around Eldv\u00f6rp\u2013Svartsengi, north of Grindav\u00edk.

By this time, over 22,000 earthquakes had been recorded since the beginning of the swarm in October. The IMO predicted that an eruption was likely, stating that \"it will take several days (rather than hours) for magma to reach the surface.\" The greatest extent of the magma intrusion was inferred to be around the Sundhn\u00fakur crater chain, approximately 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) north of Grindav\u00edk. Instruments detected the presence of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere on 14 November, indicating that magma was only a few hundred metres under the surface. Although the number of earthquakes decreased somewhat since 10 November, the IMO was still recording between 700 and 1,000 earthquakes daily by 14 November.\n\nGround deformation sensors at Festarfjall [\u02c8f\u025bstar\u02ccfjatl\u0325] and Svartsengi recorded that the ground had moved apart by 120 cm (47 in).

The creation of this graben-like formation has enabled scientists to estimate the volume of the magmatic intrusion as approximately 70 million cubic metres (2.5 billion cubic feet). It is estimated that the subsidence has been continuing at a rate of about four centimetres (1.6 inches) a day. A large crack opened up through the town, which old maps indicate is a reactivation of an existing fault. Scientists at the University of Iceland believe that the fault was created by the last Sundhn\u00fakur eruption over 2,000 years ago.\n\nSensors emplaced in a borehole in Svartsengi detected the presence of sulfur dioxide on 16 November, a classic signature of magma close to the surface."]}, {"query": "Which Baloch leader led a guerrilla war against Pakistan from 1963 to 1969, with the goal of forcing Pakistan to share revenue generated from the Sui gas fields with the tribal leaders?", "response": "Khair Bakhsh Marri", "contexts": ["In 1973, citing treason, President Bhutto dismissed the provincial governments of Balochistan and NWFP and imposed martial law in those areas, which led to armed insurgency.

In 2005, the Baluch political leaders Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti and Mir Balach Marri presented a 15-point agenda to the Pakistan government. Their stated demands included greater control of the province's resources and a moratorium on the construction of military bases. On 15 December 2005 the inspector general of the Frontier Corps, Major General Shujaat Zamir Dar, and his deputy Brigadier Salim Nawaz (the current IGFC) were wounded after shots were fired at their helicopter in Balochistan Province.

Five days later, on 8 April, their bullet-riddled bodies were found in a commercial area. The BLA claimed Pakistani forces were behind the killings, though international experts have deemed it odd that the Pakistani forces would be careless enough to allow the bodies to be found so easily and \"light Balochistan on fire\" (Herald) if they were truly responsible. The discovery of the bodies sparked rioting and weeks of strikes, demonstrations, and civil resistance in cities and towns around Balochistan.\n\nOn 12 August 2009, Khan of Kalat Mir Suleiman Dawood declared himself ruler of Balochistan and formally announced a Council for Independent Balochistan.

Rich in natural resources, this is the largest, least populated and least developed province in Pakistan and Iran, and armed groups demand greater control of the province's natural resources and political autonomy. Baloch separatists have attacked civilians from other ethnicities throughout the province. In the 2010s, attacks against the Shia community by sectarian groups\u2014though not always directly related to the political struggle\u2014have risen, contributing to tensions in Balochistan. In Pakistan, the ethnic separatist insurgency is low-scale but ongoing mainly in southern Balochistan, as well as sectarian and religiously motivated militancy concentrated mainly in northern and central Balochistan.\n\nIn Pakistan's Balochistan province, insurgencies by Baloch nationalists have been fought in 1948, 1958\u201359, 1962\u201363 and 1973\u20131977, with an ongoing low-level insurgency beginning in 2003. This insurgency has begun to weaken. In an article titled \"The End of Pakistan's Baloch Insurgency?\", Baloch analyst Malik Siraj Akbar reported that Baloch militants had begun killing their own commanders. Furthermore, separatists in recent times have also accused their own groups of being involved in wide spread crime, robbery and rapes against Baloch women, with some claiming that what started as an idealistic political fight for their people's rights has turned into gangs extorting, kidnapping and even raping locals. However, Akbar called anger towards provincial Chief Minister Abdul Malik Baloch \"growing and often uncontrollable\". Baloch militants have taken some reconciliation offers from the government and offered to hand in their weapons. In April 2016, four militant commanders and 144 militants had surrendered under reconciliation. 600 rebels were killed and 1,025 surrendered after accepting reconciliation as of August 2016. In April 2017, another 500 Baloch rebels surrendered to the state, including members of BRA, UBA, and LeB.\n\nBaloch separatists argue they are economically marginalised and poor compared to the rest of Pakistan. The Balochistan Liberation Army, designated as a terrorist organisation by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States, is the most widely known Baloch separatist group. Since 2000 it has conducted numerous deadly attacks on Pakistani military troops, police, journalists, civilians and education institutions. Other separatist groups include Lashkar-e-Balochistan and the Balochistan Liberation United Front (BLUF).\n\nHuman rights activists have accused nationalist militants, Government of Pakistan and Iran of human rights abuses in its suppression of the insurgency.\n\nThe News International reported in 2012 that a Gallup survey conducted for DFID revealed that the most of the Balochistan province does not support independence from Pakistan, with only 37% of ethnic Baloch and 12% of Pashtuns in Balochistan favoring independence. However, 67% of Balochistan's population favored greater provincial autonomy, including 79% of ethnic Baloch and 53% of Pashtuns in the province.\nArea of dispute\n\nHistorical Balochistan covers the southern part of the Iranian Sistan and Baluchestan Province in the west, the Pakistani province of Balochistan in the east, and, in the northwest, part of Afghanistan's Helmand Province. The Gulf of Oman forms its southern border. Mountains and desert make up much of the region's terrain. A majority of Baloch inhabit the region of Balochistan that predominantly falls within Pakistan's borders.\n\nGeographically, Balochistan is the largest province of Pakistan (comprising 44% of the country's total area), but it is the least developed and least inhabited, comprising only 5% of the total population.

He said the issue of missing persons had become a chronic problem and, therefore, the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, constituted on the orders of the apex court, should be made permanent.\nEffect of and remedies for the insurgency\nDevelopment issues\n\nThe government of Pakistan has repeatedly stated its intention to bring industrialisation to Balochistan, and continues to claim that progress has been made by way of the \"Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan\" package of political and economic reforms issued in 2009. This is challenged by Baloch nationalist groups, who argue the benefits of these policies have not accrued to native Baloch residents of the province.[citation needed] Baloch nationalist groups continue to highlight the extraction of natural resources, especially natural gas, from the province, without discernible economic benefit to the Baloch people.[citation needed] Nonetheless, the government of Pakistan continues to insist that industrial zones are planned along the new Gawadar-Karachi highway. According to the government, this development is envisaged to bring accelerated progress in the future for the Baloch.[citation needed]\n\nIn February 2006 three Chinese engineers assisting in the construction of a local cement factory were shot and killed in an attack on their automobile, while another 11 injured in a car bomb attack by BLA.[citation needed] China recalled its engineers working on the project in Balochistan.[citation needed] The progress in the hydro-power sector has been slow since then.\n\nThe people of the region have largely maintained a nomadic lifestyle marked by poverty and illiteracy.

Hospitals around Gaza also warned they would soon lose power completely, which would lead to the death of 140 premature babies in NICUs. The Gaza Health Ministry said that more than 192 medical staffers had been killed by Israeli airstrikes, as well as ambulances, health institutions, its headquarters, the Rimal Clinic, and the International Eye Center. The M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said it had counted 18 ambulances destroyed and eight medical facilities destroyed or damaged. On 24 October, a Health Ministry spokesman announced the healthcare system had \"totally collapsed\".\n\nOn 16 October, doctors warned of disease outbreaks due to hospital overcrowding and unburied bodies. The World Health Organization stated the situation was \"spiralling out of control\". The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that it had lost contact with its headquarters on 27 October, disrupting Gazans' ability to contact emergency services.\n\nOn 14 November, Reuters reported that Israel was coordinating the transfer of medical incubators to Al-Shifa Hospital to assist in the evacuation of newborn babies and that the IDF stated that three battery powered incubators were on standby outside Gaza. The director of Al-Shifa stated Israel's statement about providing incubators to premature babies was false.\nGazan malnourishment\nMain article: Gaza Strip famine\n\nAccording to the World Food Program, as of 9 December more than half of the population of Gaza was \"starving\" and more than nine in ten were not eating everyday and 48% suffering from \"extreme hunger\". One of the few bakeries that had still been standing in the Gaza Strip was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah overnight, and Gazans were reported to be searching through the rubble of bombed bakeries attempting to find bags of flour. The United Nations has warned that a collapse of social order could result from the intense hunger among Palestinians. The Associated Press reported that rare instances of public dissent against Hamas were taking place, with reports of angry chants against Hamas by hundreds of people taking refuge in a UN shelter.\n\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki, who is part of the Palestinian Authority, said Israel was using starvation as a weapon, saying \"they are starving because of Israel's deliberate use of starvation as a weapon of war against the people it occupied.\" An Israeli official responded that the charge was \"blood-libellous\" and \"delusional\". Human Rights Watch similarly found that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war by deliberately denying access to food and water. On 16 January 2024, UN experts accused Israel of \"destroying Gaza's food system and using food as a weapon against the Palestinian people\".\nScale of destruction\n\nThe scale, extent, and pace of destruction of buildings in the Gaza Strip ranks among the most severe in modern history. The 29,000 munitions -shells and bombs- Israel has dropped on Gaza in 3 months greatly exceed those (3,678) dropped by the United States between 2004 and 2010 during its Invasion of Iraq. Nearly 70% of homes in Gaza and roughly half of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. As of January 2024, Israel's offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70\u201380% of all buildings in northern Gaza. The damage to buildings in northern Gaza reportedly exceeds that in Bakhmut and Mariupol in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Aleppo in the Battle of Aleppo, and Mosul and Raqqa in the War against the Islamic State; by 5 December 2023, the percentage of buildings damaged or destroyed in Gaza exceeded Dresden and Cologne during World War II and approached the level of destruction seen in Hamburg. Bombing has destroyed or damaged apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, religious sites, factories, and shopping centers. The Guardian reported that the scale of destruction has led international legal experts to raise the concept of domicide, which it describes as \"the mass destruction of dwellings to make  territory uninhabitable.\" By 30 January 2024, satellite image analysis found Israel had destroyed 50-61% of the buildings in Gaza since the start of the war.\n\nDefinitively assessing the extent of destruction in Gaza has been complicated by difficulties in accessing up-to-date satellite imagery. An analysis by The Washington Post found \"apparent craters within 180 meters of 17 of the 28 hospitals in northern Gaza\", although this represents \"a conservative undercount of the actual bombs dropped near Gaza's hospitals\". This analysis focused on bombs weighing 2,000 pounds or more, which could irreparably damage a building 180 meters away.", "The IDF released what it stated was an intercepted call between Hamas operatives and the head of the Indonesia Hospital, where they discuss diverting some of the hospital's fuel supply to Hamas.\n\nTwo days later, the Gaza health ministry stated that Israel struck an ambulance convoy directly in front of Al-Shifa Hospital, killing at least 15 people and injuring 60 more. The IDF acknowledged having launched an airstrike at \"an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone\", adding that a \"number of Hamas terrorist operatives were killed in the strike\". The IDF did not provide evidence that the ambulances were being used by Hamas combatants but said that additional information would be released. A Hamas official described the Israeli statement as \"baseless\". The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said one of its ambulances was struck \"by a missile fired by the Israeli forces\" about two metres from the entrance to al-Shifa hospital. The PRCS said another ambulance was fired on about a kilometre from the hospital. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X that he was \"utterly shocked by reports of attacks on ambulances evacuating patients\", adding that patients, health workers and medical facilities must always be protected.\n\nOn 4 November a UNRWA spokeswoman confirmed reports that Israel had conducted an airstrike against a UN-run school in the Jabalia refugee camp. According to the Gaza health ministry, the attack killed 15 and wounded dozens more.\n\nAbu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, reported that due to Israeli air strikes, the bodies of 23 missing Israeli hostages were buried under the rubble.\nExternal videos\nInstagram videos by Ahmed Hijazi of the Al-Shifa Hospital strike shown in the Visual Investigations report published by The New York Times.

On 22 November, Israel and Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire agreement, providing for a four-day \"pause\" or \"lull\" in hostilities, to allow for the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza. The deal also provided for the release of approximately 150 Palestinian women and children incarcerated by Israel. The agreement was approved by the Israeli cabinet in the early hours of the day; in a statement, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office stated Israel's intention to continue the war.\nDuration of the truce (24 November \u2013 1 December)\nMain article: 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas ceasefire\n\nFollowing the introduction of a Qatari-brokered truce on 24 November, starting at 7:00 am Israel time, active fighting in the Gaza Strip ceased and some of the Israeli and foreign hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel. The truce was announced for a period of four days, but was extended for a longer period.\n\nFrom 24 to 30 November, Hamas released hostages and Israel released prisoners. On 27 November, Qatar announced that an agreement between Israel and Hamas to extend the truce by two days had been reached. Both Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the truce on 28 November. On 30 November, Hamas released two more hostages as the truce, which was supposed to end minutes later, was extended by another day.\nResumption of hostilities (1 December 2023\u2013present)\nIsraeli Merkava tank in a Gaza street, 4 January 2024\n\nThe truce expired in the morning on 1 December, as both Israel and Hamas blamed the other side for failing to agree on an extension. According to the New York Times, the disagreement centered on \"how to define soldiers versus civilians and how many Palestinian prisoners Israel would release for its hostages\". A Hamas official said that after the exchange, the only remaining hostages were \"soldiers and civilian men who served in the occupation army\", and refused to exchange them until \"all our prisoners are freed and a ceasefire takes hold\". US National Security Advisor John Kirby said that \"Hamas agreed to allow the Red Cross access to these hostages while the pause was in place,\" which did not \"happen and is still not happening\".\n\nIsrael adopted a grid system to order precise evacuations within Gaza, released a map online, and dropped leaflets with a QR code for the link. The maps were criticized for being hard to access due to the lack of electricity and internet connectivity, and for causing confusion or panic."]}, {"query": "Which former presidents of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Chile have expressed their condolences following the death of former Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era?", "response": "\nArgentina: None\nBolivia: President Luis Arce\nBrazil: President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, former presidents Michel Temer, and Jair Bolsonaro\nChile: Former presidents Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, and Mauricio Macri", "contexts": ["Former presidents Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, and Mauricio Macri also expressed their condolences.\n     Bolivia: President Luis Arce extended condolences to Pi\u00f1era's family and the Chilean people.

He added that, viewed from Gaza, things were only going to get worse, considering that Netanyahu's coalition partners opposed a two-state solution for the conflict.

China's actions were described as a de facto sanction.\nMedia coverage\nMain article: Media coverage of the Israel\u2013Hamas war\nCriticism from journalists\n\nOver 750 journalists signed an open letter condemning \"Israel's killing of reporters in Gaza and criticizing Western media's coverage of the war.\" The letter said newsrooms are \"accountable for dehumanizing rhetoric that has served to justify ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.\" Signers of the letter were criticized for potentially impeding their organizations' ability to gather news, and could face management backlash, Semafor reported that Los Angeles Times journalists who signed the letter were barred from covering the Gaza war \"in any way\" for at least three months.\n\nOn 13 November 11 international news organizations sent a letter to Israel and Egypt, asking for access to the Gaza Strip to cover the war.\n\nCBS reported on 14 December a statement of the International Federation of Journalists noting that \"the number of journalists killed in the past two months in the war in Gaza has surpassed the amount killed in the Vietnam War, which lasted two decades\". More than 50 Palestinian journalists lost their lives. Various dangerous facts such as airstrikes, but also starvation due to lack of food, risks linking for having no clean water available and shelter made that \"Palestine is one of the most dangerous places for a journalist to do their job\". Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court, under section 8.2.b of the Rome Statute accusing Israel of committing war crimes against 8 journalists. It also lodged a complaint against Hamas, under section 8.2.a of the Rome Statute for the killing of a reporter covering the 7 October attack.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has accused Israel of targeting journalists reporting from Gaza and their families, saying that in at least two cases, \"journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed.\"\nEmbedded journalists with Israel\n\nForeign media such as CNN, ABC, NBC, The New York Times, and Fox News, have limited access to Gaza only in the presence of Israeli soldiers.

Hamas committed to upholding international law, transferring control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Mahmoud Abbas subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States. Soon after the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis exploded, the Al-Qassam Brigades started planning the operation which would break out on 7 October 2023.\nHamas motivations\nFurther information: Governance of the Gaza Strip\n\nHamas officials said shortly following the attack that it was a response to the Israeli occupation, blockade of the Gaza Strip, Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians.\n\nMohammad Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, said in a recorded message on 7 October that it was in response to what he called the \"desecration\" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and Israel killing and wounding hundreds of Palestinians in 2023. He called on Palestinians and Arab Israelis to \"expel the occupiers and demolish the walls.\" Deif also called on \"Muslims everywhere to launch an attack\" against Israel and to urged supporters to \"kill them [the enemy] wherever you may find them.\" He continued, \"in light of the continuing crimes against our people, in light of the orgy of occupation and its denial of international laws and resolutions, and in light of American and western support, we've decided to put an end to all this, so that the enemy understands that he can no longer revel without being held to account.\"\n\nMany scholars state that Hamas's objective is the establishment of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, though Hamas has repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel. In 2017, Hamas replaced its old charter with a new one that removed antisemitic language and stated that its struggle was with Zionists, not Jews. However, the new charter also mentions Hamas will accept the peace agreements only provisionally and will not relinquish its stated goal of forcefully replacing the state of Israel in the entirety of \"historic Palestine\". The attack was also seen as a resolution of internal tensions within Hamas as to whether the group's main goal is governing the Gaza Strip or fighting against Israel.\n\nThe disruption of Israel-Arab diplomacy and the desire to assert its presence as a significant security and political force are considered as likely motives by experts as well.\n\nOn 21 January 2024, Hamas released an 18-page English-language document reiterating its previously stated rationales and framing the attack in a wider context as a struggle against colonialism, describing its actions as \"a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people.\" It said that \"maybe some faults happened\" during the attacks \"due to the rapid collapse of the Israeli security and military system, and the chaos caused along the border areas with Gaza\" and that \"[if] there was any case of targeting civilians it happened accidentally.\" The timing of the release raised questions; sources in Gaza, including those aligned with Hamas, told Haaretz that the document was designed to contend with criticism of the heavy price Gazans have paid for the attacks on Israel.\nIsraeli policy\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has been Israel's prime minister for most of the two decades preceding the war, with the exception of the period from June 2021 to January 2023 when Naftali Bennett and later Yair Lapid took office. Both governments have been criticized for having championed a policy of empowering the Hamas government in Gaza by, for instance, granting work permits to Gazan residents, facilitating the transfer of funds to Hamas and maintaining relative calm. By the conclusion of Netanyahu's fifth government in 2021, the issuance of work permits to Gazans reached approximately 2,000-3,000; however, under the Bennett-Lapid government, this number significantly increased to 10,000. More recently, another 8,000 permits have been granted to West Bank residents under Israel's Unity Government for agricultural work, despite concerns about their vetting and potential security risks. In total, Israel has allowed up to 18,000 Palestinian laborers from Gaza to work in Israel over recent years."]}]
