 In total, I shot 18 deer and wild boars this year.
 For this I have a Every second female deer that you shoot is for free.
 And you also get every wild boar that weighs less than 30 kilos for free.
 Insects for birds, for reptiles, for the whole variety, small critters, which are much more important than deer and deer.
 For them it is catastrophic.
 But for the large plant eaters, our form of turbo agriculture is the slug land.
 They are very, very hostile to strangers on the outside and on the inside they are not at all the aggressive alpha animal that bites everyone else through the gnawing and so on, like in Shackle.
 They are actually quite relaxed in the wolf's den, quite smug, quite loving with each other.
 Also caring, all of these are exemplary characteristics that wolves have.
 But on the outside they are completely humorless, when it comes to strangers.
 Even if it would be legal to shoot wolves at some point,
 what would that mean for the image of hunting,
 if hunters with a proud, chiseled chest would present dead wolves?
 I mean, they are already making fun of themselves now,
 when they still think of the big

 I was long in the world, before that I was very long in the Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung.
 Political journalist, then cultural journalist.
 And in the last years more and more, how should I call it, natural journalist.
 Or a journalist who deals with nature policy, who deals not only with nature protection policy,
 but also with the question of how our images of nature have changed,
 how this then also radiates in political and cultural areas.
 And you can see that these questions,
 what is nature for us, what do we understand from it,
 how do we define our relationship with nature
 or our position in nature,
 these are questions that very quickly lead to quite intense controversies
 in society.
 So there are a lot of opposites that usually slumber under the surface,
 that do not break up, because it is also a complicated matter,
 a very complicated topic.
 But sometimes they break up,
 with major issues of environmental protection or with spectacular species, like the wolf,
 with controversial forms of natural use, like hunting and other things, these topics break down.
 But these are not side issues, these are not any side scenes, but if you deal with the topics,
 then you notice that it is about very, very elementary questions of our self-image and our self-understanding.
 We want to talk about most of them today.
 Yes, gladly.
 But how did you get to thatkeys, chickens, ducks, rabbits,
 zebras, all kinds of animals, dogs.
 And when I went to study, I studied history and sociology in Freiburg,
 then the first course was that I bought a gold hamster, or a guinea pig, no, it was a gold hamster, so that I could have an animal
 in my cabin. Then I have been very far away from these animal questions for a while,
 so until I was 15, 16, until puberty, I was always wondering whether I would rather be a zoo director or a forester.
 Would I rather deal with exotic animals
 or would I deal more with deer, deer, wild boars and whatever is in front of the house.
 But then it was gone at some point.
 I was too young to be a 68-year-old,
 but you could still see the exposure in the early 70s,
 of course, you still noticed in school, there are simply questions of politics and so on
 put forward and that's why the decision was then for the degree in history and sociology.
 And then I worked at the university for a few for a few years and then entered journalism at the Frankfurt General newspaper as a political editor.
 And that's where I dealt with German internal politics.
 I was then mainly almost every federal party day anyway, but also for many state party days.
 I sat down, wrote and commented and wrote reports and so on and so forth.
 That was nice times back then, right? As a SPD reporter?
 Yes, there was still so much hope in the party. So that was the figures, Bj√∂rn Engholm for example, Johannes Rau, Oskar Lafontaine, of course, also back then, Scharping, this group was that.
 Besides that, I also dealt with animal and natural topics more than a stag with animal and natural topics. Those were the non-occupied topics.
 Who can write something if there is an argument about the hunting law?
 What is it about?
 And I knew a little bit about that.
 I soon did the hunter test, because that was still a task I had not yet completed,
 that I wanted to task that I didn't finish yet, that I wanted to do. And when I was professionally settled and had some air,
 I took a course and did the hunting test and then it really started.
 So I was the specialist for all these questions in the editorial office
 and I then looked for the topics and well, well.
 Are there so many or what? What do you mean by many for the topics. Are there so many?
 What do you mean by many? Many topics.
 I wanted to know how many topics there are in terms of hunters or hunting.
 Well, the topic of hunting is an emotional and exciting topic and has a certain journalistic appeal, especially at the weekend.
 Then you can tickle and provoke people a bit or something like that. In some respects, this is a very dry matter, but in connection with the question of the federalism reform, it was Hunting Act, and the countries filled it out.
 But then the federalism reform came to the conclusion that the countries have the say in the legal form of hunting and the Federal Hunting Act loses more and more importance. lose meaning. And these are questions that not only interest experts,
 but the subject of hunting is not so unimportant in the overall
 resource, let's say agriculture and forestry.
 So especially in relation to the forestry is not so unimportant. Especially in relation to the forestry. The question is how to hunt, according to which rules, who hunts and who has control over it.
 Not so unimportant. You have already asked the questions yourself. How do you answer them?
 Can't everyone just grab a rifle and shoot a wild boar? Why do you have to have rules for that?
 No, of course there have to be rules because the hunt has to do with the use of firearms.
 The arrow and bow is already practiced in Brandenburg, right?
 No, it is not yet practiced. This is a highly limited attempt to two communities and to a few people,
 which has not even started yet, because it has not been clarified yet,
 who should actually do all the scientific monitoring of this experiment.
 So that was the, it was about the special question, can wild boars,
 who have become a plague in the inhabited they live in, with arrows and bows,
 more harmless for the fellow human beings,
 for the inhabitants,
 than with the rifle.
 And that should be tried.
 Then it will be about what happened afterwards.
 Secondly, the goals have been achieved,
 to kill enough wild boars.
 My assumption is that the whole thing will fail in the latter part.
 It will not lead to the wild boar population in the area south of Berlin,
 Starnsdorf and Kleinmachnow, that it will be significantly reduced.
 Over the years, the mistake has been made
 that you have hunted too little intensively.
 The hunting herders were obviously happy
 that they had their pigs and that they appeared regularly
 in front of the high seat.
 Instead of really shooting every dead one that came,
 you say, you'd rather leave some left over.
 Next year you want to shoot wild boars again next year.
 And that's the wrong attitude with black wild boars.
 And now this topic of African pig plague is added.
 It would be a catastrophe for agriculture if this were to break out.
 And then there are pretty harsh statements from the political side,
 i.e. from the state, from the veterinary authorities, that the wild boar stock must be diluted with all means possible.
 I think that's completely right, but I don't think bow hunting is the right tool for that.
 Most hunters use firearms. Yes, most hunters use firearms.
 That is very strictly regulated in Germany,
 in terms of acquisition and possession.
 Then the hunt must also be regulated,
 because we have to deal with a strange situation
 for some outsiders.
 We have a highly intensive agriculture that brings in
 tons of fertilizers and nutrients into the entire biosphere year after year
 and leads to a plant growth of protein-rich plants almost all year round.
 So even in winter there are fruit on the fields that can serve as food.
 And this intensive farming lays the foundation for wild livestock stocks,
 the hunters say sheep, as we have never had them in history.
 So we have as many deer, wild boars, red deer, female deer as never before. And that is a consequence of
 intensive farming. So we have them because of this intensive farming and not
 despite the intensity. But why? Can you explain that? No, that simply comes down to the way we do farming,
 providing these animals, these species of animals, large plant eaters,
 with an excess of food throughout the year.
 And secondly, the ever-growing swathes, the ever-growing fields of agriculture,
 of monocultures, are also resting zone for the wild over many months.
 So they have a profit in every respect from this form of agriculture,
 which is catastrophic for most species.
 For insects, for birds, for reptiles, for lures,
 for all the diverse small critters, which are much more important than deer and deer.
 For them it is catastrophic, but for the large plant eaters our form of turbo agriculture is the slug land.
 And that's why we have so many. But that of course leads to conflicts.
 This leads to conflicts with the users, i.e. with the farmers, because the damage goes up if it is not hunted.
 But it also leads to ecological damage.
 These are mainly noticeable in the forest.
 So even in the forest, due to precipitation and water, these nutrients come in.
 The forest vegetation also changes.
 The wild density also increases.
 If we now politically agree,
 as it is written in the forest laws,
 that our forests should be converted
 into more climate-stable mixed forests,
 that is, turn monocultures into more climate-stable mix forests.
 And so that the forests do it themselves, as far as possible.
 That means, not through artificial planting, not through fences,
 not through gutters, behind which the trees are pulled,
 but through natural rejuvenation. So what flies, what the stag leaves behind,
 that should have a chance to grow.
 And it doesn't have a chance if the influence of the biting shell wildlife,
 i.e. the deer and the deer in the forest above all, is too big.
 Then only the plants remain that the animals do not like.
 And these are the ones we don't necessarily want, namely the spruces and the hard keel.
 And the leaves, the wood that is supposed to mix in there,
 that is supposed to come up between the keel and the spruces.
 Ahorns and beavers and eichs and eels and what do I know, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, and the eels, or the biggest damage factors in the forest are too high wildness.
 And that's why they have to be hunted strictly, and much stricter than it is today.
 Because there are still many rules in hunting law that work more as hunting brakes, that come from times when there was less wildness
 and when you had the feeling, or maybe actually the necessity,
 to preserve the wildness from over-hunting and thus to draw borders.
 There were then shooting plans and they were not allowed to be exceeded.
 Today the shooting plans still mean that, but they are minimum shooting plans.
 That means these shooting plans force the hunters to kill a minimum number of animals of the respective species.
 And sanctions can be imposed if this does't happen over a longer period of time.
 Let's talk briefly about the monocultures on the field and in the forest.
 We as humans have a lot of...
 So we are at least guilty of it.
 When did we start with that?
 When did we get off the natural path?
 Yes, we got off the natural path 10,000 or 12,000 years ago, when we gave up our hunter-gatherer existence and switched to agriculture and livestock. But we were still relatively small numbers, so to speak.
 So that's not so important.
 Then came the next big, big change,
 the Industrial Revolution.
 And it has actually changed our relationship,
 let's say since the 18th century,
 our relationship to nature fundamentally.
 The monocultures, if you ask about them, and that has fundamentally changed our relationship to nature.
 The monocultures, if you ask about them, it was already the case that over the centuries of the Middle Ages and the early modern age, from the 12th to the 16th century, the forest area in Germany has gone back and forth because wood was the most important raw material.
 It was the building material, it was the energy supplier,
 it was a wood-making era.
 And the wood was won by simply
 having the forests rooted without having the term sustainability in mind.
 They also rooted the forests to create arable land,oughed the forests to create farmland,
 they ploughed the forests to create settlement land.
 Anyway, this forested Germania that Tacitus described,
 that didn't exist in the Middle Ages for a long time.
 And then the forest went on and on.
 And then at some point a turn came up in the head,
 and that is connected to the industrial revolution.
 This is another interesting paradox.
 When the demand for wood, because of mining and other trade branches,
 was rising again in the course of industrialization. Suddenly, the idea came up that you cannot use raw material wood without limits,
 but that you have to ensure sustainability.
 And then a Saxon state official named Karlo Witz wrote a book about the wood industry and how to treat the forest in such a way that you only get as much out of it as grows back.
 And with that, this concept of sustainability was put into the world and a research was started in Germany. for example for cranes or for buildings, spruces.
 These monocultures were mainly created in the 19th century.
 Then came a large section of forest history,
 the two world wars in the 20th century and above all the Second World War,
 which was then associated with considerable reparations,
 which Germany had to hand over to the victorious powers.
 And there was a repair
 And there was a real compulsion and you have to say it is probably good that it has been re-forested at all.
 But the forests we have now and these spruce poles, where you can look through the forest when you stand down, because, because not much grows in between, between the spruce trunks.
 This kind of forest is also a result of the history of time.
 These are the forests that were founded about 70 years ago.
 I find it interesting that we fell trees to give them to Russia, have but there are an infinite number of trees.
 Yes, but that was...
 Yes, but they probably got them here
 easier, but I don't know exactly what that was.
 But it was also the English
 and the French who got wood from the German forests.
 It wasn't just the Russians, so I don't want to underline the Russians.
 But this repair project I don't want to underline the Russians, but the repair work was part of the whole bundle of repairs.
 Just like the industrial facilities were demolished.
 Is the condition of the forests today better than 20 or 50 years ago?
 Are we on the way up again?
 Or have we not reached the low point yet?
 No, I think that it is no longer going down.
 So much has changed.
 There was another real alarm signal,
 the so-called forest death in the early 80s.
 A huge media topic.
 I think that before the forest,
 except in some sensual phoethons,
 didn't play a big role in journalism.
 But in the early 80s, forest death was a huge topic.
 All major magazines made titles about it.
 It turned out that there was no such thing as forest death.
 But the attention was directed towards the forest.
 And then it turned out that other factors, which were otherwise only discussed within the professional public,
 the forester and hunters, were also problematic.
 For example, the very high wildness levels.
 There was a television program by Horst Stern, who made a series,
 by the way, as a journalist, one of my role models, if you will,
 someone who could really represent politics and nature and nature politics.
 He had a series called Remarks about...
 and then came the pig, the horse, the chicken...
 and then he made a remark about the red deer.
 Remarks about the red deer.
 And that was already the beginning of the 70s.
 And he started with the sentence,
 it is not necessary to protect and hunt the deer,
 it is first and foremost necessary to protect the deer and to hunt it is first and foremost necessary to
 shoot the deer because it appears in numbers and is fed additionally artificially and
 eats up the whole biotope, so to speak, eats up the forest and that is then that
 gave a huge scream then it went a bit uproar, then it went into oblivion again and then when the forest died, the topic came up again ten years later.
 Then it was again about the question, yes, we talked about the sour rain, but it only had bad consequences on a specific basis.
 It was not a surface-covering destruction of the forest.
 It was, it was connected to certain emissions from certain industrial companies, for example at the Czech border.
 But there are other forms of forest death, other causes of forest death.
 For example, the forest death from below. The forest death from below was meant by wildfire.
 And then this topic came to the fore again.
 Can you explain briefly what is so harmful when there is too much wild in the forest?
 When there are wild boars and boars here.
 They significantly prevent the self-renewal of the forest, because they eat away the sprigs.
 They also lead to a mixture of species.
 They prefer certain species, which are then pushed back and they avoid certain species, which get the upper hand, i.e. plant species. These are the two harmful effects that the rotten wild boar has. In addition, the deer, but also the red deer,
 also peel off the bark of trees.
 And that leads to the fact that these trees
 are no longer economically usable.
 So there is more the...
 It is an economic and it is an ecological damage.
 Both are closely related.
 So overgrown wild estates are clearly a... There is a clear conflict of interest Both are closely related. Excessive wild who have to keep the forest profitable in the long term.
 And that doesn't work with high wildness.
 And you have to try to find a balance.
 And this balance was long gone and until a few years ago
 more to the disfavor of the forest and the wild.
 It's just a big...
 ...it's only now that a generation change has taken place, especially in the forest management. where foresters decide and give guidelines and guidelines that think ecologically and economically
 and do not feel primarily as a shepherd or something like that,
 as a shepherd-like forester, as they used to say. But they consider the deer as a pest in the forest and say, well, of course we can't kill it.
 It's also a cultural asset and it also belongs to the forest.
 But in the amount and density that we have it, it doesn't work.
 How was it before? How did nature change? How did it regulate itself so that there were no wild animal stocks?
 Wild animals are a different story. Wild animals are not a big problem in the forest. They are more in agriculture. What do you mean by earlier? Let's go back to the middle of the 19th century.
 We know that there was a European revolution in Europe, the 1848 revolution was a hunting revolution everywhere in Europe, or an anti-hunting revolution.
 That means the farmers and also the civil property owners who lived in the country,
 they rebelled against the hunting privileges of the nobility and the ruling houses.
 Only the rich and the beautiful were allowed to hunt?
 The hunting was forbidden to the farmers.
 Why?
 Because it was a sign of domination. A process took place in the Middle Ages, over several centuries,
 which disqualified the common population from hunting.
 And concentrated all hunting rights with the basic masters.
 And the basic masters were allowed to hunt.
 And the basic masters, as you know, in the court society in the 18th century,
 they organized huge hunting shows.
 The farmers had to do hunting services, they had to do front duty anyway,
 and they had to do hunting services.
 They were often busy for weeks, driving the wild together,
 driving them into large cages.
 And then, in a royal hunting show, the animals were slaughtered over the days.
 And between these hunts, these courtly representation spectacles, the farmers were not allowed to do anything against the deer and wild boars looting their fields.
 That has nothing to do with the fact that they shouldn't have any weapons?
 Yes, that's why they shouldn't have any weapons.
 The farmers were, both in terms of their hunting rights,
 which they once had,
 more suitable than in terms of weapons.
 They were allowed to hunt for a long time, I can't say exactly how long it took, but they were only allowed to carryuggle weapons. And that was to be prevented from the point of view of the rulers.
 We were talking about self-regulation.
 There was a self-regulation in that sense.
 Of course, until the 18th, early 19th century, there were also large predators in Central Europe
 that contributed a little to regulating wild animals.
 But otherwise, it was not regulated much.
 And then in 1848, there was the opportunity for the farmers got the hunting themselves. The National Assembly in the Paulskirche in Frankfurt am Main
 made a decision and immediately put it into effect,
 that all hunting privileges are free of harm
 and that everyone has the right to hunt on their own land had the right to hunt.
 And that meant in the first years after the revolution of 1848 that everyone could actually hunt on their own land.
 And the farmers used that to decimate red-wild and wild boars, black boars, as hunters say, to decimate.
 Then it was turned back again for reasons of public security, as they claimed,
 but also because the pre-existing noble houses and noble families
 did not want to see that the wildness was actually reduced.
 And that's why it was allowed that the wildness had increased again.
 However, not to the extent that it was after the Second World War. There were no such overgrown wild animals in Germany.
 You have to make yourself clear, today a large number of wild animals,
 i.e. wild animals, cattle, deer, wild boars, deer, every year in comparison to the times before 1945,
 when Germany was much larger and hunting dream countries like Pomerania and East Prussia and
 Silesia still belonged. Nevertheless, at that time, maybe, I don't know, I can't
 name exact numbers now, but you can read everything. The hunting result for wild boars in Germany today is 10,000.
 Today it is 100,000.
 I have the number from 2018.
 831,000 wild boars were shot.
 That was the absolute record.
 And also in connection with the pressure of the threatening African swine plague, the hunters really sat down on the ground in the truest sense of the word and did their job.
 But 800,000 wild boars and less than a tenth, certainly, it was in the times before 1945. And 1 million or 1.2 million deer have been constantly in Germany for 20 years, every year.
 And that was less than half before the war.
 So the wild estates are exported, which is also why it has been like that.
 You can't say exactly, I have named one factor, that is intensive farming.
 It's just for the wild, the conditions have improved, there are no longer so conditions have improved for the wild.
 There are not so many people out on the fields anymore.
 It is very quiet outside in the fields,
 apart from tourist or natural sports hotspots.
 In the past, hundreds of thousands of people worked every day on the farm and in the forest.
 And today, every now and then a tractor and in the forest a harvester who plows the trees.
 But not like that, that all the workers, woodworkers are in the forest for weeks and saw and get the tribes out of it. We are slowly approaching the big prey hunters.
 Let's get to the human hunter first.
 You are a hunter yourself.
 What do you have to learn?
 What do you have to learn to hunt?
 You need a license.
 So you have to do a hunter test.
 It's pretty hard in Germany.
 It's of course impossible, but it's a very broad field of knowledge that you have to dig.
 It starts with the biology of not only the huntable animals, but you really learn a lot of things that you would have had to learn in school about birds and about species,
 both of plants and also of animals that we live with.
 Then of course the hunting species, so basically the shell wildlife, but also rabbits and rabbits and the whole other nether wildlife.
 Then the technique, i.e. the handling of firearms.
 A very important topic is the wild predication.
 What do I do when the animal is dead? What do I have to do?
 When do I have to switch on a veterinarian?
 How do I judge?
 What characteristics do I judge?
 Whether an animal is suitable for consumption or not?
 Or do I have to give it to a meat examination first?
 Then all the legal questions, so you have a weapon with you, what does that mean for the topic of emergency and emergency aid?
 What do I have to do when I buy a weapon? How do I have to register them? In what deadlines does this have to happen?
 All these things.
 Then I learn something or must learn something about the handling of hunting dogs,
 about the training of hunting dogs.
 So it's a lot of stuff.
 And then it is asked in writing and in oral and practical terms at the exam.
 And then you get a certificate, you have the hunter's examination.
 And with this certificate of the existing hunter's examination,
 there are only existing and non-existing,
 with this certificate of the existing hunter's examination,
 you then go to the lower hunting authority.
 It is available in every district and in every city without a district.
 And it is applying for a hunting license.
 To do this, you have to submit this hunting test certificate, a police leadership certificate and the proof that you have completed a criminal termination for the hunt. And if all of this is in place and if you don't have any pre-punishments in the criminal record,
 so somehow because of wildness or something like that, or because of unauthorized possession of weapons or any of those things,
 then you get a hunting certificate which lasts up to three years.
 But with this hunting license I can't go out into the forest and hunt.
 That would have been my question. Can you go anywhere with your gun and look, ah, come on, then you're here.
 No, with the hunting license I can go into the weapon shop and buy a rifle and ammunition. But then I have to go to the weapon authority within 14 days
 and have them entered into a weapon possession card that is then issued to me.
 Otherwise I can't hunt with the hunting badge,
 but when I have bought a rifle, then I have different options. Then I can, for example, go to the next forestry office
 and say I would like to shoot a deer at Christmas and would like to apply for a single shot of a deer.
 And then they usually get a hunting permit from a regional forester for a week or 14 days or longer.
 And then it says what they are allowed to do.
 So they bought a kind of single shot, the permit for the single shot in a forest, in a public forest, in a national forest.
 You can choose what kind of animal you shoot.
 You have to say what you want to shoot.
 But can you tell the forester that you want the biggest deer, the most beautiful deer?
 No, no. The biggest deer and the most beautiful deer are relatively expensive and is not suitable for Christmas roasts.
 I would only advise against shooting big and fat deers, that does not help at all.
 But if you want to have a Christmas roast, you have to shoot a deerskin or a deer-kid or a freshling with the wild boars.
 So young animals are better in the pan than old animals, that's logical.
 Why is that logical?
 Because they are much more tender
 and they have better meat than
 some old animals that have
 a long life behind them.
 They get tough easily.
 But young ones
 have better meat.
 Then I have the
 possibility
 to have a permanent hunting opportunity for me, even in public forestry, i.e. in forest management, by getting a permit that lasts a year. financially not particularly expensive. And then it is usually the case that you can hunt all the huntable species there,
 but you have to provide a minimum shot for certain species.
 So you have to shoot at least two deer.
 Because we do, from the perspective of the forester, this is a job that has to be done.
 They have to be shot anyway.
 And if there are hunters who are so crazy, I'll say in quotation marks,
 to pay for this work, it's good, but they should do the work.
 So two deer as minimum
 and freshlings as much as you want, young wild boars or older wild boars. So two deer as a minimum to shoot a deer in the big capital. That costs a few thousand euros.
 Have you ever shot a deer this year? Not yet, but otherwise everything else.
 I have a business card here in the Forsten in Berlin,
 not far from here, in the Pankow.
 And there is everything ...
 What's going on there?
 There are basically deer and wild boars. And overall, I shot 18 deer and wild boars this year.
 And for that I have a It costs 400 euros a year, but you get every second female deer you shoot for free.
 And you also get every wild boar that weighs less than 30 kilos for free.
 You can then count that against it. I also have two stowaway dogs, which are necessary for the big movement hunts in autumn and winter,
 where the most shooting takes place, where the most wild is shot.
 And for the use of these dogs there is also a compensation.
 And then I get below zero.
 Do you always eat your prey?
 No, I can't eat that much.
 But first of all I have a big family, they all benefit from it.
 And I sell some of it.
 But in the neighborhood and at very low prices. Again to the hunting culture in your book.
 It seems to me, you have not further expressed it,
 as if the German hunting culture differs from other European hunting cultures.
 Can you explain that a little bit?
 Yes, well, the German hunting culture is
 very strongly influenced by the system of the territory that we have to briefly explain now
 unlike other countries, i.e. unlike in roman countries such as france or italy
 or in some areas of switzerland, so to speak Switzerland, hunters are hunted everywhere.
 Hunters have hunting licenses.
 There is not one hunter, one district herder,
 who can exclusively apply hunting law
 in a large area for himself or apply hunting training law. can only claim hunting rights or the right to exercise hunting.
 And in Germany, which is also a consequence of the revolution of 1848,
 the system of the district was created.
 This means that after the general freedom of hunting after the revolution ended, I tried to re-establish it, and I came to the following conclusion.
 Hunting rights remain with the basic owners,
 but basic owners who only have small property
 are forced to join hunting cooperatives. The area of these hunting cooperatives is then divided into a hunting district. to a hunter who then, in the name of all these basic owners,
 practices hunting in this area.
 He pays the hunting partnership a pachtbetrag, a pachtzins,
 and is given the right to acquire the hunting wild that he harvests.
 And then sell it.
 If it is a profitable hunt with a lot of wild,
 then he can or could
 earn the share price or even make a profit from it.
 In other countries, every hunter can hunt everywhere.
 Yes, you can't hunt everywhere.
 The owner can take
 his own property from the hunt, but there are no exclusive hunting pacts like in Germany. Although it was the result of the civil revolution, it was a kind of re-feudalization of hunting, also in the sense of the hunters.
 They then really felt like the half-gods in Lodenkr√∂n in their area and responsible for everything. There are still some. In addition, it is connected with certain rites and hunting cultural customs,
 up to certain legal terms that even appear in the law,
 such as German broad justice, from which nobody knows exactly what it actually is,
 but which, as an indefinite legal term, is instilled in us through the right to hunt is a part of our human rights. And that is something that, as I see it,
 characterizes the German hunt in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, in a very, not intervene limitlessly into the wild and slaughter mass animals,
 has led to him breeding mass very far in the foreground.
 That many hunting species are simply forbidden in Germany, which are allowed in other countries.
 For example hunting with a bow or also the meadow hunting with dogs.
 All of this is forbidden in Germany and it can only be shoot with a rifle and it is also allowed to shoot at larger animals only with bulletproof bags and not with a shotgun like in almost all other European countries. animal protection in the right to hunt, but this German forest justice has the unpleasant
 property that one then removes the necessities of wild resource reduction and says that
 is inhuman, that contradicts German forest justice and that's nonsense.
 If the wolf now belongs to German forest justice, we'll add one last point to hunting.
 You're not a member of the German hunting association, but you're with the ecological hunters.
 Why are there different political views?
 Well, not party-political views, you can't say that.
 You're a left-wing hunter and the others are right-wingers.
 Yes, but they are actually very different in terms of hunting policy.
 Hunting policy is interesting, now it's getting exciting. What I wanted to make clear is that the ecological hunting association does not consider hunting as a self-interest.
 Hunting is a craft that should be mastered as well as possible and in which you should always continue to form. But it is only justified as a natural use of wild products that are not threatened in their stock
 and which have to be hunted for other reasons. That's one thing. We are experts in the production of wild meat, of bio-meat.
 At least from an animal-ethical point of view, meat is something you can eat without any doubt.
 We have never seen it in a stable, we have never seen it in medication, we have never seen it in animal transport, and we have never seen it, they have never seen animal transport, they have never seen a slaughterhouse.
 The second is hunting as an essential service in the context of the country and the forestry industry.
 We reject the trophy hunt, i.e. the trophies as the goal of the hunt and also as a goal of dealing with wildlife.
 That you raise wildlife to have as many trophies as possible
 and to have as much potential as possible.
 We decide that and we also reject the hunt for prey, so for predators, as they used to say, small and large, out of hunting competition.
 So we say it is not a legitimate thing to hunt foxes, because I want to hunt rabbits in autumn and the fox eats too many rabbits.
 We reject that.
 The others don't.
 The others don't, no. They will of course all say that's not the point,
 it's not about the hunting competition, but about the nesting animal
 and the poor nesting animal, it has to be helped.
 And there the prey hunting is unbearable and you have to shoot the cranes. And that is an endless chain of interventions in nature,
 which always with the self-understanding of the hunter,
 be it now who has to create order in nature
 and to ensure balance in nature
 and who is responsible for the equality of all species.
 That's a crazy thing.
 These are things that cannot be influenced by the methods of hunting at all,
 that have nothing to do with hunting and that go in the wrong direction.
 The hunter is not a super regulator at the switchboard of nature.
 There are a few more hens and a few more foxes, but the fox has to go.
 It's complete nonsense.
 On the one hand, we are there to take back our claims as eco-hunter and say, what are we hunting?
 We hunt the shell world, deer, deer, wild boars. That is the essential.
 The other thing is that they are all special cases.
 It can also be that you have to hunt foxes if, for example, the tollbooth should break again.
 Then you have to hunt foxes, but then it's no use to sit on a hill and forcefully kill every fox that comes by.
 You really have to dig out the
 and then decimate the foxes quite rabidly and radically.
 That has nothing to do with hunting and such.
 But that is not necessary at the moment, then you should leave the foxes alone.
 They eat a lot of mice in the forest and do a lot of good with it.
 And yes, so these are the, there are a few differences between an ecological hunting association and traditional hunters. Do you also demand, I mean, we come to the wolves now, you have written a book, a great
 readable, readable book.
 When we are at the hunting associations, your eco hunting association also demands that the wolf
 should finally be shot again.
 If you consume media, then you first hear the, I don't want to say the shepherd,
 but there is a shepherd who has to be killed, who have to kill the Sch√§fer, shoot him down.
 The hunting associations are also often involved.
 I don't get anything from you, but from other associations who say, please take your time.
 Do you want to?
 It's a pity that you haven't heard from us yet.
 We are also a very small association compared to the national hunting association in Brandenburg, for example.
 But we decided to chase the wolf and to take the wolf into hunting law. wolf management when it came to laying down this wolf regulation that
 should regulate the handling of difficult wolves. We worked closely with the sheep breeding association.
 So the sheeps are not all so fiercely against the wolf, they say we are the
 keepers of sheep but not the hunters of wolves. We worked together with the sheep breeding association and tried to find a way
 to ensure the interests of the breeding animal care
 and still give the wolf a right to exist,
 namely where he appears and not in any reserves.
 And for example, in our opinion, with a surface-covering hunting,
 i.e. the wolf as a normal hunting animal, which is then shot at such a drive hunt,
 nothing changes at all.
 You don't change anything about the threat of the herds,
 you don't change anything about the need to the herds. You also don't change anything about the need for the sheeps to exercise herd protection.
 It's no longer possible without herd protection.
 You don't get around the herd protection.
 It doesn't matter if there are three or thirty or three hundred wolves around.
 And we then said, well, there can't no armament competition with the wolves in the herd protection.
 The wolves learn of course. And there are always some who learn to skip or ignore the latest fence why it should be the case that a wolf that...
 You agree on a certain standard for herd protection
 and a wolf that overcomes this standard
 can be shot down for the second time. There is no general release for wolves in certain areas where there are wild animals,
 but certain wolves who learn to overcome herd protection measures should be killed.
 So that they don't teach others.
 Exactly, so that they don't teach others, especially their offspring, people, and so that it doesn't happen over and over again.
 However, this has to happen in a way that cannot be taken into account by the borders of the German system of the district. can't take any consideration. That means that if these wolves,
 who have a large action radius,
 which is much larger than an average hunting area,
 an average hunting area has 500 hectares,
 let's say, in Brandenburg,
 and a wolf territory is 50 times as big. So people, professionals,
 have to be commissioned
 to shoot these wolves,
 who can go beyond the hunting limits,
 who do not have to orient themselves
 to these hunting limits,
 and who are also trained,
 who can do this,
 and who also master the corresponding technical means and methods.
 And that is of course for many hunting herders, for many traditional hunters, that is the ultimate battle announcement.
 Because they say, so foreign armed people in my hunting area,
 that doesn't come into the bag at all. That's not possible.
 That's the moment of the state of affairs.
 I told you our position, that's also the position,
 that's also what's in the regulation in the big and whole in Brandenburg.
 But the resistance against it is of course huge
 and the conflict is
 far from over and the rejecting attitude of the conservative traditional hunting associations
 against the wolf has become more and more severe in recent years. When the wolves appeared here 20 years ago,
 it was more like, well, the wolf wants to come, nice that he shows up again.
 You didn't expect it to spread so quickly.
 But now the hunting associations and the German hunting association have taken a very strong anti-wolf position.
 The subtitle of your book says, how a home-traveller changed our lives.
 Wolf is coming now, why was he home here before?
 Well, sure, he was home here before, until the middle of the 19th century, but there were wolves everywhere.
 In many areas there were wolves in Germany.
 And that ended very quickly after 1850.
 The wolves were systematically hunted.
 They were already systematically hunted before, but the successful success was only given from 1850.
 Because the farmers were also hunting.
 They hunted among other things. The firearms became better and the access to firearms became better.
 So you could fight the wolf more effectively than before.
 And that's why it was in the second half of the 19th century.
 But of course the wolf belongs here,
 as far as the natural environment is concerned,
 as far as the animals that live here are concerned,
 the wolf belongs here.
 And he finds much finds much better living conditions today than it did 200 years ago.
 200 years ago there was less forest, much less wildlife, and there were people who couldn't tolerate the wolf,
 because it was really an existential threat. And today we have masses of wild animals,
 we have much more forest than 200 years ago,
 and we have a population, a society,
 in which the idea is apparently majority-based
 that even large predators have a right to live
 and belong to our nature.
 That would have been different one or two generations ago.
 That's not how it was seen.
 Even nature conservationists had the idea that wolves or other largerabbers disturb nature. But then there was an ecological change,
 also in thinking, a switch was put in place.
 And since then you can see that it is also very good for nature
 when large predators are on the move.
 It promotes the health of the
 wild animal stocks the prey animal stocks and it is already in order that he is there nevertheless
 is the wolf in our human history has a special position and
 I would be interested in why why that is so I mean we don't talk about
 wolves we also talk about you often say the wolf we don't know why that is. When we talk about wolves, we often say the wolf.
 We don't say the pigeon or the wild boar is disturbing us again.
 But we say the wolf.
 It is often called evil.
 You also write about animals.
 You describe scenes where you think,
 is this a witch's burning?
 Or is the wolf hanging up
 and being exposed for weeks in the village?
 Where does this
 special hatred of people
 come from on the wolf?
 Back then.
 We have to understand
 the past first.
 Because if you have the history of mankind,
 the way of seeing the wolf as the incarnation of evil is relatively new.
 We as Homo sapiens appeared in Europe about 40,000 years ago.
 And there was immediately, it other or something like that.
 But above all by finding similarities.
 We have the same ecological niche, we have hunted the same prey animals, we have had similar hunting strategies.
 We found that there is a similar social structure, a family structure.
 And the wolf was very close.
 If there had not been this closeness between humans and wolves in the past, we would not have had dogs.
 The dog is the other side of the wolf.
 You always have to think about that. And that was the first big step, with which people emancipated themselves from nature,
 with which they created a new kind of wolf.
 Everywhere where people live, no matter on which continent, no matter in which culture, everywhere there are dogs.
 So that speaks for itself. And the dog is the successor of the wolf. There are no other species of the dog.
 That surprised me. In your book, we didn't even realize that only in the last decades it became clear to us that in the last decades the wolf was the dog of the wolf.
 Yes, yes, that's...
 If you read Pr√§mies Tierleben, you'll hear about the dogs, but there's no awareness that the wolf is the dog's father-in-law.
 There's a primordial dog that died and you don't know. and even Konrad Lorenz, 50 years ago, had the idea that several wild dog breeds had to be involved in the birth of the dog,
 because the variety of dog breeds is so large that it cannot come from one species.
 He has seen jackals as a stepfather.
 But in the meantime, genetics has eliminated all doubts.
 The wolf is the sole stepfather of the dog.
 That's one thing. For many ten thousand years, the wolf and human were competitors and companions.
 A community of fate.
 A community of fate, yes.
 Why?
 Because they were affected by the same disasters and benefited from the same luck.
 When it came to driving a wild horse herd over a cliff,
 both the wolves and the humans had no worries for many weeks or months.
 There was no wild animal, which was bad for both of them.
 They had to concentrate on each other. Then the wolves probably started to hunt people
 and vice versa, of course, to hunt people and wolves.
 But as I said, it's all in a very distant past
 and you can only speculate about it.
 But as I said, the dog is for me the proof
 that the original relationship between man and wolf was close.
 It was very similar.
 In today's hunting cultures, in the original hunting cultures of the North American Indians,
 the wolf is a creature that is admired and not hated.
 But then came the greatest revolution of human history,
 the so-called Neolithic Revolution, the transition to agriculture and livestock.
 And then it's in the hands.
 If I hunt wild and keep it picture in the right place,
 then the wolf, who appears to be extremely attractive,
 will naturally become an absolute competitor and no longer a companion.
 And from then on it was over with the harmony or this sympathy for each other
 and the wolf became the enemy of the shepherd, above all.
 And that then also wrote itself into cultural overlaps.
 So let's say for 10,000 years
 this story Wolf-Man moves in the frame of interpretation that is still familiar to us.
 Only recently this old thing came up again in the form of wolf-romanticism and something like that. especially urban people, see the wolf as a kind of wilderness god
 or as a kind of peace-bearer of nature.
 There was, I don't know if you know this scene...
 You could say a dozen.
 Oh, sorry.
 You might know the scene from The movie where Kevin Costner is alone on the bench and a wolf appears. and makes it possible for him to take this military base at the edge of civilization as his place.
 So the wolf has in a way, if you will, with his fate, and then leads him to the native Indians who are still in harmony with nature.
 And this idea that the wolves live in harmony with nature and can teach us to be in harmony with nature again,
 of course, plays a big role in the Wolf history in Germany in 2001 or 2003.
 I think it was at Beckmann or in one of the talk shows,
 Gesa Kluth was sitting there. She is a biologist,
 a pioneer of wolf research in Germany and wolf monitoring,
 who has been very busy from the beginning with the wolves in the Saxon Lausitz.
 She was invited to a talk show with Kevin Costner and that was this story.
 So now the wolves are coming back to us and now nature is making us a peace offer.
 It invites us to live more in harmony with nature.
 That the wolves came because we have a farm here that we should rather not have if we are looking for harmony with nature that was not so in consciousness at that time
 I found it very interesting you have spoken about domestication and that we always thought that
 the men did it before but there is also apparently a theory that women
 in quasi back then that was the that was the this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeric Ziemen, who is the great-grandfather of the wolf scene in Germany.
 I personally met a really impressive man, who unfortunately died way too early.
 But he was driven by the question, how did that happen?
 He knew himself, because he worked with hedgehogs, that you can only get used to a wolf if you take it away as a very young wolf from the mother and pull it up with the bottle itself.
 But how should that have happened in the Stone Age?
 Many, many thousand years before goats, sheep or cattle were domesticated.
 So where to take the milk to raise these wolves.
 There was only one source of milk and that was the women.
 And they took the wolves to the breast and these little wolves, probably as really as pet animals,
 so probably not with any strategic thoughts behind it, but the hunters had beaten a wolf, or beaten the mother.
 And then there were the wolves, they brought them with them.
 And even with stone age people the baby scheme works the same way.
 They brought the animals with them and the women cuddled with the wolves and took them into their breasts and pulled them out.
 The condition was that the wolves, which were not yet dogs, were so close to the living area, the home, so to speak, of the human being to the living space, the home.
 You can't imagine it any other way.
 And Dennis Thiem has done many research trips, also ethnological ones,
 and he has observed this phenomenon in different cultures.
 Not only with dogs, but also with young pigs.
 It was about house animals, women who took the breast.
 It's funny that in our human history, I think of Rome,
 that's exactly the opposite of Rome.
 That's the wolf that roemulus and remus suck,
 the founders of the, the capital of the world.
 I see it as a kind of mirror-torn memory of those times.
 After your book, I want to ask you about religions.
 You write about Christianity, Islam, Judaism, these are heretic religions. What does that have to do with the wolf?
 Well, they have in the evening land, but also in the morning land, if it is about Islam, this wolf's enmity is of course significantly sharpened.
 This wolf-enemy is of course also significantly sharpened. In the biblical texts he is the you will, the epitome of order and good, the foreseeing, the guardian.
 The shepherd, the king is the upper shepherd in the peoples of this world region.
 And that's why it's not entirely unimportant that they are herds religions,
 from which our culture is significantly shaped.
 Because the church, for example, later on, the figure of the shepherd is of course further elevated,
 as an institution in charge.
 And the shepherd is nobody else than the one
 who protects the herd against predators, against the evil robbers.
 And the most important evil robber was the wolf.
 And does that have to do with the fact that we humans, when we killed a wolf, celebrated it like a witch's burning?
 So that really had to be something different than when a fox and a deer were killed?
 Yes, that certainly has to do with it, but I think these excesses actually have been expressed in certain times of the late Middle Ages.
 So actually also in the times when there were the embodiment of the devil.
 Is that also the idea of the werewolf?
 I can't tell you exactly.
 She certainly plays along with it, but the idea of the werewolf has no direct Christian roots.
 There will certainly be other, older sources.
 But I can't tell you exactly.
 The wolves we have in Germany, who came here slowly 20 years ago,
 you also wrote in 2000, in La 2000, that the first wolf born in Germany
 could be proven.
 Why were they able to survive in Eastern Europe?
 All these decades.
 Are the Poles, White Russians and Russians cooler
 when it comes to the wolf?
 First of all, they are cooler. You have to say that we have already had this experience.
 We also have neighboring relations with the Poles and exchange
 our views on the relationship with the wolves.
 But that's something different.
 First of all, it's not like they could survive all of Eastern Europe.
 After the Second World War, it was actually the case, the wolves were also pushed back to very few areas,
 namely to densely populated areas in the Biskits, in southern Poland and in eastern Poland.
 And only since the 1980s and 1990s did wolves were considered a kind of minimal protection in Poland.
 Before that, they were the victims that everyone was allowed to kill.
 Then the wolves were taken into hunting and had a time of protection.
 That was at least a progress.
 And then came, and this is connected with very young developments, then came the political turn and then the way of Poland into the European Union
 and then the corresponding nature protection rules came into play,
 which Poland then subjugated.
 And that's why the wolf in Poland is now as protected as it was in our country.
 But it wasn't like that that the wolf in Poland, in the West-Poland or so, would have survived.
 He only came back in the last decades.
 And further east, Belarus, Russia, well, there's is so much room that even if the will was to eradicate the wolves and they were dealt with.
 But such a wolf-slaughtering policy,
 as it was done in the German countries in the 19th century,
 there has never been so much I know in Russia not given when we came up with the idea
 to put the wolf under species protection that was you write it in a book I think a European
 European idea and how long will it be protected so what are the prerequisites for
 it not to be hunted not to be he is, as you described earlier, a problem wolf.
 There were different steps to protect the wolf.
 It never only affected the wolf, but of course also other species.
 But that started in the 1970s with the Perna Convention.
 That was an international agreement
 with which the European Council's members
 had to put certain species and landscapes,
 certain biotopes, if you like, under protection.
 certain biotopes, if you like, to be protected. The wolf was also affected by this, the wolf was explicitly treated as an animal that is under nature protection.
 There was a nature protection law at some point.
 Yes, the nature protection law, the federal nature protection law is now in the form as we have it now the result European Flora-Fauna-Habitat Directive.
 This is the big nature, species and landscape protection regime in the European Union.
 And the members of the European Union implement this European Directive in their national legislation.
 And in Germany it is the federal natural
 protection law that implements this guideline and there the species are led in certain
 categories that each justify such a different status of protection and the wolf
 is listed in the category of species that enjoy the highest protection status. And that means that the wolf is not hunted,
 that is, it is not allowed to be taken by nature,
 it is also not allowed to be captured alive,
 it is not allowed to disturb its caves, its excursions.
 And the respective country is obliged to install a monitoring,
 that is, a precise observation of the development of the population.
 A report must be issued every six years of the European Commission.
 And then it is determined whether the population has developed in the direction of a favorable state of maintenance or whether it has developed in this direction or whether it has developed worse.
 The countries are obliged to work for the population to develop in the direction of a favorable state of maintenance.
 And if this favorable state of maintenance were achieved, then one could think about whether the wolf would then enter another category of protection
 and then possibly also be hunted by rules, and not by wild could be hunted. For example, geese are in a range that also contains protected species,
 but species that can also be controlled.
 And geese are hunted here.
 And in this range, the wolf, if he is in a favorable state of mind.
 And then he could be taken up into hunting law and could get a hunting time.
 So that would be legally possible. The only question is whether it makes sense, whether it affects anything. We don't have so many wolves that the winning of wolf fur is a significant economic value. Germany has a living space of about 440 rodents.
 A rodent consists of 10-12 wolves.
 If we had 4.500 wolves in Germany, then the cheap maintenance condition would be reached.
 Because no rodent is divided into a region.
 The thing with the cheap maintenance condition is of course a ...
 Is it a political or a scientific question? The problem is that it's both.
 If it were only a scientific question, then one would have to talk about the favorable state of mind on the basis of natural settlements of some kind and not on the basis of state borders.
 Since it is a political question, it is also about state borders.
 That means the country, the respective country of the EU, must find whether there is a certain kind of
 in its borders in a favorable in its borders or not.
 However, the countries can work together.
 For example, Germany and Poland.
 That makes sense, because the wolves of West Poland and the German wolves form a population.
 That is undeniable.
 There is also a regular exchange.
 It is nonsense to question whether they are in a favorable position or not,
 to make a certain halt at the state border.
 But at the moment it is actually political and also legally. So this is a partly absurd
 and contradictory situation
 in which we are now.
 If we are talking about the numbers,
 the absolute numbers,
 there is a
 rule of thumb that is repeatedly mentioned.
 There should be
 1000 adult
 individuals. If there were 1000 adult individuals, then you could be 500 rodents.
 We only have room for 440. Well, it could be that they never live in a cheap house.
 But you notice that when you start to juggle these numbers,
 that it gets a bit alber.
 Because that's not how you can look at things.
 But it is to assume that we will have to talk about it at some point,
 because wolves develop quite exemplary, right?
 Yes, wolves develop very well, faster than most expected,
 but they won't develop limitlessly.
 So I would wait until the territories that can be occupied by wolves, or let's say that wolves want to occupy, are occupied.
 That will be the case in a few years, let's say in at least ten years. The current steep rise in population growth has to flatten out.
 Because the wolves don't stack up.
 The wolf density doesn't increase in one area.
 Everything that comes along has to look for new territories.
 It's important to explain this.
 Every rod has its own territory. Every rod has its own territory. In Brandenburg there are about 200 to 300 square kilometers.
 So it is a pretty big territory.
 And these territories are defended by the rod that sits there, also defends. So they don't
 have to be foreign wolves in this territory.
 The territory is marked and young wolves,
 the one-year-old, who wander and search for their own territories,
 take a pretty high risk of being attacked by territorial wolves,
 being injured or even killed.
 So internal killing is not a very unimportant cause of death for the wolves.
 You also write quite nicely that wolves are aggressive on the outside and solidary on the inside.
 And that also resembles us humans as warrior societies. Exactly. They are very hostile to outsiders.
 And inside they are not the aggressive alpha animal that bites everyone else through the gills and so on, like in Shachel.
 They are actually quite relaxed in the wolf's den, quite smug and loving.
 They are caring and have a lot of good qualities.
 But they are not funny when they are outside.
 What happens if Eckart Fuhr wants to shoot a wolf in Brandenburg?
 Would you be taken off the hunting license be taken away?
 Do you go to prison or does it not actually happen?
 So if I do that now, it is of course absolutely illegal
 and it is proven to be a high penalty.
 So I would be free of the hunting license.
 Probably for the rest of my life, I think so.
 You can also find mild judges, you can ask them again in ten years.
 And then there was a high fine of many thousand euros.
 Whether I go to jail right away when I shoot a wolf, I don't know.
 But theoretically it is possible. So theoretically this violation of the right to protect the species is a crime that can be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
 Is that really the case?
 I think that's right. not very few illegal shots of wolves, but not so many that you can say
 there would be a secret wolf breeding on the surface.
 So this punishment, this criminal protection status, it seems to be scary.
 And by the way, I don't want to talk about the fear,
 but you have to say that most hunters are not wild about shooting wolves dead.
 That's not the case.
 They don't just keep their fingers straight because they're afraid of their hunting instinct, but also because they don't find much to shoot wolves.
 You have to imagine, there are at least as many,
 but probably many more people who love and honor wolves
 and decide the same way.
 What kind of unrest is created when a wolf is shot.
 What that will mean for hunting afterwards.
 Even if it would be legal to shoot wolves at some point.
 What would that mean for the image of hunting,
 if hunters with proud, swollen breasts would present dead wolves. I mean, they are already making fun of themselves now,
 when they still think of the big Then Rambo would be Zambor. The strict species protection is probably also valid in Romania.
 There are German websites of hunting providers that explicitly offer wolves to be shot with us to Romania or Bulgaria.
 Costs 1500 euros per wolf and so on.
 That must be absolutely illegal.
 No, that's ...
 Romania belongs to the eu yes romania belongs to the eu and
 has now also the hunt for large prey is also completely forbidden, although what that
 means in practice in romania is a completely different question but you can't go to
 romania today and just shoot a wolf or a bear.
 So they're still throwing something at you?
 Is that still the case? I don't know.
 I'm not so sure.
 You'll show it to me later.
 We don't want to advertise for that shit. I'm not so sure. Other member states of the European Union where wolves can be hunted legally.
 Finland and Sweden have also created such possibilities through exception regulations,
 but they are in question.
 They are being fought on legally, both nationally and at the European Court.
 That is still open, not decided yet.
 I wanted to ask you why Sweden has introduced a border
 and can shoot wolves if there is strict protection of the species.
 Yes, so in Sweden, the special case is that they say
 there is a more equal or higher good,
 and that is the culture and lifestyle of the seeds,
 and that concerns the reindeer herders.
 It concerns the entire northern half of the state area,
 and no wolves should be tolerated there permanently.
 And the seeds can, as soon as a wolf appears and
 roars from their herds, apply for a protection hunt.
 And then these wolves are shot.
 The females can do that themselves, but
 people from the hunting authority also come
 with helicopters and then shoot the wolves off.
 And then there is an area in central Sweden
 where wolves are tolerated,
 these are the 300.
 Some say that's a borderline,
 and others say that's the minimum stock.
 That's what the debate is about in Sweden.
 And if the stock grows beyond this threshold,
 then a license hunt can be held.
 Then hunters can acquire the license for a wolf hunt in a tight time window of 14 days or so in February.
 And then the wolf is released for hunting in this area for 14 days.
 And every hunt must be reported immediately. And there is a hunting guide that is connected to all other hunters by radio and other means.
 And as soon as these five or ten wolves, who are then allowed to be shot, are dead, the hunt is immediately ended.
 Whether this is legal, this is currently being negotiated in front of the European Court and we have to see how it goes.
 In Germany, the hunting associations say that Sweden is the role model and we want to do that too.
 You will see.
 But not your hunting association?
 No, the ecological hunting association doesn't say that.
 The ecological hunting association, we have already heard that, does not want to put the wolf into wolf, and does not even have a license to hunt the wolf.
 We are slowly coming to the end. It's also very good, it's very important about the sheep and the breeding animal.
 We may have to talk about it at some point. But I still have two small formulations that I was very surprised by this formulation. And maybe we could talk about it briefly. You wrote on one page,
 the wolf settles in the intimate sphere of our cultural history.
 What do you mean by the intimate sphere of our cultural history?
 We would have to go back to the context.
 I don't know what I meant by that.
 I only had one sentence for you.
 In the intimate sphere of our cultural history. I can only imagine that it was this first early encounter, which was the decisive step to make us cultural beings, if you will.
 That's what I meant.
 And that we have exterminated the wolf, but that we never let him go.
 On the one hand he lies lying on the sofa with us as a dog
 and on the other hand he spits through our heads whether he is there or not.
 It's just not possible to do anything else.
 That's what I could have meant.
 And then you wrote, the wolf is the guideline of the post-industrial working world
 with flat hierarchies.
 What do you mean by that?
 Yes, that's what coaches and business advisors have discovered.
 There was once a scientific paradigm shift in behavior research when one noticed that the old model of the strict hierarchy of the wolf herd did not work,
 we always only researched in kennels wolves.
 And where the wolves cannot get out of the way, but where they are locked in a relatively narrow space,
 then you find such phenomena of aggressive rank battles. Since the 70s of the previous century, the possibilities of free land observation have improved.
 There were a whole range of, especially American scientists, biologists, who have observed wolves in the free land for a long time,
 at the very top, on Ellesmere Island in the Arctic, over the years and have found that in nature the family life of wolves is quite different.
 So that it is actually not an aggressive hierarchy from top to bottom,
 but that there are of course the lead wolves, There are the wild biological or behavioral biological paradigm shift, which then arrived at some point in the corporate culture
 and offered a whole series of books and seminars and other things.
 So managers go to wolf cages somewhere,
 in the wild you can't plan to meet wolves,
 so go to the wolf center or somewhere else, sit in a wolf's enclosure and learn that it is more effective if you don't box your authority from top to bottom so aggressively.
 I found the sentence, do is on the one hand threatening, on the other hand extremely attractive, on the one hand terrible rage, on the other hand warm, soft fur.
 The wolf lives in the intimate sphere of cultural history. This distinguishes him from the beaver, the crane, the yellow-bellied donkey and also from the fox. And you have to know that if you want to run wolf management.
 Ah, well said.
 And finally, have you ever seen a wolf? Have you ever touched one in a cage?
 And do you recommend that to us, our young viewers?
 I recommend it to young viewers,
 to look at wolves in cages.
 That is the only justification for keeping wolves in captivity.
 That you can raise understanding for the animal species with this view and also understanding for the problems that people have with this animal species.
 I myself have already pet wolves in cages and had wolves in my hand.
 I have also seen wolves in the free wild road, but only once in the Lausitz.
 So it's not like we're here, although I'm very much hunting in Brandenburg,
 with my dogs. In the south of Berlin there is a wolf area.
 There are as many wolves as there has never been before.
 They really have a lot of wolves.
 But I have never seen one hunting.
 It can always happen, but I haven't seen one yet.
 I heard them howling, but I haven't seen one here.
 In the Lausitz I saw wolves when I was on the road with an animal filmmaker.
 And we lay down on the lawn.
 Is that a special feeling or is it not so special for you?
 Because there are often people who say that it was like a new feeling of life.
 Yes, I also thought that you would be a completely different person afterwards.
 But I was rather in a positive sense, exhausted.
 So these wolves were completely normal animals that moved there.
 These were two young wolves who were crawling through the area and weren't particularly excited. They obviously didn't have anything special in mind.
 Anyway, they weren't hunting, but they snuck around and moved like young people.
 They were a bit bored,, walking around the area.
 I found it very unspectacular, and I thought that this unspectacular thing
 should actually spread in the minds of people, that it's not just this torn up rake and this cozy wildness teddy
 that we are
 carrying around in us, but that it is a completely normal wild animal,
 that it follows its needs and in any case does not
 cause us to be annoyed. But it doesn't make us angry.
 And last question about the youth. Do you have problems with the young?
 Does your hunting association need more hunters? Young hunters? Hunters?
 Yes, we need more hunters.
 Hunters in Germany are a bit above the average age.
 But it's not hopeless.
 The number of interested parties for the hunting test is increasing.
 More hunting tickets are being sold.
 There are as many hunters as there ever were.
 So there is hunting offspring.
 And we at the Ecological Hunting Association, we hope of course that some of those who want to become hunters
 will find their way to us and that there might actually be a reform of hunting in Germany, which is definitely urgently necessary, but more hunters are urgently needed.
 It's not that we have fewer problems if we have fewer hunters, but that we could solve some problems better if we had more well-trained hunters longer. That's another final word. Eckart, your books are currently
 The Return of the Wolves. Very, very recommended.
 Read it through. Then we'll maybe talk next time,
 if you liked it, about sheep and pasture keeping.
 You also wrote a book about it. And your current book is
 Hunting Customer. It's about hunting.
 It's about the questions we have at the beginning of the conversation.
 Thank you very much and maybe we'll talk about sheep next time.
 Thank you.
 Ciao. Thank you. I'm going to go to the next one. Thank you. you
