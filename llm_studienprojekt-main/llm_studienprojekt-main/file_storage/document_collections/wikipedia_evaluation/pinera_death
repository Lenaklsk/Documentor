Sebastián Piñera owned a residence in the Coique Bay sector, in the commune of Futrono. Piñera attended a lunch on 6 February 2024, along with his sister Magdalena, businessman Ignacio Guerrero, and Bautista Guerrero, the latter's son, at the home of businessman José Cox, located in the Ilihue sector, in the Lago Ranco commune. Piñera piloted his Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter, registration CC-PHP, across the lake from his residence. After lunch and once the return flight had begun, the aircraft, only a few meters from the shore and having made contact with the surface of the water, lost control and capsized into the waters of Lake Ranco in the Ilihue sector near the take-off site. At 14:57 (UTC−03:00), the Carabineros de Chile received the report of the helicopter crash, while initial reports indicated that there was one fatality and three survivors.

Piñera's body was retrieved by the Chilean Navy from a depth of 28 m (92 ft). His death was confirmed around 17:00 through a statement released by his own press office, and with a statement made by the Minister of the Interior and Public Security, Carolina Tohá. The General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics confirmed that the other three occupants of the aircraft survived. At the time of the crash there had been a strong storm in the area. According to La Nación, he survived the crash itself but the impact left him unconscious and unable to remove his safety belt, resulting in his drowning.

At the Group 10 ramp of the FACh at the airport, the remains and the family were received by President Gabriel Boric, accompanied by some ministers.
